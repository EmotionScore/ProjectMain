my son runs toward me crying he has fallen in the indoor adventure playground the room is enormous an aircraft hangar of soft surfaces spongy balls trampolines and slides it would youd think be a challenge to hurt yourself in this environment but its a challenge my son has accepted he is not alone a steady torrent of children streams from the cushioned gate down the padded steps to run bawling into their parents arms we lie to ourselves that this is a place of fun it is not it is a house of horrors a speedrun through trauma that parents use to toughen their children up the cruel trick of such places is that the price of their enjoyment is a secret lesson in suffering and resilience a kiss on the elbow or a brief hug and theyre back in the game sprinting off for another eightminute chunk of activity until their next lifeending misfortune this juncture between heaven and hell is my sons favourite place on earth and the place he cries most often he calls it the champoline park he often induces me to join him in the ball pits several ftdeep trenches filled with fraying spongy squares in which you can lollop around and hurl padded blocks in all directions i can hereby attest that we have an extremely good time i bought and wear the special grippy socks distributed by the centre just so i can enjoy the ecstasy of tumbling play they offer this is always shortlived after three minutes during which i throw headsized cubes of soft material at his delighted face with enough glee that i should probably examine the psychological roots of this behaviour either he suffers some injury or worse i am forgotten entirely and he races off with people his own height today thats ardal and nora his slightly older cousins whose expert steps he follows across the floor past the trampolines and into the massive padded castleslide in the far corner sadly this is my cue to clamber out of the pit which i do with the stateliness of a drugged hippo leaving the play area to resume my solemn vigil by the railings to the side i look enviously at those mums and dads still getting some use out of their special socks and like everyone else listen out for crying nora is next shes hurt her foot and expresses more pain than i did that time my back hurt so much i thought i was having a cardiac arrest after a second pep talk she takes off to rejoin the maelstrom she is intercepted by my son its his other elbow this time im about to comfort him but nora takes over with the zeal of a convert she takes his hand and tells him not to worry in teaching them to suffer we have taught them to console his tears vanish within seconds theyre leading me back to the cubes and telling me to be careful im fine i say i brought my special socks and everything did ye hear mammy died by samas

fouryearolds and some families with working parents qualify for free hours however providers say the rates they are given for free hours are insufficient forcing nurseries to push up their fees for paying parents the new survey compiled by the early years alliance and the london early years foundation found that about half of providers said children or families at their settings were showing signs of food insecurity with respondents noticing an increase in the number of children arriving hungry while all children in reception year and year attending statefunded schools in england are eligible for a free school lunch state childcare support does not cover provision of food stella freebody manager of the oak tree nursery in ilfracombe devon said she had been helping several families access additional state support as they struggled with costs she also said menus had changed to keep costs down sometimes we have packed lunches brought to the nursery and you can see the impact of the cost of living crisis on those she said with some of them we take a look and then try to make them a sandwich or something like that to try to bulk it out or make it more nutritious our food spend

better provision in the north of england said a scheme helping poorer households with food costs must be expanded food is essential for a childs health growth and development but when families face financial hardship they have no choice but to reduce food quality skip meals cut portion sizes or simply go without she said its about time they took immediate action by supporting preschool children through expanding the healthy start scheme to all families on universal credit and increasing its value in line with inflation to ensure they can have the best start in life a department for education

free childcare a week for disadvantaged twoyearolds and allowed people on universal credit to claim back up to of their childcare costs we recognise that families and earlyyears providers across the country are facing financial pressures and we are currently looking into options to improve the cost flexibility and availability of childcare ensuring that any plans we bring forward focus on

why are we so outraged by nepo babies this is a question of particular interest to nepotism babies themselves who since a recent new york magazine article on the children given a legup by their famous parents have been attracting a level of opprobrium they are finding both unnecessary and unfair after all they say they might get a foot in the door but then they have to work twice as hard and be twice as good or at least prove themselves equal to the task kaia gerber the model daughter of cindy crawford was last week the latest to make a variation on this point which has been repeated so many times by nepo babies down the decades that it has become a sort of proverb lets first take issue with this maxim its just not true the sons and daughters of the famous are helped all the way along the forces that propel them into their first job members of the industry wanting to please their parents are still present at the second and the third no one sacks or underpromotes the child of someone very important if it can possibly be helped why risk torpedoing your own career instead thresholds are lowered sometimes literally lilyrose depp daughter of johnny is just ft in but a stupendously successful model and far from having to work extra hard to prove themselves nepo babies have the scope to fail upwards repeatedly bjrks daughter sadra had her big break at with the film the northman which flopped yet she signed a major modelling contract just two months later give a nepo baby a second or third chance and earn even more gratitude from those influential parents then too they are protected from many of the nasty obstacles their peers may have to deal with no one sane bullies or harasses a nepo baby or drives them from an industry for all but the most heinous of crimes these lucky children can afford to stray confidently outside the usual parameters of behaviour which is a risk but in the arts can be an advantage ultimate industry baby dakota johnson daughter of don and melanie griffith deftly undermined ellen degeneres on her own show which boosted johnsons career but would have been an insane move for a less connected actor in media nepo babies can edge closer to the unsayable all the better for web traffic and stay in the game ok but who cares if a few sons and daughters get to have better careers so long as they meet required standards does it really affect anything if it is gwyneth paltrows daughter apple martin rather than another equally pretty girl who gets the job why are we so exercised about nepo babies well our outsize reaction may say something about the effect unfair reward systems have on us wherever they show up it turns out they are toxic reams of research and stacks of business books tell us that knocking incentives even slightly out of alignment with achievement has a terrible effect on organisations plunging workers into a kind of exhausted cynicism just one conspicuous instance of nepotism can infect an entire company sending job satisfaction rolling downhill along with productivity top employees leave and others stop bothering to compete and what is true for companies is true for industries at large or even societies watching the children of the famous triumphantly straddle the arts is rather like watching gavin williamson get knighted or city bosses awarding themselves bonuses in a mediocre year if the worlds glittering prizes have so little to do with performance whats the point in even trying isnt it natural that parents want to help their children yes and thats the problem nepotism is hard to root out as you are fighting against one of the strongest human instincts parents devote lives and fortunes to giving their sprogs even the tiniest of head starts the actor felicity huffman risked and got jail to give her daughter an edge in college admissions it would be strange if celebrity parents werent calling in favours to get their son to casting and in jobs where ability is rather subjective and connections are everything it is entirely rational for decisionmakers to give jobs to relatives of the famous cast a nepo baby in your play and their parents might come to opening night tell their friends to support it or do you a personal favour later in fact incentives all tend to align towards nepotism until the late s most jobs were simply inherited and the top end of occupations such as sports and politics thick with the sons of the wealthy and connected as zo kravitz daughter of lenny recently told gq its completely normal for people to be in the family business its literally where last names came from you were a blacksmith if your family was like the black family shes right nepotism is completely normal which is what makes the meritocracies of the past century or so such an astonishing achievement societies where talent can rise to the top are wonderful exceptions within the broad sweep of history but hard fought and more fragile than we might imagine we sense this which is perhaps why we react so strongly to the idea of inherited actors and politicians nepo babies are bad for all of us martha gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent do you have an opinion

domestic abuse a government source said labours answer to violence against women and girls is to trot out tired soundbites whereas this government has criminalised controlling behaviour and upskirting

domestic abuse we want to reassure people that it is a priority for the cps and are committed to securing justice in as many cases as we can we are working closely with the police to encourage joint

in the first episode of the fourth season of the simpsons aired in marge and homer see bart and lisa off to summer camp as soon as the bus drives off all the parents start hollering hooting popping bottles of champagne and one parent even shouts dont come back once theyre gone homers hair begins to grow back and he loses weight i was almost when i watched that episode for the first time but i remember my internal monologue with lasersharp precision why would you bother having kids if you cant wait to get rid of them they must be really crap parents and thus began around years of judging parents wondering what all the fuss and complaining was about until i had my own i recently started to think back over the common misconceptions nonparents have about parenting here are three of the most common certainly ones that i subscribed to and the reality of life after you cross the parenting threshold when i have a child i will never put them in front of screens thats just lazy parenting do you have a cleaner a nanny a laundry service a chef a partner who can support the whole family on their salary alone if your answer to these questions is no then parenting is largely going to be your sole responsibility sometimes youre juggling every single thing on that list plus parenting the plumber an electrician and more especially if youre a woman but i dont know a single parent who didnt at least attempt to have a screenfree home for their first child most gave up in the first few months did any attempt screenfree time with a second child insert uproarious laugh here if youre preparing to become a parent and this is in your bag of preconceptions let it go let it go what kind of parent cant stop their kid crying on a planein a restauranton a bus just give them what they want and they will be quiet and everyone will be happier if it was that simple dont you think wed be doing it giving them whatever it is they want we know youre looking at us judging us we want them to stop as much as you do but there is so much you just do not know until you have a child theres a little thing no one tells you about before you become a parent its called the wall when your kids get tired and lose the ability to regulate their behaviour they hit the wall they start crying and they then can get borderline hysterical and like a runaway freight train theres nothing on the face of the earth that you can do or give to stop them the first time i watched this happen with a child i wasnt yet a parent and i thought the kids head was going to spin degrees and we were going to have to call a priest kids are full of raging hormones they go through developmental leaps theres a lot going on in their little bodies and minds and not everything is rational and able to be talked out sometimes they just gotta cry i think the moral of this particular story is there are all sorts of really unpleasant things that we parents dont tell you about beyond giving birth its imperative that this continues because the future of the human race relies on it without it no one would willingly choose to procreate the point here is go easy because theres a hell of a lot you dont know about the magic of parenthood if you have kids you should want to be around them all the time and if you dont why did you have kids in the first place does anyone say this about married couples like you married this person so why dont you want to be around them you must not really love them no one is saying that because we recognise that everyone needs space to themselves or they slowly go completely and utterly off the rails parents have been trying to avoid their kids since the dawn of time from wetnurses to governesses nannies to kinder programs children have always wanted to be away from their parents and parents have always wanted to be away from their children at least for briefish periods of time of course we love them we adore them but absence makes the heart grow um more patient being a parent is hard work being a kid is hard work too theres absolutely no shame in saying hells to the yeah when its time for a break and some time to do all the things you dont get to do when the kids are around with the australian school year starting again next week many parents especially working volunteering exhausted parents are getting ready to drop their kids at the school gate and start their year with a celebratory mimosa or a bloody mary spicy please if youre a parent make sure you relish the opportunity to breathe that nagfree air enjoy your morning coffee or cocktail a quiet fiveminute read of the paper nonparents maybe dont ruin that moment with glares of judgment like the one i would have had plastered all over my sanctimonious teenage face because trust me you just

she looks impossibly small like a beesized human the largeformat lego blocks shes been plopped beside make her already slight dimensions appear positively lilliputian even the other babies around her seem giant in comparison none are older than months and only one appears capable of walking but a couple seem twice her height i remind myself that in any other context these other children would themselves seem selfevidently tiny but placed in context with our daughter they look like they could help me with my car insurance or do my taxes the waterworks havent started yet but the childminder asks me to set up a whatsapp group with her my wife and i that will let us know as soon as they do we hover anxiously until she politely tells us we should go at her request we slink out of the door without looking back feeling like weve placed an incendiary device in her home our daughter is not yet months old but since my wife is set to return to work next month we have begun the process of snipping the apron strings we found a lovely childminder who looks after six babies in her family home a few streets away from our own she is as calm kind and entirely unfussed by the job ahead of her as we are shellshocked and appalled by what were doing its not just that our daughter is small and clingy and she is both of those things its that cutting the apron strings seems manifestly absurd this is not the first time weve introduced a baby to a nursery setting it is exactly the second time that this has happened and we appear to remember nothing to have learned nothing when we did this with our son four years ago it was at a childminders a few miles from our old house so we decamped to a nearby coffee shop to wait it out knowing wed likely have to return sooner than it would take us to get there and back from our home now were doing it all again but at a venue that is barely even a threeminute walk from our house but to go home seems flippant blasphemous even so we make an entirely unnecessary vigil to a coffee shop nearby and sit with our thoughts no alert comes in from the whatsapp group that were definitely not already checking we decide to go home for the first time since she was born we walk into our house together to find no buggy greeting us in the hall for an hour we loiter like guests in our own home pleased but anxious about the silence i head to soho for work and exit the station to a flurry of notifications revealing our daughter is upset should be picked up and indeed has been my wife texts to say she is home after her first two hours of apron

channel s drama series the light in the hall featuring the remarkable joanna scanlan exposes the damage inflicted on the family and friends of a teenager murdered years earlier whose body has never been found hence the light on in the hall and whose alleged killer is released on parole against the wishes of dead girls mother however the mental injuries the injustices inflicted and the disregarded demands of victims are rarely so central after police officer david carricks conviction on charges of rape and domestic abuse the met announced it was reviewing a further cases of domestic and sexual abuse involving more than officers every police force in england and wales is reviewing allegations of domestic and sexual abuse relating to officers dating back a decade potentially thats a significant number of historical victims and more women coming forward but how much faith can they have in what follows victims face loss injury and trauma months pass in which no information is forthcoming about what has happened to their case by last september the crown courts had outstanding cases of them outstanding for more than a year in magistrates courts there were such cases justice is not being seen to be done the victims code establishes principles including a victims right to be kept informed about an investigation and the aftermath support and compensation in a survey in only of victims knew about the code last may after a delay of seven years the government published draft legislation paving the way for the first victims law among the measures victims will have the right to attend parole board hearings and submit questions the crossparty justice committee subsequently delivered a blistering critique of the bills failings and made recommendations last september the redoubtable vera baird resigned as victims commissioner champion of the interests of victims saying that her post had been downgraded and sidelined a new commissioner wont be appointed until the spring so the weak bill may miss some proper scrutiny as it passes through parliament last friday the government said it had accepted some of the committees recommendations including officially classifying bereaved families and the children born of rape as victims in need of increased support the victims commissioners powers will also be strengthened and the number of independent sexual violence advocates and independent domestic violence advocates vital in supporting women will increase from to welcome and yet womens support services are exhausted broken and unable to meet demand let alone a tidal wave that may be triggered by increased confidence that victims voices will be heard the governments promised extra funding is but a brick in a collapsing wall justin russell chief

first of all i must say this a cat is not a baby it is true that i fed her with a bottle like a baby and it is true that she thinks i am her mother that when she kneads the blanket that covers me she is mimicking the milktreading of a feeding kitten it is also true that when everyone else i knew seemed to be pregnant and i was not i used to fantasize about responding to their baby photos with pictures of mackerel my cat is called mackerel because i think it is funny to name a cat after a fish just to see what people said but the truth remains that a cat is not a baby the baby photo thing is perhaps an illustration of how i was mean then i certainly felt mean or at least jealous i left whatsapp groups i skived baby showers i was very happy for people in public and then went home and cried at the same time i wasnt sure if i should become a mother it was a very confusing time you could call it a personal crisis but that makes it sound unique i think lots of women go through it the pushpull of wanting and fearing i was all fear i was certainly aware that there were different levels of love to feel love for a baby was normal to feel love or at least a kind of motherlove for a cat was inappropriate somehow but as mary gaitskill writes in her essay lost cat who decides which relationships are appropriate and which are not i loved love mackerel she makes me laugh every single day with her deadpan face her slapstick antics some days i think she might even love me but like most cat owners i am probably deluded in this what she did do though is teach me how to care again i spent most of my late teens and s trying to avoid looking after anyone this didnt always go to plan again and again i seemed to end up in situations with people who required looking after some of which i engineered myself i moved to paris to become an au pair and unable to cope with the behavioural challenges of one child left one family and fell in love with another i spent my year off caring for six amazing children but when i returned to london with a french boyfriend in tow who also needed looking after i craved independence i had grown up with a severely disabled brother he has autism and epilepsy and i was well versed in the routines and selfsacrifices the exhaustion and the shit and most of all the love that caring for a more vulnerable person entails i wanted none of that wasnt sure even that i would ever or could ever be a mother i felt i had done enough bottom wiping i craved glamour adventure freedom i also knew that the love i felt for my brother was gigantic and at times terrifying i wasnt sure that i had room for anything more not when i wanted to write besides my life felt unstable i had a freelance career lived in rented accommodation we had roommates episodes of ptsd bookended that decade even a cat seemed unfeasible the cat from upstairs used to come into our place and we used to feed him despite the fact that he was supposed to be a vegetarian i liked the feeling of domesticity that the neighbours cat brought with him i had grown up with cats and a house never felt like a home without them once i even went to see some kittens with a view to adopting one but backed out at the last minute i was determined not to take on more responsibility but my heart had other ideas the kitten was tiny when my husband and i brought her home in the warm hallucinatory spring of the first lockdown a time which i believe most of us are yet to fully process her mother had stopped feeding her and so at just six weeks old she required more looking after than i had perhaps anticipated she also seemed so small so vulnerable several times she disappeared she climbed and jumped from a bookcase injuring herself when i took her to the vet to be neutered they couldnt find her womb and had to slice her vertically like they would a dog she was determined to disembowel herself so i slept next to her on the kitchen floor that night i didnt mind this in fact i liked looking after her it gave me a sense of purpose and fulfilment looking after a kitten made me happy at a very difficult time and on the worst days of the pandemic feeding her was the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning it felt good to be needed as in the case of a friend who adopted a cat shortly after a miscarriage caring for an animal helped me understand my complicated longing for a baby at the same time i was aware of the historical stereotypes about women and cats that women who love cats too much are mentally unstable loners who live on the margins acting out their thwarted desire to be mothers just look at the persecution of witches these were often women who lived alone and who either did not have children or possessed the herbal wisdom to terminate a pregnancy a woman without children was suspicious even devilish perhaps if we had not been in a lockdown id have received more barbed comments people would have assumed that i was using the cat as a sort of starter baby however confined as we were to the domestic sphere i managed to escape those remarks but the gendered assumptions about cat ownership interested me the threat posed by childless and childfree women to the natural order seemed to me to be inherent to this idea of the crazy cat lady and though i had always felt at some level that i wanted children and if anything loving this cat only increased that desire the more i read about cat women the more i felt acutely aware of the dichotomy that is drawn between the lives of women who have children and those who do not mackerel turned out to be a trojan cat for all the things i didnt want to confront my fear that i couldnt give a child the life they deserved that my mental health history meant i was unworthy of being a mother my determination not to be needed even though being needed is a part of what makes us human around the time that i finished writing a book about it the pope criticised people of my generation for their tendency to have pets instead of children that it is a form of selfishness a dereliction of duty i thought again of witches and how their persecution coincided with anxieties about the birth rate yet to love and care for an animal is as valid an endeavour as any other form of care i truly believe that i am lucky in large part thanks to mackerel i was able to get past my fear and began to believe that i could be a mother and i got to have my baby my lovely smiley blueeyed boy though at times it has been a challenge and though i have feared for him just as i thought i would i am happy with my choice while holding immense respect for those who choose the other path there is no one way to live a happy fulfilled life there are so many kinds of love in the world mackerel has adjusted well to the presence of my son and he loves her too is desperate to stroke her though she hasnt yet afforded him this privilege she behaves like she is our firstborn insists upon it even i have to remove her from his crib to put him down i wrote this essay in a nearby pub having left them both at home with my mother and while taking a break i got chatting to a man about his puppy how some people say they can be harder work than human newborns but he didnt seem to regret it its another heartbeat in the house he said i liked that i thought it was beautiful the year of the cat is

my husband would describe our parenting style as safetyconscious i would call it riskaverse so how did we end up driving our small children down the freeway through pea soup fog getting blown out of our lane by gusts of galeforce wind hellbent on a holiday despite an emergency warning to avoid nonessential travel i suspect it comes back to my deepseated loathing of grocery shopping or perhaps the trip was doomed from the start my parents were housesitting for some friends on the coast and invited my family and my brothers family to join them as a belated celebration of my dads th birthday a week before we were all due to arrive my brother looked at the forecast saw that his chances of a game of golf were slim to none and promptly cancelled we decided to forge ahead how bad could it be we ate all the food in the house so things wouldnt spoil in our absence we loaded everything into the car the forecast wasnt good but we were hoping to beat the worst of it there were gusty squalls but it didnt seem too bad my parents who my husband has been known to call optimistic to the point of insanity called to suggest that perhaps we should consider staying home that should have been enough to stop us in our tracks but i just could not face unpacking the car and going to get groceries i later found out there was a reconsider nonessential travel warning from the state emergency service sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of mustreads pop culture and tips for the weekend every saturday morning we were just past halfway on an escarpment that normally overlooks the pacific ocean when we found ourselves driving through thick grey clouds that were impervious to the strong gusts of wind sending our car careening in and out of the lanes terrified we pulled off the freeway unable see anything beyond the small car park we were in the wind still rocking our stationary car we debated whether to go forward or back and how to get our family off the damn escarpment alive eventually i called my dad who used to have a pilots licence and has some very detailed weather stats bookmarked together we determined that if we persevered we would likely drop out below the cloud bank we switched drivers and carried on as carefully as we could the fog lifted the wind dropped enough to stop affecting our ability to drive in straight line and we eventually arrived albeit with hungry cranky children and a shattered faith in our parental decisionmaking we had torrential rain for our entire visit local roads were closed due to flooding but we rarely ventured out of the house anyway we have a photo of both grandparents standing in a playground holding umbrellas over our oblivious tots come to think of it that may have actually been the high point of the trip other contenders include trips to bakers delight and a takeaway chinese meal we ventured to the sodden beach one afternoon and admired the savage beauty of nature for three minutes before umbrellas turned inside out my daughters gumboots filled with water and we fled the wild weather made sleeping impossible the restless children made sleeping impossible the capper came after midnight on the final night when in a scene straight out of jimi hendrixs final days my husband walked in on our daughter lying asleep in a pool of her own vomit within days we all had gastro shellshocked we rolled back down our driveway on a brilliantly sunny day four days after we set off and swore never to leave home again,2023-01,husband would describe parenting style safetyconscious would call riskaverse end driving small child

my daughter is and on most days i feel like she barely grunts in my direction she thinks everything i do is cringey and delights in telling me how awful my outfits are so when i went away for five weeks for a writing residency in europe i assumed id get a few sporadic text messages from her but that id basically catch up on her life when i got back instead she called me every single day the first few times she called i assumed she was calling because she needed something when the calls persisted i thought she was buttering me up so that id send her money after a week i realised she was just calling to talk i realised she was replicating our daily routine by touching base with me in the same way as we normally do when we are physically together she was phoning in the afternoons after school typically the time shed be walking into the house initially this surprised me because our afterschool routine is pretty runofthemill she comes in and i yell at her to shut the door so the flies dont get in she and her younger brother grab a snack and i ask how their days have been sometimes theyll mumble something often its just a shrug then were doing homework or im driving them to netball or basketball or one of a zillion other activities i am not at my best in those hours like many women i dropped out of fulltime work when my children were much younger childcare was expensive and on balance it felt easier for one of us to work less i earned less so the decision was straightforward sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of mustreads pop culture and tips for the weekend every saturday morning still it has not been easy to shoehorn my career and my ambitions into school hours and i have sometimes struggled with the juggling act i am often grumpy because there arent enough hours in the day and three oclock often feels like it comes too fast so i would not say our afterschool sessions are the highlight of my day it often feels like the second shift a set of obligations i have to meet yet in insisting that we touch base my daughter was showing me that in those moments after school when she is snacking and changing into her netball gear too slowly for my liking or struggling with a maths problem we are connecting we may be completing chores but for her the time spent together is part of the daily rhythm of her life a way of making sense of the world with the wisdom that often comes so naturally to children she was showing me that cumulatively all those conversations weve had over the years have become greater than the sum of their parts for her the family routine has become a kind of ritual one that is both ordinary and sacred i hadnt seen this at all i was too bound up in the administrative duties of motherhood to fully appreciate the meaning of our shared time by the last week i had fully embraced it here i was talking to this funny and engaging young woman without having to worry about how long she may have been glued to a device or pester her about doing her chores i could just enjoy her and i did with no daily responsibilities i was able to see her for the thoughtful young woman she is becoming with her face framed on my phone screen each time she called our greetings were full of smiles it took me a while to realise it but those smiles werent just a function of the distance our joy at taking one another in at looking at one another with love is part of the script part of how we show one another care when my kids walk through the door each day i am delighted to see them even when i am tired or frazzled there is something about seeing them burst into the house still halfbelonging to the world before they settle down and become their homeselves that always makes me smile looking at myself looking at her i realised that it wasnt just the distance that was making us smile the way we look at each other is as much part of our bond as the chats themselves we love each other by looking at each other with love so there it was simply by calling me consistently while i was away my child taught me to recognise the sacred in the everyday and she showed me that love is quietly joyful as many parents know kids teach us as much as we teach them the wisdom of children lies in their capacity to intuit what matters it lies too in their capacity to share what they know to be true without using complicated words my wise child recognised that the thousands of conversations weve had over the years are the bedrock upon which our mutual trust and companionship are built in doing that she changed the way i look at the everyday in the end she also confirmed what i have suspected for some time now my outfits make her cringe but my love does not sisonke msimang is a guardian australia columnist a public speaker and storyteller

recently someone asked me why i dont mention my baby daughter as much as my son in this column they wondered whether it was to protect her privacy which suggests id made that choice for her while idly recycling everything that happens to my son for content for reasons best known to myself the answer i usually give is that she doesnt do much not least anything i havent covered regarding my son theres also the fact that her babyhood has corresponded with a particularly eventful period in my sons life his speech has exploded hes started school and comes home every day filled with new wonders neither of these explanations is untrue but they also dont tell the full story the fact is for the first eight months of her life she has been well a baby and babies are quite unreasonable i didnt want to complain about the constant crying or refusing to sleep or her reticence to bond with me her perfect father because i presumed it would be reductive and boring not to mention eerily reminiscent of the times i wrote about my son doing the same things four years ago to write about one baby being hard work is unfortunate to do it twice smacks of carelessness whatever the case i have been remiss so i can redress that now at nine months old she is very nearly perfect with a small biscuity face a laugh that could cure a migraine and a smile that could melt glass she enjoys melty sticks and big fake kisses on her tummy she has no teeth but bizarrely powerful legs and looks likely to walk before she turns a year old which will be a nightmare she worships her mother on whose face she plants gummy toothless kisses all day long she adores her brother whose every appearance she greets like an old irish lady getting a visit from daniel odonnell she is aware of her fathers existence and wishes me well she has recently developed a fondness for clapping its unlikely she gained this skill from her mother a woman unburdened by rhythm of any kind and who is in fact so incapable of keeping time that her own clapping sounds broadly identical to a bucket of human hands being emptied down a well my daughter has the grip of a scrum half and the bowel movements of a professional darts player she has a tickly spot on her cheeks that will soothe her when shes in great distress things which cause her great distress include basically everything she is the one child on earth who detests car seats and refuses to sleep when in motion she sometimes rolls on to her back and cant get up but appears to find this situation hilarious and will laugh uncontrollably as she struggles with futility to right herself at this we too will laugh and before long her clapping starts she is in short a marvel and if thats not worth a round of applause i dont know what is did ye

it takes a village to raise a child according to the old proverb that may have little meaning for the majority of parents today but the proper place for institutions outside the family in the birth and rearing of our children is a pressing matter indeed and recent evidence suggests that government is grievously failing parents in many ways it starts even before birth a new report out last week from the care quality commission cqc highlighted a worrying decline in womens experiences of nhs maternity services in england the trend comes in the wake of a number of inquiries into the appallingly poor maternity care on offer in some hospital trusts it is estimated that more than babies die or are left with severe injuries each year as a result of something going wrong during labour and the cqc has found four in maternity services are providing unacceptable levels of care this goes beyond the general resourcing and staffing issues within the nhs that have created its biggest ever crisis it reflects a cultural underprioritisation of the care of women and their babies that has not been adequately addressed by successive administrations government policy also has a marked influence on the context within which parents bring up their children how expensive it is to have a child the level of support on offer when things go wrong and the ease with which you can juggle looking after your child with maintaining a career and as a result of political decisions over the last decade britain has undoubtedly become a more hostile place to bring up a family rising energy and food bills have pushed up the already high cost of raising a child to the age of even further the child poverty action group has estimated the average figure is now for couples and for lone parents even if both parents work full time at the minimum wage they will fall more than a year short of the income needed to attain a basic minimum standard of living this reflects the fact that as wages have stagnated over the last decade the cost of living including housing food and energy has increased and government support for lowpaid parents has been significantly scaled back since successive conservative chancellors have reduced tax credits and benefits for lowincome families with children while introducing tax cuts that have benefited the better off a redistribution not just from the less to the more affluent but from families with children to those without this has undermined the financial safety net that was put in place for families by the last labour government in recognition of the fact that britain has too many jobs that simply do not pay enough for parents to be able to provide for their children little wonder then that child poverty rates have risen since with almost one in three children now living in poverty longterm issues in the housing market have also introduced much greater uncertainty in relation to raising children rising house prices mean more parents will never be able to afford to buy their own home one in five households now live in privately rented accommodation up from one in years ago the proportion will continue to rise with more children being brought up in rented homes this not only has a huge impact on living standards britain has the most expensive rents in europe but on safety and security a quarter of homes in the private rented sector do not meet the governments minimum decent homes criteria also renters remain vulnerable to shortterm tenancy agreements at the end of which they can be kicked out of their homes sometimes necessitating a move and a change of school the growing numbers of parents who rent deserve to be able to achieve much greater stability for their children through controlled rents and longterm tenancies the other huge financial outlay for parents is childcare particularly for young children not yet at school new figures out this month show britain now has the jointhighest childcare costs of any oecd country government support with these costs is patchy and it is hardest to access quality nursery provision in the least affluent areas yet highquality childcare provision is associated with better educational outcomes particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds higher levels of parental wellbeing and better economic outcomes for women modelling by the institute for public policy research suggests that investing in universal free childcare for the underfives would boost economic growth and result in a higher tax take the decision about whether and when to have children is deeply personal but the high costs involved and the increasingly antifamily sheen of government policy mean that many parents cannot give their children the level of security they aspire to affecting the rest of their lives it also likely puts some people off having children with wider consequences for the whole of society given the higher tax burden that britains low birthrate will impose on future generations the governments neglect of children and families has profound repercussions not only for the kind of society we are today but for what we will become in the future,2023-01,take

i tried to look up baby fever but all that came up is information about an infants vitals and how to take their temperature its more of an american term baby fever in british english we are more likely to say broody which comes from hens but theres something benign and cosysounding about that word a friend once asked me if i was clucking to mean do you feel a desire to get pregnant i had never heard it before but again it was too nice for what i was feeling which was at times dark and desperate and jealous and mean in my memoir the year of the cat which is published this month i try to pinpoint that feeling of longing because it seemed to me that literature had still not fully explored it perhaps because it can feel so deep and primal and beyond words in the end i am forced to resort to welsh to describe it i use the word hiraeth which means to feel longing for a place or a person or a time that feels like home but may never have existed except in your imagination thats as close a description as i have been able to reach and i think it goes some way to explaining that feeling of recognition that people describe when they meet their child for the first time an oh its you in laura marlings song for you one of the few tracks i can think of that put these emotions into words she sings that i had called out for you almost every night and when you came into my life it takes one to know one and i saw you there as i had seen you all my life that song is now on the babys playlist and every time i listen to it i think about the longing of course i have been lucky because my wish came true perhaps that is why i am able to write about it now though as i was writing my book i was not pregnant so there was always a risk that it would be published and id be asked about these difficult emotions without them being resolved regardless of what happened in my own story though i wanted to write it for all the women and men because men can feel a strong longing for a child too who are sitting with these often unspoken feelings who raise glasses of champagne to their friends happy announcements but cry on the way home and then feel guilty because that knot of feeling is primal and complicated and sometimes ugly it can be hard to say to people you love that you want what they have sometimes its easier to just leave the whatsapp group or skive the baby shower when i did some research about the longing of which as with so many things to do with female reproduction there is of course little written most papers and studies suggested that the visceral physical and emotional feeling of wanting to have a baby is largely socialised as opposed to hormonal a kansas state university study named three factors having positive interactions with babies such as playing and cuddling the extent of negative exposure to babies which dampens the desire and how someone views the tradeoffs of parenthood those with baby fever see only the positive impacts on their life a fertility expert said in one article about baby fever far be it for me to argue with experts but i know what i felt i was acutely aware of the negative impact that having a baby could have on my life and was for a long time in a sort of paralysis but it didnt change the visceral longing i felt or which many others describe anecdotally friends have said that their longing ebbs and flows with their cycles older women who felt it premenopause have also said that it wanes with time though others have had to learn to live with it their entire lives some women and again men have never felt it at all and ive always wondered if there are evolutionary reasons for this because to have every member of a tribe occupied with childcare is hardly going to help when trying to ward off predators are the women i know who have never wanted children simply immune to social pressure or is it something inherent perhaps we are all just socialised to blame our hormones whatever the reason they are sick of being told that their feelings will change all i know is that until we speak honestly about longing at least within our families and friendship groups it will continue to come out in ways that can be uncomfortable when a friend said that her sister had ruined every single family occasion for this reason i could see both sides fertility messageboards and support groups can offer some comfort to those going through the longing but for many childless couples it remains a difficult thing to speak about this is one of the few things in life that our capitalist economy cannot provide a failsafe solution for you can try to spend your way out of the problem but there are no guarantees the whims of the female body remain mysterious and ungovernable thats why the longing is still so stigmatised to want what you perhaps cant have the desperation of that feeling its something many would rather not know about which is why i felt compelled to write about it whats working the babys door bouncer is really coming into its own now as hes desperate to be on the move but isnt crawling we tend to be bum shufflers in my family when hes in it he does a pleasing little irish jig will the exercise tire him out enough to get him back to sleeping through the night we can only hope whats not his babybjrn bouncer pricey but a genuine lifesaver and you can get them secondhand is however at the end of its usefulness how we will mourn its passing as a failsafe way to get the baby to sleep and he loved rocking himself to music most recently anarchy in the uk i cant seem to find

childcare is back in the news thanks to liz truss lamenting rishi sunaks decision to dump her childcare proposals including the scrapping of staffchild ratios for nurseries but there are deeper reasons for childcares increasing role in our policy debates rising female employment requires more childcare and a conservative party nervous about relying on older voters occasionally turns to a childcare policy offer for the squeezed middle aged after all subsidising childcare is more manageable than buying every angry millennial a house research supports the idea that a focus on childcare can deliver dividends a new paper examines what happened to fouryearolds in boston massachusetts where a lottery determined who got a publicly funded preschool place at the turn of the millennium comparing those who diddidnt get in researchers find lasting impacts those attending were more likely to graduate from high school and more likely to immediately enrol at university driven by improved behavioural outcomes not better test results its boys who mainly benefit which matters when far fewer men than women have been going to university since the mids but this preschool was publicly provided with more highly qualified staff than we require in the uk if we want better outcomes for kids the quality matters but if what were after is higher employment rates for mothers higher volume not quality childcare might be the priority a german study shows that proactively supporting poorer mothers to apply for childcare places helps overcome low takeup and boosts maternal employment so politicians should focus on childcare but also decide what the goal is better outcomes for children higher employment for women or cheaper childcare for those already working torsten bell is chief

the first time my toddler threw a tantrum her head spun degrees flames replaced her pupils the walls rumbled and she chanted a satanic curse in latin well at least thats how i remember it i wouldnt give her popcorn it was tucked away high in the top cupboard and as much as i pretended not to know what joey wanted she knew i was holding out her face went red and her lungs erupted at months old it was the first time shed complained about anything for longer than a few minutes her crying turned into screaming her sooky cuddle warped into an awful whiplash out of my arms followed by wild back arches and body throws all over the floor she wouldnt be picked up let alone touched the tantrum was in full throttle ten minutes in and we were both crying i offered her everything the popcorn a dummy my breast netflix my phone a note id have let her smash a faberg egg if we had one handy but the screaming continued we walked around the block both in tears we walked around again i wanted to scream but she was doing enough of that for the both of us eventually i put her on my bed and walked away after a couple of minutes of crying she lay down and fell asleep the whole tantrum lasted close to an hour i felt useless i lay on the couch and cried calling my partner at work to check if our toddler was indeed correct and i was as the whole neighbourhood had heard the worst mum in australia sign up for our rundown of mustreads pop culture and tips for the weekend every saturday morning isaac insisted it was normal but he couldnt be trusted he hadnt seen the daggers in her eyes i texted mum and minutes later my phone buzzed as the family network went into advice overdrive mum suggested i put her in the bath an aunty suggested picking her up and dangling her upside down my cousin sent a message of solidarity my only advice is bribe or distract dont change their mind theyre bloody stubborn and youll always lose it was possibly the most awful hour of my life as a new parent and id had plenty of sleepless nights bouts of childcare conjunctivitis and an episiotomy without pain relief but that hour home alone with a tantruming toddler took the cake the day would surely come up in future counselling sessions hers and mine never had she done something that felt so personal she hated me never had i felt so useless when i was pregnant people warned of tantrums but no one said how souldestroying they could be no one told me the warbling cries of a newborn turn into that of a small human it was a new mature pitch that made me simultaneously languish and lactate and suddenly she could bite scratch and maintain eye contact i felt as if id been hurled abuse from a stranger or been in a roadrage incident this tiny adult had gone straight for my throat if she could talk i know shed be calling me every swearword in the book if she was my size im sure shed have me in a headlock instead she erupted those big feelings spilled out with the help of some halfread articles and advice from fellow parents i started to figure out what was going on in joeys brain of course it must be annoying to want popcorn and not understand why mum is withholding reason and logic just havent worked their way into those little brains yet and im no stranger to a good tantrum too the moment im annoyed i feel a pit of anger in my stomach that usually expels itself as a threepage text that i then delete a heated conversation with my partner a run a magnum ego or a series of deep breaths poor joey doesnt even have a phone let alone the ability to write a passiveaggressive essay to me about how withholding popcorn is akin to child abuse after that first tantrum joey woke up from her sleep as happy as can be i had my prepared apology while she seemed completely over it there have been plenty of tantrums since one at the shops plenty at the dog park and to my relief at least two with my partner while ive been out my coping mechanism now is simply knowing they end ive trawled every inch of the internet in search of the simple solution to stop a toddlers fury and am convinced none exist the idea of sitting a tantruming joey down and explaining to her calmly why she cant have popcorn would be like trying to put a fire out with a wet wipe knowing tantrums are normal doesnt make them less awful but it does make me in awe of the parents before

brace yourself for selfdriving strollers cocaine is gods way of saying that youre making too much money robin williams once joked god also might have a few choice words to say about a new selfdriving stroller unveiled at the ces tech show in las vegas the ella smart stroller uses artificial intelligence to navigate and is filled with bells and whistles like a white noise machine and an automatic parking brake its the tesla of strollers basically you dont need to be a technology expert to know that selfdriving technology is still in a very early stage and is riddled with issues teslas driver assistant system for example has been accused of running over child dummies tesla has rejected this claim and called it defamatory would you really trust a selfdriving stroller with your precious cargo well heres the thing the stroller is only selfdriving when its empty its designed to be used when youre carrying your kid in the park for example and dont have a spare hand to push the stroller which means the selfdriving tech is perfectly safe for your own child and only a potential danger to other peoples kids ever notice how a lot of technology seems to be like that convenience and personal safety is purchased at the expense of public safety people drive around in enormous suvs which pose a danger to pedestrians for example but which promise to keep their own kids safe forget all the potential safety issues for a moment though is there really a market for selfdriving strollers the depressing answer is yes very much so strollers arent just transportation tools after all they have become status symbols bugaboos used to be the it stroller now upmarket neighbourhoods are full of uppababy travel systems maybe in a few years the ella will have usurped the uppababy as the bougie buggy of choice if people want to spend a small fortune on a stroller thats up to them the bigger issue here is the way in which pregnancy and parenthood have been thoroughly commodified it wasnt always like this as recently as the early th century marketing targeted at children and mothers was seen as a kind of profane violation of the sanctity of the home amanda parrish morgan notes in an essay for jstor now however you become a prime target for marketers the moment you get a positive pregnancy test if you want to be a good parent and keep your kids safe advertisers insinuate then you need to shell out on baby cameras that monitor your kids breathing and smart socks that track your little ones heart rate and selfdriving strollers while some of these products do make parenting easier kitting your kid out in tracking devices can also make you more paranoid the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads a former facebook executive once

benefits at twitter this is the guy let me remind you who has fathered multiple children through fertility technology like ivf this is the guy who keeps going on about how everyone should have loads

since having a baby i have never felt more creatively inspired and never more frustrated the fire is still on im just on the back burner i might say one of the phrases in the artist andi galdi vinkos transcendent photo book sorry i gave birth i disappeared but now im back it chronicles motherhood in all its strange visceral leaky realism as well as its naturalistic beauty recently it has become a visual bible for me as i wonder what it is to be on the back burner or even to disappear at a time when the tension between caring and creating has never felt more acute in order to do both you have to it seems put the proverbial baby on the fire escape its probably apocryphal but this is what the painter alice neels inlaws claimed she did in order to work ive been savouring the book the baby on the fire escape creativity motherhood and the mindbaby problem these past months it looks at how celebrated female artists and writers such as neel doris lessing alice walker and ursula k le guin navigated the demands of motherhood into the need to create the author julie phillips tried to find a common thread between how these women made it work but instead was confronted with a negative space an impossible position whether it is relying on a network of othermothers for support having a partner who does their share or more of the care going it alone building a career first or finding success late there is no easy way to be an art monster while also trying to raise a child in the absence of societal encouragement or approval women have had to find their own ways through that tension some of them not always admirable some like lessing lost access to their children the common narrative continues to be that she fully abandoned them without looking back which says it all really others had strained or distant relationships with their offspring but many flourished too as did their children what these women all needed phillips concludes was time how they achieved that differed toni morrison got up to write before her children woke le guin didnt because hers would always stir when she did but heroically each of them endeavoured to find ways around it barbara hepworth claimed that taking as little as half an hour a day for herself to allow the images to build in ones mind was enough to maintain her artistic consciousness while caring for triplets they also needed a sense of self it is so easy to be entirely sublimated by motherhood to allow your self to be annihilated to demand boundaries to assert that you have a right to make art that requires strength and conviction it is as phillips has it a heros journey to put the baby on the fire escape is not to literally leave your child out in the cold but it is the ability to put the baby out of your mind for the time required to create something else thats not to say youre immune to guilt it can feel like a constant tug of push and pull the need to be present for your child versus the desperate need to create it is far from easy many women know this it is the tension at the heart of sheila hetis book motherhood in which her narrator eventually decides not to sacrifice her artist self through motherhood there was a time when i feared every baby might be a book i didnt write the proverbial pram in the hall as the enemy of all good art still haunts so many of us though it is a nonsense furthermore as vinko and a long line of female artists before her have shown the experience of motherhood also lends itself to groundbreaking works interrogating and interpreting it i left my baby to write this when all he wanted was to nestle close to me and feed and sleep while writing my body has literally ached for him this will ease with weaning but that knowledge sits with the fact that i will only have so many of these days and that i have never not since he was born been fully present for him because there is a treacherous part of me that will always need to write i believe that i have the sense of self to do it but sometimes it can feel exhausting the temptation to put down ones pen or ones paintbrush can be immense but as the swedish artist and writer emma ahlqvist writes in her book my body created a human i dont want my child to grow up having the pressure of having a parent who has given up everything in their life for them she concludes that having limited time has made me realise what i really need in my life and that is to make art of course in order to keep going as a mother and an artist you need an art world or a publishing world that is hospitable to both mothers and works about motherhood hettie judahs how not to exclude artist mothers and other parents is a manifesto for change at every level from art schools to studios to institutions and beyond as she writes when an artist discovers she is pregnant she should not immediately be gripped by the anxious prospect of having commissions cancelled abandoning her studio practice and losing sight of a fruitful career parenthood should be the start not the end of things whats working the updated jauntier postman pat theme song came on automatically after some nursery rhymes and i thought the baby was going to explode with laughter he was in complete hysterics particularly when the cat appeared it was gorgeous to see especially as hes been having a tricky time recently whats not sleep

im not sure how it happened but there has been a huge explosion in the number of babies around me one minute my friends and i were all at the pub having too many beers for a thursday evening and the next a flock of storks descended upon us everywhere i turn there is a friend announcing pregnancy or a friend bedridden with pregnancy vomiting or me a regular person vomiting when someone posts one of those d ultrasounds of their baby sorry theyre haunting and im scared or a babys first birthday or a brand new baby to visit its babies galore and i could not be happier not only are children cute but with each infant brought into my life i can more deeply inhabit the life role i have been granted i am a childless gay aunt let me run you through what i mean i am gay i am childless and i am an aunt its important to note here that when i talk about being an aunt i dont just mean children i am related to by blood being queer and building community means forming special bonds with your friends even the straight ones establishing friendships that are like family reinforcing the love care and support that you choose to give and hopefully seeing it last the coming decades i have always had a soft spot for aunts of all kinds there was nothing i loved more growing up than the special treat of getting to leave my brothers at home while i went to stay in another city with one of my hilarious smart outspoken aunts in the sweet spot i was old enough to have fun with them and try sips of wine while they were young enough to not yet be interested in settling down for a short magical window i had all their attention before it was cruelly ripped away by the births of their own children becoming a cga is not something that i chose i knew i was queer from an early age but the childless part is just the way the cookie has crumbled and by cookie i mean my disused uterus unless something surprising happens i am probably going to remain childless that will free me up to reach the peak of my gay aunt powers all the biology at play inside me forcing me to enjoy the smell of a babys head or giving me the instinct to keep a baby in my care alive will not be funnelled into my own offspring but instead flung out at the babies around me im not trying to claim that any type of aunt is superior all of them are wonderful they love you and are excited to see you treat you a little bit like an adult and spill secrets about your parents along with regular aunts cgas also have a strong alliance with guncles gay uncles and cool young uncles but the cga is progressive fun cosmopolitan she has all the streaming services you can talk to her about everything because there is nothing she loves more than gossip and you know she will be chill most importantly you can rely on her never to have children except for the series of tabby cats she weirdly insists on calling her babies and give you her undivided attention it may just be the kind of kid i was and what i craved from life but that seems to be the ideal its a role im excited to fill i know some people struggle with their friendship group changing as children are born but for this cga it has been a delight sure your friends might not have as much time for you now but it feels special to watch someone you love become a parent it is also fascinating and funny to see someone youve witnessed do things like drink a beer out of a shoe get equally pumped about their baby taking a bottle its lovely to see them evolve and prioritise this person theyve made it is so special to me to be invited to be part of my friends lives and to be chosen as one of the people they want to have an influence on their baby it is even more special to be able to give the baby back when you leave and go on to sleep soundly for eight hours every night in your own bed this is the prerogative of a cga im excited to see what kind of people all these babies turn out to be and i cant wait to force them to spend time with me forever rebecca shaw is

like many new mums i love ticking off milestones rolling crawling sucking on toes that last one might not be a milestone but it sure is cute as my son approached one however nothing was more exciting than the prospect of his first words my partner was equally keen we strained our ears for any passing similarity to mama or dada cat car or dog all the important nouns we thought usually made up first words in the end he preferred making animal noises before naming loved ones or objects but he got to those too when his uncle was visiting from interstate he asked me what his actual first word was i paused i didnt know his first words were so tentative the line between babble and deliberate speech blurred after some babbling of my own i settled for saying cheese and we all laughed a few months later i stumbled upon a study in the journal of child language the author of the study amalia skilton mentioned that words such as this and that or here and there known as demonstratives are often among childrens first words there was a niggling at the back of my mind a memory of certain dis and dat sounds my son was making around the time he started mooing or even earlier in languages like english spanish italian and mandarin with simple demonstrative structures these words often occur in the first words learned by children and with great frequency skilton writes this early emergence and high production frequency are typically attributed to demonstratives close relationship with joint attention demonstratives are words designed to draw direct and align your focus joint attention is when two people focus on an object or event to interact with each other its integral to the development of a childs social and cognitive skills as an avid parenting book reader id come across this term before but only in the context of gestures such as pointing according to holger diessel and kenny r coventry authors of a study of demonstratives in social interaction most research on joint attention has been concerned with nonverbal means of communication notably with pointing and eye gaze i delighted in my sons abilities to direct me to the things and places he wanted to see with an outstretched index finger i commented on each and every one but none of my reading discussed linguistic means of initiating joint attention i missed his early verbal attempts to attract and direct my attention believing them still to be babble not only this i missed the attempts he made to share his perspective of the world with me diessel and coventry acknowledge that establishing joint attention is no mean feat it requires that the people involved see each other as mental or intentional agents i know that from a very early age if not birth babies are intelligent and aware beings their repeated attempts to reach and roll and knock over the pot plant are not accidental but remembering this and treating them as such on a day to day hour to hour basis is not so easy even now that my son is parroting everything i say swear words included i still talk about him and things as if hes not there so i defaulted to the ageold assumption that babies arent up to much and dismissed any feelings that his babble had started to change it was surely too early i was just getting carried away hes not really talking not yet but now communicating with my son is one of my greatest joys as a mum now two years old each day he is saying more words stringing together longer sentences and indulging me in greater conversations with the knowledge i have now i feel sure that he was making deliberate attempts at speech before i recognised them while i may mourn the opportunity to confidently declare his first word as i did his first smile and first steps missing it didnt damage my sons language development or our relationship there were plenty of other words and gestures i engaged with even occasionally the dat i only halfbelieved meant anything now his favourite phrases still include demonstratives this way here it is this one sit here and he still says that to ask what things are and adds each new answer to his vocabulary a demonstrative might not be as exciting as cat or dog to say when asked what your childs first word was but the real excitement is in the interaction the communication and finding that you and your little one are on the same page sarah fallon writes

liz truss has urged rishi sunak not to ditch her childcare changes aimed at reducing costs the former prime minister was aiming to scrap mandatory staffchild ratios in nurseries while increasing free childcare support by hours a week to help tackle the labour crisis ditching staffchild ratios would have allowed nurseries to cut costs by increasing the number of children each adult could be responsible for currently one adult is expected to supervise every eight children aged three and one adult for every four children aged two her plans would have gone further than those of her predecessor boris johnson who launched a consultation to ease the ratio for twoyearolds to five children for each member of staff matching scottish regulations truss had also hoped to extend free childcare support for three and fouryearolds to hours a week parents in england with children aged three and four are currently entitled to hours of free childcare a week sunak is understood to be considering offering hours of free childcare support to all children between the ages of two and four as only parents claiming benefits can currently claim free childcare for their twoyearolds although truss did not formally announce her proposals she has long been in favour of changes to childcare since she worked in the education department as a junior minister almost a decade ago a number of conservative backbenchers have expressed concern that sunak does not appear to be giving childcare enough of a priority in his agenda to such an extent that the commons education select committee is set to launch an inquiry into the issue of childcare costs a source close to liz truss told the guardian excessive bureaucracy is making childcare in england increasingly unaffordable for many parents the system needs to be reformed in order to boost growth and opportunity junking lizs plans for this critical policy area seems economically and politically counterproductive a joint report welcomed by the labour party revealed that free universal preschool childcare and more funding for afterschool clubs could increase government revenues and save a family with young children between and a year the institute for public policy research ippr and the charity save the children have called for a universal childcare guarantee for all families until the end of primary school to allow more women to get back into work and reduce the attainment gap between rich and poor children in their early years the shadow education secretary bridget phillipson criticised sunak for delaying changes to the childcare system she said accessible affordable childcare is essential for children for families for our economy but the prime minister doesnt care the tories have given up on

a trailblazing childrens centre in one of the uks poorest towns that inspired the creation of sure start is facing closure because of local council cuts pen green in corby northamptonshire a global beacon of early years expertise that pioneered wraparound care bringing together a nursery parental support and health and social services under a single roof said it would shut if the conservativerun north northamptonshire council pushed ahead with of cuts pen greens chair adam cooper said the threatened removal of its integrated services made a mockery of the governments levelling up aspirations and would be a catastrophe for lowincome families with young children in an area where many were struggling with rising poverty amid the cost of living crisis losing the integrated services offering at pen green will have a catastrophic impact on the longterm outcomes and the lives of young children and their families in corby these cuts equate to a loss of approximately of our funding each year and of the funding for integrated services cooper said much loved locally where it serves about families a year pen green also has a national and international reputation for its innovative services it has trained thousands of early years workers runs a thriving research centre and attracts hundreds of visitors a year from countries seeking to emulate its approach the cuts were approved at a full council meeting on thursday days after the government trumpeted a m rollout of family hubs in english local authority areas these provide a version of the wraparound early years services pioneered by pen green and further developed in labours sure start scheme although north northamptonshire was one of the areas in england chosen for investment pen green said council officials had told it privately that it would not receive any of the governments family hub funding the council has so far refused to say who or what will provide the family hub service or whether it will be based in corby pen green has faced financial jeopardy several times in its year history and this is the second time in the space of a year that it has faced an existential threat it was saved at the th hour last march when the council backed down midway through a packed and emotional council meeting north northamptonshire has defended the cuts on the basis that it is unfair that pen green should receive a greater share of nursery grant funding than the other three council nurseries in the authority it said it wanted every child to receive the same access and quality of provision no matter their postcode the councils leader jason smithers said we do recognise the value and importance of early education for children across north northamptonshire we have worked to ensure a fair equitable and transparent funding arrangement for all four of our maintained nurseries to ensure that children and families accessing early education can continue to do so in their own communities pen green described this as a levelling down approach that failed to recognise the extra pressures of serving families in the councils most socially deprived postcodes and the added costs of the extensive range of services it provided over and above those offered by the councils other nurseries corbys tory mp tom pursglove said he opposed the cuts he has offered to broker meetings between pen green the council and the childrens minister claire coutinho in an attempt to minimise the impact of the cuts which he said had become a source of anxiety for his constituents he said i am clear that the risk of the integrated centre being lost or radically scaled down must be addressed as i recognise the enormous difference it makes to so many local families and for my part i will continue to work

if a stranger slaps your bottom is it bad behaviour or bad manners to complain because they meant it as a compliment in the battle to end the harassment women face in their everyday lives the discussion has often centred on how women can do more to protect themselves rather than stopping those who feel they are entitled to touch pester and target others as parliament debates new laws on public harassment on wednesday we can change this but only if we stop excusing criminal behaviour as clumsy seduction that means being clear that when it comes to harassing women it is no defence to argue you didnt mean any harm because in you really should know better for women learning to live is learning to be afraid if you want the freedom of movement it comes at a cost we teach selfdefence in schools the merits of carrying keys in your hands to walk home to worry about not having such a good time on a night out that youre unaware of the person standing too close to you and to worry about who can be trusted if you go to them for help our calculations using ons data suggest that every day women experience public harassment in the uk with those from minority communities much more likely to be affected schoolage girls report experiencing this harassment every day and that their peers are slow to learn to stop it one study in northern ireland showed that only of the boys thought it was never acceptable to catcall wolfwhistle or shout at someone if street harassment is widespread so too is a sense that those charged with tackling it minimise it the campaign group our streets now states that of pupils dont feel confident reporting public sexual harassment to a member of staff at school let alone the police in november house of commons library data showed that more than million crimes against women had gone unrecorded since and women are much less likely than men to report abuse to the police with extensive evidence of how those responsible escalate their behaviour they start following women down the road and flashing them but rarely stop there women dont need to be given rape alarms or better street lighting but a plan of action thats why we should all welcome the protection from sexbased harassment in a public bill it echoes the way that hate crime legislation penalises those who target certain groups based on their identity by using an existing offence used to prosecute harassment from the public order act and applying a harsher sentence to those whose motivation is shown to be about the sex or perceived sex of their victim it is the first time the statute book will recognise how misogyny drives crimes against women yet as ever nothing is straightforward public order offences allow the accused to claim a defence that they thought their behaviour was reasonable even if no one else would this contrasts with other legislation that also covers harassment in english law and only allows a defendant to claim their behaviour is reasonable if others would agree that they ought to know if their conduct was unacceptable without changing this element of the forthcoming public harassment bill to be consistent with how harassment operates elsewhere this new law while wellintentioned risks giving perpetrators the opportunity to claim she just cant take a compliment as an actual defence to a criminal offence there is still time to close this legal loophole with the support of mps in the coming weeks we can ensure that all harassment offences deal in the same way with claims of reasonableness by defendants towards their victims its clear the public would agree according to one survey one in three people think that sexist abuse should lead to more than a year in prison it will take more than a single offence to undo the generations of cultural hardwiring that says men harass women because they like them in an era of andrew tate repeated failed metoo prosecutions and the scandal of the police rapist wayne couzens there is so much to address but it is a start which is why it matters to get this right a growing majority of young men and modern culture is increasingly questioning the ethos that boys will be boys the law must too

everyone in north london has the same pushchair i exaggerate slightly but not by much the babyzen yoyo a compact stroller that folds down small enough to go in a planes overhead compartment is a phenomenon on the pavements at the library outside the childrens centre they are ubiquitous at about they are not the cheapest but i have observed that their ownership transcends the sort of rich millennial parents who work at google and own large townhouses around these parts they are used by all kinds of families if you were to nominate a bit of parenting kit that defines my generation of parents at least those who live in cities though friends from the countryside have hired them to go on holiday this would probably be a good example designed as it is with travel flexibility and mobility in mind although an earth grandmother type might say that all you need for a baby is a sling a pair of breasts and a drawer baby products are big business the average amount that new parents spend on baby equipment according to a report is a study found that of parents felt theyd overspent on baby gear and you can understand why not only is the social media marketing relentless but many companies make big promises usually to do with sleep the guilttripping and fearmongering can be intense and as a recent feature in this newspaper highlighted could even be making us more paranoid like the mother in that article who threw money at trying to solve her babys wind problem ive sometimes been taken in by claims that purport to be the solution to whatever stage the baby is at with mixed results on the other hand never has product design felt more important than it has in parenthood the book and social media account designing motherhood the former published by mit with the subtitle things that make and break our births highlights the designs that have helped define the relationship between parents and their babies over the past century from the babybjrn sling of which im a huge fan to the incubator likewise i had a premature baby to the breast pump the strides made in breastpump design alone have been transformative and liberating the elvie wearable breast pump is such a far cry from the industrialfeeling milking machines of the past and ill never forget how it helped me establish breastfeeding after my son was in intensive care similarly i could weep in gratitude at the genius of ewan the dream sheep who helped him learn to sleep through the night listening to an old episode of parenting hell i discovered that josh widdicombe is also among ewans legions of fans of course all babies are different and theres no guarantee that what will work for one parent will work for another but some design classics have stood the test of time the stokke tripp trapp high chair for example turns this year and has revolutionised how generations of children eat a friend of mine says her family still sit on the ones she and her siblings had as babies perhaps thats why we are liable to be a bit sentimental about some baby gear the best examples become part of family life making it all just that little bit easier when i realised that my son was frustrated by how constrained he felt by his baby sleeping bag a latenight google search turned up the bugbag which has split legs and allows him to sleep in his favoured starfish position the little sock company makes miraculous socks that dont come off even when he rubs his feet together in the pram the rockit pram rocker does exactly what it says on the tin freeing your hands so that you can eat lunch often these small businesses have been founded by parents who have spotted a gap in a market because nothing gets you thinking about what would make your life easier than tending a newborn for example i loved the bassinet of our ark pushchair but as i pounded the pavements i used to wish for one that had builtin speakers that played white noise and a selection of classical music so that i didnt have to put my phone in with him one dad i know fantasised about some sort of device that could take you from a standing to a lying down position without disturbing the baby on your chest when i asked parents on twitter a whole range of weird and wonderful ideas were put forward from a wrong trousersstyle dressing machine for active toddlers to earplugs that cut out your partners snoring but are still linked to the baby monitor one mums dream is a replica of my hand that would automatically pat the bottom of a sleeping baby a washingup glove full of uncooked rice on some sort of pendulum perhaps while another wishes for a product that can automatically return a dummy to a babys mouth these may be fanciful but who knows what the future holds what i do know is that psychologically and emotionally the right baby gear can make a dramatic difference to your everyday life the babyzen yoyo is proof of that yes reader i have one having decided that pushing heavy cumbersome pushchairs up various local hills was actually making me feel exhausted and downtrodden it has come as a surprise just how altered my psyche has been by this change i feel lighter freer more like my prebaby self the city streets feel less like an army assault course to be navigated its totally liberating the best design always is whats working im so grateful to all the readers who recommended which baby books to get with his christmas vouchers peck peck peck i want my hat back and little owls bedtime are already firm favourites but emma dodds me is the one winning the biggest smiles this kid just loves a baby penguin whats not i wont go into what weve been dealing with this week as you may be eating breakfast but lets just say that infant antibiotics necessary though they are have had some rather dramatic

for the past three and a half years ive been as jeremy hunt would have it economically inactive which is to say i birthed two babies in relatively quick succession looked at the cost of childcare k a year for a baby and a twoyearold in my part of london towards which the government will contribute up to k a child under the taxfree childcare scheme and decided that staying home made more sense than putting them in nursery and desperately trying to earn enough to break even im far from alone in that calculation current data suggests theres roughly million stayathome parents in the uk although the percentage of dads is increasing the vast majority are mothers according to the department for educations childcare and early years survey of parents about half would prefer to do some paid work if childcare were more affordable on the flip side the thinktank civitas has estimated there are more than million mums of young children whod prefer to reduce their hours but work out of financial necessity what could better exemplify the damned if you do damned if you dont vibe that seems to characterise every aspect of modern parenting personally id like to work ideally just evenings and weekends to begin with to avoid my entire income disappearing on childcare costs and potentially fulltime once my oldest starts school since the term after she turned three shes been eligible for some funded nursery hours but the subsidy doesnt stretch as far as you may think the muchtouted hours of free childcare for working parents is termtime only so over a full year it averages out at hours a week factor in travel and thats less than half of what you need to hold down a fulltime job i want to work because the extra income would be helpful because evening work feels more realistic now my youngest is sleeping better and if im honest because im aware of the prevailing belief that the way i currently spend my days is basically valueless as my household is not in receipt of universal credit ill be spared a chiding letter from hunt urging me to put down the wet wipes and do something more useful it seems unlikely those letters will do much to achieve their official goal usefully deflects blame for the catastrophe that is the british economy from themselves say what you want about nadhim zahawi but the man is undeniably economically active though middleclass stayathome mums are excluded from the official government shaming campaign cultural stereotypes of nonworking mothers are pretty similar across the board from the glossy gymbunny wives of ceos and bankers to young single mums in social housing in the eyes of many were just different varieties of parasite and if anything attitudes towards stayathome dads may be even more negative due to lingering gendered assumptions i could try to persuade you that actually looking after small children seven days a week is quite fullon i could talk about the social isolation about the intensity of always always being needed about the guilt at feeling touched out and not being able to divide myself in two when theyre vying for my attention whats the point though id effectively be begging you to consider childrearing a valuable activity when all evidence suggests that as a society we simply dont just look at how the professionals are treated fulltime nursery care for two underthrees doesnt cost more than median takehome earnings because childcare workers are living high on the hog early years provision is expensive because to provide safe quality care you need a high ratio of staff to kids the only way to make it affordable while compensating workers fairly is to massively expand government subsidies labours proposal to expand the hours funding to underthrees is a step in the right direction but it wont help all families even with that extra support it would still cost to send two kids to my local nursery full time about threequarters of takehome pay if you earn the national median salary k and have a student loan on repayment plan one childcare struggles aside another issue for parents hoping to return to work is that our confidence tends to be at rock bottom i basically dont believe that anyone will want to hire me when friends send me job listings or suggest possible career pivots i suspect them of humouring me some days i doubt that i have any marketable skills whatsoever of course you could argue thats an unusually healthy level of selfawareness for someone with a background mainly in opinion writing but i know far more accomplished women whove taken a few years away from the workplace to raise children and suffer similar selfdoubt to some extent its unavoidably going to be daunting searching for work after a significant break but widespread cultural disdain for stayathome parents does not help when research suggests that even women who might have children are discriminated against in job interviews what chance does someone who has demonstrably prioritised childrearing have i know that many people do successfully return to work after a stint at home albeit often in a more junior and lowerpaid role but im struggling to believe ill pull it off myself instead of targeting partners of universal credit recipients with nagging letters perhaps hunt could send all stayathome parents a good luck card abi wilkinson is a londonbased

most parents with young children would delay having another due to nursery costs that are already forcing some to cut down on essentials according to new research released amid growing calls for sweeping reforms to childcare with the chancellor jeremy hunt looking at measures that could reduce childcare costs which are some of the most expensive in the world prominent providers are to hand a joint letter to downing street demanding action on increasing state help improving care standards and creating a simpler system of assistance for new parents a survey of parents with children under four commissioned by the group found that would delay having or not have another child due to high childcare costs almost half said their childcare provider had increased their fees in the past six months while also said they were cutting down on essentials such as groceries to afford childcare costs of the parents surveyed said they would work more if childcare were available for free treasury insiders accept that childcare costs are one factor keeping some people out of the labour market however the option of extending hours of free childcare to one and twoyearolds in england at the spring budget has been rejected on cost grounds the plan would cost about bn roughly equivalent to a p increase in the income tax rate officials are examining cheaper options one idea already making its way through parliament would see workers given the legal right to ask for flexible working from their first day on a job currently employees only qualify for that right after six months officials believe extending that right to the moment someone starts a job could encourage new parents back into work at an earlier stage a group including the national day nurseries association ndna the london early years foundation leyf and the fatherhood institute have all signed a letter to rishi sunak calling for radical change and warning reforms to childcare have been deprioritised they warned not taking action would have a devastating impact on families and the economy the uk is the thirdmost expensive country for childcare according to the most recent oecd figures they wrote the proportion of wages spent by british parents compared to french parents is more than double its not uncommon for parents especially in london and the southeast to actually spend most of their income on childcare in parents face a steep increase in nursery costs as government funding is falling in real terms while staffing and energy bill costs are rising the patchy nature of the childcare system means parents also struggle to understand all the support available to them while free childcare up to hours per week is only available universally for children aged three and four in england this leaves an unjustifiable gap in support from the end of parental leave the observer has already highlighted concerns from childcare providers that they are struggling with higher food costs even as many report more children arriving to their settings hungry some have turned to charities to help provide food in their settings june osullivan the leyfs chief executive said its shocking how drastic underfunding by the government is driving the cost of childcare up and the quality of service down across many nursery providers this is particularly disgraceful given it impacts even more on children from disadvantaged backgrounds rajan lakhani from the money app plum which oversaw the research said there was a very real risk that many parents will be forced to work less or even drop out of the workforce altogether as childcare fees become unaffordable a department for education spokesperson said we recognise that families and early years providers across the country are facing financial pressures thats why we have spent more than bn over the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare the number of places available in england has also remained broadly stable since

childcare is not a domestic problem or a womens problem its an economic problem this was the subtext of a recent announcement from the confederation of british industry which has called on the government to extend free childcare to relieve labour shortages the treasury is now considering a huge expansion in free childcare hours as part of its attempt to get more people into work senior tories have pressured jeremy hunt ahead of the chancellors spring statement to cut the costs of childcare which are among the highest in europe reducing these costs and providing more childcare hours is essential but focusing only on its benefits to employment would be a missed opportunity the current system is based on a byzantine set of policies twoyearolds from lowincome families are entitled to weekly hours of free childcare most children aged three to four with two working parents get free hours parents can also access up to a year per child by paying money into an account topped up by the government almost twothirds of takehome pay can be spent on putting a twoyearold in nursery even parents on higher salaries are justifiably angry but the situation is worse for poorer families working parents on universal credit can get up to of childcare costs reimbursed but this is paid in arrears forcing some into a cycle of debt nurseries also charge extra fees that can be prohibitively expensive its no wonder that many lowincome families dont use formal childcare at all so far the governments only proposal for fixing the system has come from liz truss who pledged to slash the ratio of nursery staff to children rishi sunak was right to quietly ditch the idea he should now go further the governments funding of free hours falls far behind the real cost of childcare as a result nurseries have made up the shortfall elsewhere to stay afloat subsidising funded hours by slashing wages and charging steep fees to parents with children under two pay is so low that nursery staff are taking jobs in supermarkets while the number of early years staff with qualifications equivalent to alevel fell from in to in raising pay across the sector should be an immediate priority the quality of early years education is pivotal to childrens development it can reduce inequalities that would otherwise persist in adulthood the achievement gap between disadvantaged and wealthy children is already significant at the age of five over the last decade the conservatives have increased the number of free childcare hours but this gap has not shrunk expanding the number of free hours without

the treasury is considering a proposal to massively expand free childcare to one and twoyearolds in england in a move that would cost billions at the spring budget department for education officials have submitted a plan for a free hoursaweek entitlement for working parents of children aged nine months to three years after being asked to work up options by the treasury other options include offering a smaller number of free hours for twoyearolds an offer of free hours for disadvantaged oneyearolds and adjusting the ratios for childcare providers to allow adults to look after more children it comes after labour signalled it would make a transformational offer to parents at the next election with the shadow education secretary bridget phillipson pledging a modern childcare system that works from the end of parental leave until the end of primary school the confederation of british industry cbi has also called for billions to be spent on extra free childcare and reform of the system while a group of influential tory backbenchers led by siobhan baillie is pushing hunt to cut childcare costs at next months budget the current free provision in england is hours a week for working parents of threeyearolds unless one parent earns more than a year while provision for twoyearolds is limited to free hours a week for those whose parents claim some benefits schemes are funded and set up differently in scotland wales and northern ireland the treasury requested the work from other departments as part of its drive to get more people into employment including young people new parents and the recently retired the department for education is understood to be feeding into the inactivity package of proposals being undertaken by the department for work and pensions labour market changes are likely to form the centrepiece of the spring budget however there are already worries within the treasury about the probable bn to bn price tag of a big childcare offer with one source saying jeremy hunt the chancellor was concerned about cost and would be unlikely to approve such a big offer one treasury source said a big expansion of free hour a week entitlement was the most expensive of a long list of options being looked at and it was difficult to see that amount of money being committed other ideas include reducing the universal credit taper rate which could be another option to incentivise employment if the childcare proposals prove too expensive another option under consideration to help with childcare costs is a drive to make it much easier to register as a childminder as these are the majority of provisions currently closing rather than nurseries and accounting for a shortage of places there could also be a campaign to make parents more aware of the option of using childminders not just nurseries on the proposal to massively expand free childcare robin walker the conservative chair of the education select committee said if this proposal has been put forward the treasury should definitely look very carefully at it and they should consider how much money it will save in the long term through increased economic activity rather than just how much it will cost upfront while some tory mps have been pushing for childcare changes others keen on tax cuts are likely to worry about the price tag at a time when they would rather see the tax burden reduced it comes after labour set out its intention to transform childcare if it wins power with phillipson saying parents are being held back by a childcare system that just doesnt work the party has signalled it is prepared to make big changes with the first step being universal free breakfast clubs for every primary school child in england labour has also said it will enable councils to open new maintained nursery provision where they have the capacity a labour source said an expansion of hours without reforming our broken childcare system will not deliver for families or grow our economy an offer of additional hours is a waste of time if it doesnt deliver more childcare places and higher standards we currently have vast childcare deserts where there is no adequate private sector provision to deliver the existing system of hours which providers will deliver these new hours when families cant access available childcare as it is pressure for reform of the childcare system is not just coming from the opposition but business groups too the cbi said this week that the government should funnel billions of pounds into free childcare to help get more parents into work to tackle acute workforce shortages the group said the government urgently needed to announce extra funding and changes to childcare and early years support arguing that a more accessible and affordable system was an immediate economic priority the lobby group which represents more than businesses across the country said as much as bn of investment was required to improve the system and expand free childcare to one and twoyearolds hunts spring budget comes as ministers review options for increasing participation in the workforce after an exodus of missing workers since the covid pandemic official figures show almost million workingage adults are economically inactive neither in work nor looking for a job including men and women who are caring for family studies suggest inadequate access to childcare prevents about million women from taking on more hours equating to more than bn in lost economic output each year and exacerbating cost of living challenges the former prime minister liz truss last month urged rishi sunak not to ditch her proposals on childcare changes including plans to scrap mandatory staffchild ratios in nurseries and increasing funding by hours a week however she faced opposition over the ratio plan amid concerns over the quality of care while business leaders are understood to favour increased funding a department for education spokesperson said we recognise that families and early years providers across the country are facing financial pressures and we are currently looking into options to improve the cost flexibility and availability of childcare we have spent more than bn over the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare and the number of places available in england has remained stable since with thousands of

a week after my th birthday i became a grandmother of course i was forewarned id had the full nine months to prepare but sometimes the knowledge of whats to come isnt quite enough my son and his partner are a tightknit pair theyve known each other seven years or so much of that time spent under my roof they now live in the next house along a fiveminute walk away through lush hinterland country a forgiving distance for fledgling adults my first surprise was the announcement but my second was their enthusiasm the pregnancy had been unplanned but they were elated they were to be young parents though not quite as young as i had been i am easily anxious but careful not to let my anxiety lead my sons adolescence had been a trial he liked to take risks he wasnt wilfully selfdestructive but joyful and hedonistic a pleasureseekingmachine my past was littered with catastrophic losses id become attuned to disaster my son trusted he would always land on his feet the battle between us had been mammoth me you must stay safe at all times him i will not be dictated to by your past trauma it was i admit a battle i lost i forced my anxiety into the back seat it had been a gruelling lesson but my son had taught me not to let fear be the driver sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads and so it was through the pregnancy my son and his partner blooming with love and hope and excitement and me next door keeping my anxiety quiet knowing my son had been right before and he could be right again when i first met my sons partner she was so pretty i turned away so as not to

babies both my births were a horror show how will i know how to help frightened i ask a friend what i need to do and she tells me they just want your grounded energy that is all you are being asked to bring it is odd to see myself reflected in these words grounded energy i know what this means my job is to leave my anxiety at the door once summoned i drive to the hospital my sons partner had laboured calmly through the night at home and they arrive at the hospital around midday i meet them there the atmosphere in the birthing suite is festive my son is already flying high look how far they have come they are so close his partner is steady quiet internal but astonishingly relaxed they have prepared snacks of all kinds in ziplock bags she has several plastic binders of information about things that might help aromatherapy particular positions music massage pressure points i flick through the binders trying to find my feet my son is timing contractions the assigned midwife drops in occasionally to check obs i settle on pressure points which are supposed to keep the labour progressing i move between points one near her ankle one on her hand and press i press so hard im worried it will bruise she shakes off my concerns the pain she is managing so different in scale she is having a baby my sons partner is so quiet its hard for the midwife to tell if the labour is progressing shes quiet i say but i think theres a lot happening inside and i feel it somehow an awareness that there is great movement occurring unseen she announces that she wishes to shower she wishes to shower alone she leaves the door ajar and we are left the midwife my son and i listening in this liminal space wondering what will come next my sons partner shouts from the shower a complaint about the lack of hot water but her tone is sharp angry fierce the midwifes ears prick i think shes transitioning she gets in the bath and we know she is close the fast pace has taken the midwives by surprise and a gang of them come in to bear witness my son hovers near her serious now deeply alert he hands me her phone and says take pictures she is so calm so serene it is making me weep i snap pictures through tears she gives birth like a dancer utterly poised she gives birth like it is a dance she already knows i have seen nothing like it in my lifetime the baby lies directly on her body halfsubmerged eyes open wide dark and luminous my son beams with pride with exhilaration but he is not surprised he does not say see mum see how sweet life can be but i am taking note there is no catastrophe i try to sink into the moment pure wild joy my son his partner their baby i crouch down to welcome her and she gazes unblinking at my face a sudden rush of love a granddaughter jessie cole is the author of

i had firsthand experience of the residential care system for children in the s and worked with children in care in a number of settings until i retired in witnessing changes including the privatisation started in the thatcher era initially good childcare workers set up homes to provide needsled services without local authority bureaucracy as venture capitalists saw profits to be made and assets to be stripped they moved in by buying many small providers and establishing new homes in areas with cheap labour and property there have been previous promises from government like those coming in the wake of josh macalisters report children to be housed closer to family in overhaul of englands social care system february if driven from the centre they will meet the fate of previous initiatives a teenage girl attending a local college from a home about miles from her family was informed that a new policy meant she had to move back into her home area i was her advocate at her case review her social worker supported by the supposed independent reviewing officer who arrived in the social workers car asked why she did not want to return and was told there were strong personal reasons but she did not want to confide these to her social worker the next day the young woman telephoned me because her social worker was coming in two days time to collect her and take her to her home area i advised her to email a letter to the director of social services copied to the national inspectorate thankfully this worked where children in care need to live depends on their circumstances and while most should be near to their home area some will opt to move away and start afresh one size does not fit all roy grimwood market drayton shropshire the governments response to the macalister review of childrens social care in england is little more than a procrastinating postit note on which someone has scribbled low priority no further action sadly this matches the experience of those children and families receiving social care as well as the staff working in the childcare sector they are seen as an inconvenient nuisance unworthy of proper care attention or investment they all know that the governments offer of m to run pathfinder projects is a diversionary tactic to avoid undertaking the bn overhaul of the entire child social care system the macalister

my daughter was born after an epic hour labour and emergency csection i was in total shock from the birthing process and subsequently the bond i assumed would be there from birth wasnt i found myself grieving my prebaby life and dealing with the guilt that followed the days passed by with agonising slowness and i filled my time with endless social media scrolling which only fuelled the disconnect between online and reallife motherhood if it wasnt for the reminder from the community nurse about joining a parents group i would have completely missed the opportunity my mum had told me about the importance of going to a parents group and how finding other parents with babies at the same stage was salient to my motherhood journey its not that i didnt believe her but i already had friends and while ive always loved a chat the idea of parents group sounded a bit naff with awkward interactions and a sprinkling of judgment i feared from other parents nevertheless i confirmed my attendance happy to have an activity to fill the long day tired and wired i made my way to a little room next to the kindergarten up the road i sat my daughter on my knee quietly proud she was able to hold her head up at just six weeks old as i smiled and looked around the room a kind mum pointed at my baby and whispered i think shes just thrown up on herself it was at that moment i realised i hadnt brought any supplies with me my confidence evaporated and i found myself holding back tears as i accepted a cloth from another mum after a bumbling first session from our wellmeaning but spacey maternal child health nurse i began dreading the walk back home and the malaise of an afternoon of solo parenting as mums and babies trickled out of the room with friendly smiles and see you next weeks i struck up a conversation with another mother kristen didnt seem to be in as much of a hurry as everyone else with her sleepy baby lying quietly in her pram while mine squirmed and frowned in my arms as we walked in the hot january sun and i nervously prattled on about astrology her interest in the topic calmed me and we bonded over our daughters mutual scorpio signs as we approached her house kristen invited me into her airconditioned haven and i eagerly accepted in the following weeks kristen and i met up almost every day with our infant daughters at cafes and in our homes we shared our life stories commiserated over sleepless nights and lamented the mental load that tends to weigh more heavily on women in hetero relationships kristens easy nature was either a cause or effect of her babys calmness whereas i felt constantly flustered and underprepared with my baby preferring random minute catnaps and needed to be constantly held fighting the urge to compare i tried to take on some of kristens relaxed nature which helped one day when i visited and her overtired baby was resisting a nap i offered to try and get her baby down for a sleep and channelled the calm i had been observing while kristen made herself a muchneeded coffee and watched my daughter entertain herself with the play gym i successfully coaxed her baby to sleep in the evenings as i prepared to leave kristens house her partner would call on his way home from work when shed tell him i was there he would say i just assumed it warmed my newmum heart to feel i was becoming a part of their routine as much as they were of mine our girls became as comfortable in each others company as sisters first teeth were cut first words were spoken and what started as a friendship of circumstance became the most rewarding relationship in my early motherhood journey when kristens maternity leave ended and our lazy days of companionship were replaced by organised catchups i reflected on the first year of my childs life i

i am staring at the wall i hold in my hand a drill a screw and a wall plug my son has brought his own toy tool set with him too and has been sawing the bed the floor and my legs to help if he were really trying to ape my technique he would have brought a toy phone for i have prepared for this task by watching youtube specifically videos designed for people who like me have spent their lives avoiding basic diy as if it were illegal these youtubers are real men manly men men who thankfully speak to me about basic diy in that affectionate tone you might use if you found an unaccompanied child weeping in a shopping centre lets get this wall drilled shall we they chuckle as i dab my face with a rapidly dampening sleeve come on now no tears well get this all sorted out together my son produces a plastic spirit level and uses it like a hammer his toy hammer is in his baby sisters mouth causing her to retch slightly which she seems to find pleasing i continue watching kind men rattle off commandments about masonry versus wood walls tapping the surface and judging it by the sound dunkkk vs diunkkk as if theyre a master tracker from a jungle survival movie deducing via smell that some elk came through here two days past both sound similar to me especially over the retching and neither is like the one im getting from my own wall so i decide its wood there are injunctions to stay away from electrical wiring i make a note to develop xray vision to avoid this then come the basics re bits and screws and i spot that the settings on their drills are slightly different from my own they seem certain you need to get this stuff exact but i can already feel my brain deliberately ignoring this and hoping i can just wing it this is in so many ways the exact nexus of my problem i have formed a perfectly poisonous combination of horror and complacency toward my own ignorance i avoid doing almost any diy task because i know how clueless i am and yet on those rare rare occasions i do give it a go i immediately assume im a diy savant and carry the job out as quickly and carelessly as possible i fail and fail and fail until some cruel satire of diy has been achieved two prints hung nearly straight surrounded by a constellation of surplus holes a shelf that is definitely up but at a degree angle i tell myself i find not just safe but jaunty and pleasing i take pride in my wonky labours and quietly vow to never try anything like this again this however is a simple job and i am a manly man a dad i have prepared my children are watching i raise my drill to the task and find it silent batterys dead i shout downstairs to my wife two whole weeks ago i did my best and who can do more besides once youtube tells me where to find my charger ill be set did ye hear mammy

lemn sissay the poet and broadcaster has launched a bruising attack on the childrens commissioner for england accusing her of failing to champion children in care at a crucial time and smothering the voice of her own office sissay whose bestselling memoir my name is why was a reflection on his own childhood in care tweeted that rachel de souza a former headteacher and advocate of academy schools appointed to the role by boris johnson in was producing so much fudge i could set up a stall he said i cant be the only one who has noticed the curated muffle from the commissioners office when it comes to children in care this week charities and councils said the governments strategy for overhauling childrens social care launched on thursday did not go far enough in tackling a system that is too often failing vulnerable children and families and whose costs are spiralling out of control sissay told the guardian that the childrens commissioner should be championing children in care in the corridors of power but was falling far short he is adamant that the macalister review of childrens social care and the public inquiry into child sexual abuse both published last year represent a onceinalifetime opportunity to really change things for the children who are the most vulnerable and that de souza should be pushing ministers to do much more de souzas predecessor anne longfield became increasingly vociferous towards the end of her tenure about the need for urgent reform of a childrens social care system on the edge of a precipice warning that thousands of vulnerable children were falling through the gaps into the hands of criminals in an unflinching speech in she challenged ministers to do more than just apply sticking plasters sissay fears de souza is undermining longfields campaign a spokesperson for her office insisted this week that she was wholly focused on continuing to advocate for vulnerable children and especially those in care in a broadly supportive statement about the new social care strategy this week de souza called for more focus and ambition from ministers and warned that the governments plans did not tackle the needs of unaccompanied asylumseeking children often left to fend for themselves in hotels about which i have made multiple representations to the home office the spokesperson added we have made more than visits to settings accommodating children often at weekends and unannounced so that we hear from the children that no one else is listening to but some experts and charities working with children in care backed up sissays concerns zenna hopson a former chair of ofsted who now consults on education tweeted you are not alone in noticing this jane collins the director of the notforprofit foster support and a member of the childrens social care watch alliance campaign group welcomed sissays comments saying she had been disappointed with de souza whom she described as a clearly political choice she should have been more vocal about children staying in care until she said she should have been vocal about unaccompanied asylum seekers when concerns were raised last year but she wasnt and now thousands are missing delma hughes the founder of siblings together a charity that has reunited more than groups of brothers and sisters split up when they were placed in care said last week she launched a report on siblings who are forced to live apart its such a big issue for kids in care and we are the only uk charity doing this but shockingly she hasnt even talked to us ivor frank a member of the child sexual abuse inquiry panel said the office of childrens commissioner had never had enough power and children in care needed to be represented by a special minister in government he pointed out that

ministers are to pledge that children taken into care in england will be placed close to their family and friends rather than being housed hundreds of miles away under what is described as an ambitious overhaul of the struggling social services system the commitment on care placements is one of a series of proposals aimed at reforming what the government has acknowledged is a childrens social care system too often failing to meet the needs of vulnerable families and children it will also promise earlier help for families in crisis strengthened local child protection teams improvements in young peoples experience of the care system and plans to tackle chronic staff shortages of childrens social workers the wideranging strategy to be published on thursday is its response to the governmentcommissioned macalister review of childrens social care published last year which concluded that urgent changes were needed to transform a financially unsustainable system spiralling rapidly out of control ministers will also outline plans to try to curb the excess profits earned by private childrens residential home providers which have been criticised by councils and regulators for charging excessive fees in some cases as much as a week while often failing to meet the needs of the children they look after the minister for children families and wellbeing claire coutinho said children in care deserve the same love and stability as everyone else yet weve seen from the two tragic murders of arthur labinjohughes and star hobson that more needs to be done to protect our most vulnerable children the reviews author josh macalister welcomed the direction of change but said the governments proposals did not go far enough without a whole system reset on the scale set out by the review outcomes for children and families will remain stubbornly poor more children will grow up in care and costs will continue to spiral he said the governments plan gets us started down the right path but it must go further and faster if it is to reach the tipping point of change that children need the macalister review had recommended a fiveyear bn plan to tackle a longrunning crisis that it said the government had failed to get a grip on and that if unchecked would lead to children in care within a decade up from currently at an additional cost of billions of pounds a year however ministers will pledge to invest just m over the next two years with many of the proposed reforms being tested out in a series of pathfinder projects run in a handful of local authorities rather than being rolled out immediately the government will reject the reviews recommendation that it levy a windfall tax on what macalister had called the indefensible profits of private care providers the heads of council childrens services recently described private childrens home operators and their private equity fund backers as rapacious however it will give the green light for local authorities to form regional coops to try to give them more leverage to drive down fees and to source more care locally shortages of residential care in many parts of england mean thousands of children are placed up to miles away from their home authority the government will say it wants to put familylike placements at the heart of the care system and proposes to provide more support for kinship care arrangements where a child unable to be looked after by its parents will be placed with a relative or close family friend up to local authorities will test a new family help service based in schools made up of social workers mental health practitioners and domestic abuse workers this will provide intensive support to thousands of children and families with the aim of tackling issues before they spiral into more complex and acute problems the local government association described the proposals as a longterm approach that would not tackle the crisis currently faced by childrens social care or meet the urgent need for immediate action cathy ashley the chief executive of the family rights group charity welcomed the wider aims of the review but said the measures and the funding proposed fell alarmingly short of the scale of the crisis that is gripping childrens social care kathy evans the chief executive of children england said there may be more in the detail weve yet to see but on first reading even though some are to be welcomed these measures are no match for the scale of action or funding needed to fix childrens social care munira wilson the liberal democrats education and children spokesperson said the independent review of childrens social care said that more than bn is needed over four years to plug the gap this response ducks the big decisions and

when i was secretary of labor years ago one major goal was to crack down on companies that employed children in violation of the fair labor standards act of i remember being horrified to discover that even in the early s children who should have been in school were working often in dangerous jobs we made progress child labor declined in the united states but it was a hard slog by law the highest fines i could levy against companies that put children to work were relatively small some firms treated them as costs of business other businesses dragged their feet the us chamber of commerce and other corporate lobbying groups argued that almost any minimum standard of decency at work whether barring child labor setting a minimum wage or requiring employers to install safety equipment was an intrusion on the socalled free market and therefore a job killer my argument was that the nations goal was not just more jobs it was more good jobs safe jobs jobs that allowed kids to go to school jobs that upheld minimum standards of decency in the years since then ive assumed that progress was continuing on eliminating child labor in america sadly i was wrong serious child labor violations are once again on the rise including in hazardous meatpacking and manufacturing jobs children are working with chemicals and dangerous equipment they are also working night shifts in just the last year the number of children employed in violation of child labor laws increased according to the economic policy institute you might think that in the face of this mounting problem lawmakers around the country would rush to protect these children youd be wrong in fact state legislatures are rushing in the opposite direction seeking to weaken child labor protections this month after young children were found working at a factory owned by arkansass secondlargest private employer tyson foods the republican governor sarah huckabee sanders signed legislation making it easier for companies to employ children eliminating a requirement that children under get a state work permit before being employed in the past two years states have introduced or passed legislation expanding work hours for children lifting restrictions on hazardous occupations for children allowing children to work in locations that serve alcohol and lowering the state minimum wage for minors already in bills to weaken child labor protections have been introduced in iowa minnesota missouri nebraska ohio and south dakota one bill introduced in minnesota would allow and yearolds to work on construction sites across the country were seeing a coordinated effort by business lobbyists and republican legislators to roll back federal and state regulations to protect children from abuse regulations that had been in place for decades why is this going on now four reasons since the surge in postpandemic consumer demand employers have been having difficulty finding the workers they need at the wages employers are willing to pay rather than pay more employers are exploiting children and state lawmakers who are dependent on those employers such as tyson for campaign donations have been willing to let them a second reason is that the children who are being exploited are considered to be them rather than us disproportionately poor black hispanic and immigrant so the moral shame of subjecting our children to inhumane working conditions when they ought to be in school is quietly avoided while lawmakers and voters look the other way third some of these children or their parents are undocumented they dare not speak out they need the money this makes them vulnerable and easily exploited finally we are witnessing across america a resurgence of cruel capitalism a form of social darwinism in which business lobbyists and lawmakers justify their actions by arguing that they are not exploiting the weak and vulnerable but rather providing jobs for those who need them and would otherwise go hungry or homeless conveniently these same business lobbyists and lawmakers are among the first to claim we cant afford stronger safety nets that would provide these children with safe housing and adequate nutrition yet when it comes to handouts from the government in the form of tax loopholes subsidies and bailouts these same business lobbyists and lawmakers claim that the nation can easily afford them and that businesses need and deserve them obviously the department of labor needs more inspectors and authority to levy higher fines but thats not all thats needed america seems to be lurching backward to the gilded age of the late th century when workers including young children were treated like cow dung and robber barons ruled the roost the public must demand that child labor once again

by the time children start school in the uk those from lowincome backgrounds are already an average of four months behind their peers in terms of educational development the gap only widens from there by the end of primary school its nine months by the time they take their gcses months inequality grows exponentially throughout childhood gaining momentum with every year a child gets older thats why it has been so refreshing to see childcare and the early years firmly back on the political agenda since the spring budget but interventions in the early years of a childs life may already be too late we know that inequality starts much earlier than nursery it starts in the womb from the moment they are born babies in lowincome families are more likely to have a medically low birth weight and be born prematurely tragically theyre also more likely to die within days of birth inequalities are established well before children even qualify for the chancellors free childcare this has longterm consequences babies born small or early are more likely to have health problems in later life premature babies start nursery and school weeks or months younger than their peers putting them at an educational disadvantage from the start poor health at birth has a ripple effect culminating in poorer adult health and lower adult earnings the postwar welfare state was founded on the principle of providing a safety net from cradle to grave today policies to support children still typically start at birth but should they we know that the cradle is too late to tackle some of these inequalities that start in the womb could interventions during pregnancy be the answer some countries are beginning to consider this in italy introduced a new universal child allowance that starts in the seventh month of pregnancy in the us the mitt romney campaign has called for the child tax credit to be paid to pregnant women my research published this week in the journal of health economics shows that health inequalities starting at birth could be tackled by a simple lowcost intervention starting child benefit payments during pregnancy the evidence that this works does not come from another country but from the uk where we did this in all but name for a short period between and the last labour government shortly before the end of its term in office introduced the health in pregnancy grant a universal cash transfer equivalent to three months of child benefit a lump sum of was given to all pregnant women who visited their gp or midwife in the third trimester of pregnancy my research shows that this relatively small sum led to significant improvements in babies health average birth weight increased while the proportion of babies born prematurely fell the biggest winners were lowincome young mums on mumsnet women reported using the in a range of ways to reduce stress and promote wellbeing whether by reducing their overdrafts covering large expenses like pushchairs or investing in antenatal swimming classes this evidence wasnt available at the time and the policy fell victim to austerity scrapped just two years after it was introduced on the grounds that it was a gimmick that would be spent on booze fags bingo or plasma screen televisions universal cash with few strings attached was seen as a risk rather than an opportunity we now know that it wasnt a gimmick starting child benefits in pregnancy should instead be seen as a lowcost effective option for any chancellor looking to tackle inequality and boost economic growth small early interventions have ripple effects that can reduce inequality in the long run this makes them highly costeffective my research indicates that the health in pregnancy grant will increase lifetime earnings for the babies who benefited from it by three times more than the cost of the policy similarly recent institute for fiscal studies research has shown that sure start which provided universal parenting support preschool and antenatal advice in childrens centres across the country saved m of nhs spending by improving childrens health investing in the health of future generations means better labour market outcomes more growth and more tax revenue for governments to spend elsewhere a little invested early on goes a long way looking back at which policies worked in the past can help us innovate in the future by building on the principle of cradle to grave and updating it given what we know now we can make progress on inequality over the last decade the gap in birth weight between different social classes has

i sat our three primaryaged children down the other day and told them actually thats not true i didnt even try to sit them down but i did catch their attention when they all happened to be in our kitchenliving area at various stages of getting ready for school so no the kids werent all sitting quietly looking up at me with large attentive eyes but at least i wasnt as im prone to do at times yelling through the house once i had their attention or at least some of it i told them i needed their help not just help but theirs i didnt go so far as to say i wasnt coping with the pace of life but that was the gist i warned them my brain was behaving like a sieve that my inbox and calendar were out of control that even if the school sent me three important reminders about this or that and even if i read them all i most likely would not that would be no guarantee i would remember what i was supposed to when i was supposed to i cant remember if i added that their dad was also unable to cope with the tsunami long story short i was absolving us from full responsibility for school reminders times three and giving some to them dont get me wrong i love my childrens school and the time its teachers take to keep parents in the loop im not against reminders or newsletters or updates or fyis id certainly prefer too much communication than too little im just not well keeping up with all of it right now and once it occurred to me that maybe right now i cant it made sense to take a breath explain and ask for help the problem is we live in an age where its just as easy for someone to contact people as it is for them to contact one where theres no limit on how many demands can be made on us because all it takes is a click of a button to make them at the same time there are no more hours in a day we can upgrade the hard drives on our computers we can improve their memory their capacity their speed but we cant upgrade our bodies or our brains we can only be in one place at one time sometimes emailed information is nice to know but its not information i need to know and i neednt feel guilty if i dont have time to process and action all of it sometimes i am the person who needs to know something but sometimes im actually not sometimes the little person it concerns can take responsibility themselves and often that little person is better equipped to remember library day and cupcake day and freedress day than i am because they might actually care and they might remember on their own their brains are at a stage where they can absorb entire languages with ease while i struggle to remember peoples names also theyre at a stage in life where they only really have to manage themselves theyre not facing requests and demands and expectations from what seems like all directions all the time they have capacity that i do not i think of myself as being naturally quite diligent and not very rebellious sometimes the fact i could not do something ive been asked to do or expect myself to do doesnt even occur to me even if the request or expectation is unreasonable im also prone to feeling guilty even or especially over the smallest things but the more i think about it the more important my sanity is for me and for my family preserving it by lowering expectations of how much i can manage my own and other peoples shouldnt induce guilt perhaps you have more than three children andor more than you can manage in the time you have each day perhaps you also need to stop attempting the impossible and ask for help im yet to determine how effective downward delegating will be but im hopeful after talking to the kids i asked them if they understood they said they did time will tell but whats the worst that can happen school uniform on a freedress day no money for a cupcake stall reading the same library book two weeks in a row it could be worse emma wilkins is a tasmanian journalist and freelance writer,2023-03,sat three primaryaged child day told actually thats true didnt even try sit catch attention happened kitchenliving area various stage getting ready school kid werent sitting quietly looking large attentive eye least wasnt im prone time yelling house

likely would would guarantee would remember wa supposed wa supposed cant remember added dad wa also unable cope tsunami long story short wa absolving u full responsibility school reminder time three giving dont get wrong love childrens school time teacher take keep parent loop im reminder newsletter update fyis id certainly prefer much communication little im well keeping right occurred maybe

its no secret that australians are having fewer children the latest abs statistics reveal our fertility rate was well below the socalled replacement rate needed to keep the population growing the last time our fertility rate was this low we started literally paying people to have babies all official predictions are that the number of babies will only decrease in the years to come its not that weve suddenly gotten over babies three quarters of australian women and of men aged either have or want children but women thankfully have an increasing ability to choose when and if they have them four out of five sexually active heterosexual women aged in australia are using contraception for most women having a child whether planned or not is now an active choice but child rearing as an active decision raises its own set of questions and challenges is it feasible responsible if not now when almost three quarters of people without children say that being able to afford to support a child is an important consideration in their decision and theyre right having children is one of the most expensive things one can do lets start with conceiving and giving birth if necessary an ivf cycle costs around and its not unusual to do more than one if you want to use a private hospital your health cover needs to include pregnancy and birthrelated services for at least months beforehand that means roughly an extra on premiums before giving birth thats before the thousands of dollars out of pocket sign up for guardian australias free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup then theres the pram the bassinet or cot and the car seat some of these you might be able to pick up secondhand but disposable nappies cost around cents each that doesnt sound like much until you consider eight nappy changes a day for two years thats on nappies around families experience nappy stress you could switch to cloth but then you need to grapple with a higher upfront cost all that laundry and of course the value of your time starting to sound like a crappy financial proposition it gets more expensive still suppose the parents go back to work to pay for all these costs an hour of childcare costs on average thats almost one third of median hourly pay while childcare subsidies cover some of this most parents still face outofpocket costs if your child is sent home sick youll need to take the day off work and still pay the fees talk about adding insult to injury even once children go to school the costs continue back in researchers estimated that it would cost a lowincome household around per week to raise a sixyearold girl in respondents to a suncorp survey reported spending over per week on food alone for one child parenthood brings more than just explicit costs being a parent can mean you earn less both immediately after birth and in the long term it can also hurt career progression the parenthood penalty is especially pronounced for women there are costs too to the budget in taxpayers spent over billion on family assistance and close to billion on childcare subsidies thats not to mention the costs of schools and higher education so yes having children is expensive to individuals households and economies does this mean we should stop making babies is a lower fertility rate actually a cause for celebration from a purely economic perspective the answer is no population growth is one of three things that drive gdp growth given that australias fertility rate is below the replacement rate most econocrats would love to see more people displaying a sense of national duty and asking what they can ahem do for their country thankfully in australia the choice to have children isnt a decision made by governments ultimately deciding whether to have children is and should be a choice made by people individuals and couples who face their own unique costs and benefits circumstances and preferences its no wonder that our tax and welfare system aims to sweeten the deal and nudge us in the direction of having kids but if policymakers want a bigger australia they could and should do more for those who want to have kids increased incentives or lower

have you ever wanted to go into politics well i have good news for you anyone can be a politician because were all born with the innate skills to succeed in the field the evidence for this is in our toddlers we were all toddlers once and all toddlers are born with a similar skill set to politicians allow me to break it down toddlers will lie to your face theyll be eating the chocolate while telling you theyre not eating the chocolate huge rings of sticky brown sugary goodness around their mouths even as they shake their heads chocolate no they can be standing on the floor looking you straight in the eye broken shards of porcelain around their feet swearing black and blue they didnt break a plate of course it wasnt them theyll scream pleading ignorance theyll even place the blame on someone else usually a sibling or a pet theyll look at the sky and swear it is green even as they point at the varying shades of blue toddlers go back on their promises catch them in a lie theyll swear theyll never lie ever again ever for the rest of their life spoiler they will find them sticking their finger in a powerpoint explain to them the serious danger that awaits theyll swear to never do it again spoiler they will agree to get them a slushie if they make that nights bedtime routine that night nice and easy no whinging no crying they promise they swear that bedtime will be easy as pie spoiler it wont be in fact it will be pointedly worse because of the aforementioned slushie consumption they change allegiances at the drop of a hat like all of the worlds greatest predators they can sense weakness and they seize upon it to achieve their ambitions they can sniff out the winning team and wont hesitate to align themselves with the frontrunner if one parent is more likely to buckle and cave in to pizza for dinner theyre going to be right there offering cuddles and kisses to seal the deal if one parent is so tired theyre not likely to put up a fight but instead dole out candy to shut everyone up theyll amp up the volume to a frequency only dogs can hear factional boundaries are no barrier to anyone here toddlers will sit in a mess of their own making and then cry and want you to feel sorry for them tell them repeatedly not to run with their milkshake they ignore you and run when they trip and cause the inevitable milkshake spillage they will expect you to tell them its all going to be ok and perhaps even buy them a new one even though you repeatedly told them that running with the milkshake was an exceedingly bad idea toddlers are hypocrites one day theyll be telling you off for swearing the next minute theyll be swearing like a pirate when youre eating an icecream theyll tell you sharing is caring so they can have a slurp but when you want them to share anything with their sibling the answer is no sharing is not caring sharing is coercion if they think they have caught you in a lie even if it relates to an undertaking you never actually made they will scream bloody murder but then take a reread of point no catch those little dictators in a lie and try to pin them down i dare you what youll get is a form of utter magic an explanation will ensue that is so long so rambling so many twists and turns so many clarifications and corrections by the time it reaches its painful end you will have already moved on because really who has time for that the original issue is long forgotten until the next time of course there are politicians who dont display the behaviours outlined here but how many politicians you know without at least some of

from the cradle to the grave once that phrase was a description of the ambition of the welfare state now it is an illustration of how far that old vision has frayed an illustration too of the extent to which inequality shapes peoples lives from the beginning to the end often with the aid of policymakers two weeks ago in the budget the chancellor jeremy hunt made a big show about the expansion of childcare promising bn to extend the current policy of hours a week free nursery care for overthrees to one and twoyearolds too critics soon pointed out that while the offer was welcome the numbers did not add up nursery funding has been cut by in real terms since the government provides only twothirds of the cost of free childcare for three and fouryearolds nurseries make up the difference by ramping up charges for younger children now that such crosssubsiding wont be possible there is fear that many could go out of business more insidiously what hunt did not tell parliament but was revealed by the guardian last week is that parents on benefits will effectively be forced back into work under new rules parents in receipt of universal credit can be docked benefits if they are not available for work up to hours a week once their youngest child turns three or if they dont meet a job coach every three months once their child turns one and monthly when the child is two they will be forced to work even if their partner is employed but has their wages topped up with universal credit in other words if your partner is forced to work for such poverty wages that they have to be augmented by benefits then you too must work generally also for poverty wages the childcare may ostensibly be free but it comes at considerable cost for many of the poorest in the land decent childcare should not be simply about getting people into work it is an essential aspect of womens rights nevertheless expanding childcare to make it easier for parents to work is good forcing parents into work is atrocious what it suggests is that the childcare provisions in the budget seem as much about the broader drive to use welfare as a punitive measure as they are about helping parents the irony is that there is considerable evidence not just that sanctions dont work but that they help sustain a flexible labour market of lowpaid parttime jobs it is a policy that entrenches poverty and inequality at the other end of life too the question of state benefits has become the focus of intense debate and not just in britain ageing populations lengthening lifespans and constrained budgets have all helped create political turmoil throughout advanced economies over the question of pensions and generated public anger most notably in france where president emmanuel macrons attempt to raise retirement age to has led to widespread protest and disorder and to the postponement of a royal visit to be able to retire at may seem a wonderful prospect to most britons in a country in which the state pension age currently stands at this is due to rise to after the government had been considering bringing this forward to between and that possibility has however now been shelved not because of public protest or violence on the streets but for shallower political and deeper social reasons partly the government was worried about the optics of announcing that ordinary people would be expected to work even longer when the budget had relaxed tax rules on pensions for the exceptionally wealthy the governments change of mind is driven however also by a more morbid reason when the state pension age review was published in it was estimated that life expectancy for men at age would be about years in and over years by the figures for women were slightly higher at and years respectively now however those estimates have fallen by between one and two years for both men and women the pandemic has played its part in this decline the problem of life expectancy in britain has though deeper roots and is best seen not in absolute but in relative terms a paper published last week in the journal of the royal society of medicine shows that while life expectancy in england has increased over the past years between and it rose by about years both for men and women britain has also tumbled down the international league table coming out of the second world war britons were among the most longlived peoples in the world the uk standing th in the global ranking in and rising to eighth a decade later by however it had tumbled to th place of the g group of advanced industrial nations the only one to fall further than the uk is america there were two periods of particularly sharp falls the first was during the s when thatcherism ensured the greatest rise in inequality in the postwar period the second was the s the decade of austerity one reason why the overall increase in life expectancy has been so sluggish in the uk the authors observe is that in recent years it has fallen for poorer groups between and the average lifespan of men in the most deprived areas of england was estimated to be almost years less than those in the least deprived areas for women the gap was almost eight years as for healthy life expectancy an estimate of lifetime spent in very good or good health the difference between the poorest and richest areas was about years both for men and women almost two decades of life lost to inequality the welfare state today barely functions as a welfare state it responds to inequality but also fuels inequality it has become framed by the appeal to rationalise resources and coerce the poor rather than by the desire to enable people to live more flourishing lives from the beginning of life to the end there is something rotten in the way we think of welfare

so i had this baby in lockdown i mentioned it i think this fabulous boy sort of oniony looking divine he grew gently and without much fuss evolving over the next two years into a kind of bernie sanderstype gentle fair tender made a lot of sense when you thought about it the tenderness has been a big thing he likes sometimes to very gently stroke my cheek and solemnly gaze and has gone through phases of identifying strongly with mice which is why his recent change into a child who screams until hes red at the suggestion that he say might put a jacket on has felt particularly galling this is not my first tantrum rodeo my daughter too found her voice to use the parlance of the parenting books at a similar age a voice she continues to find most evenings and some mornings too but while i might have spent the minutes she was screaming harriedly panicking today i use the time to rock quietly on the floor nearby and distract myself with the news which is where i was when i read about jeremy hunts plan for a bn boost for childcare in england it sounded good it sounded like he had listened to the charity pregnant then screwed who recently reported that threequarters of mothers who pay for childcare say it doesnt make financial sense for them to work but then the screaming cut through again and i wondered what this boost would actually look like stella creasy the walthamstow mp who has been campaigning sometimes with her baby in her arms to show that childcare is an intrinsic part of a functioning productive economy has likened hunts plan to help to buy the housing scheme that pushed demand with no supply sending prices soaring she points out that the only way the government will be able to fulfil their promise to next year provide hours a week of childcare for working parents of children aged from nine months is by scrapping the stafftochild ratios which currently stand at one adult for every three children under the age of two and i know these people are professionals experts angels and far better than i am at coping with a room of people who barely come up to your hip only eat plain pasta and have the willpower of an olympian athlete but still still i would not wish a week in charge of five twoyearolds on anybody however saintly the tenderness i like the reading frog and toad is good the playing i endure but the nappies feeding negotiating cleaning avoiding injuries and deaths the tantrums not for me and to times that by five the collective noun for a group of hungry twoyearolds cannot be written down as it exists only as heat and noise a low gargling howl its a massive relief that childcare is on the political agenda when i was returning to work after having my first child and reeling at the reality of childcare in a country where its more expensive than any other developed nation a friend took me aside she explained wearily why the gender pay gap remains and the financial penalty from motherhood and advised that i do whatever i could to stay in work if only so that when my child was of school age i didnt have to start again from the bottom i remember how shocking i found it then and honestly it still shocks me today the clarity the shame the ripping away of choice future ambition agency so the spring budget feels positive hopeful even women will be able to work but the confederation of british industry estimates that rather than bn as promised the governments plans will cost almost bn joeli brearley of pregnant then screwed says free childcare from nine months is brilliant but only if there are childcare settings to be able to access this care without the correct funding there wont be nurseries will have to close and increasing ratios will lead to burnout in carers unable to cope with a whole gaggle of toddlers especially and with persistent apologies if one of them is mine if the structures including proper pay for those carers arent in place to uphold the new plan the whole thing will tumble potentially making the situation even worse than it already is for the parents for the nursery staff and for the children whose care and education in their first days has a massive impact on their longterm health when i first encountered a tantrum that was not my own i did my research the nhs has a whole bit on its website including a list of things to do try holding them firmly until it passes and find a distraction and dont bite back but whats really helped ive found this time round is finding a kind of rational calmness and sanity that for me comes from work from having somewhere else to go in the day and somewhere else to go in my head beyond survival or ambition the importance of work in upholding a self is crucial for a parent if only to allow them to breathe through the next

childrens social services bosses have launched an outspoken attack on the governments illegal migration bill warning it could lead to thousands of youngsters in care running away into the arms of traffickers and criminals the association of directors of childrens services adcs in england said the proposed legislation undermined existing laws that protect children and contradicted the governments own vision for children in care stable homes built on love outlined last month if implemented the bill will irreversibly distort the care system the care system is not nor should it be a holding mechanism for the immigration system said steve crocker the adcs president he added when a child first comes into our care our primary focus is to find them a permanent stable home as set out in statute we cannot carry out this essential work if they are to be removed as soon as they turn years old despite having care leaving rights and entitlements up to years the un convention on the rights of the child states that in all actions concerning children the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration sadly this bill is a clear step away from over years of custom and practice in this country he added all children in this country irrespective of where they were born have the right to a safe and nurturing environment the bill proposes to detain and deport asylum seekers who arrive in the uk by irregular means in small boats or in the back of lorries unaccompanied children will be deported when they turn the refugee council estimates children will be affected in the first three years if the bill becomes law the adcs said the statement reflected the serious concerns of local authority childrens services heads about the damaging effect the bill would have on children who had arrived in the uk having fled desperate situations by law councils have a duty to safeguard all children in their care and ensure their needs are met under the children act for example they are required to secure permanence for children in care this would be impossible if as the bill proposes children covered by the act are deported on their th birthday this cohort of migrant children would in effect become part of a twotier care system in which they had fewer care rights than their contemporaries it was likely to create an incentive for children to run away before they turn into the arms of exploiters and traffickers to avoid being returned to their home country crocker said he added the lack of permanency would create unintended safeguarding risks for unaccompanied minors in local authority care and children who are detained with their family in home office accommodation for whom it was not clear where safeguarding responsibilities lay crocker said the bill ran counter to the governments own vision for children in care set out with great fanfare in february in its response to the independent review of childrens care the childrens care minister claire coutinho said at the time youngsters in care deserve the same love and stability as everyone else and that more needed to be done to protect our most vulnerable children a home office spokesperson said we recognise the particular vulnerability of children who are often forced into making lifethreatening journeys to the uk which are being facilitated by criminal gangs who have little regard for their safety unaccompanied children who arrive in the uk illegally will be provided with the necessary accommodation and support but they will not be able to settle in the uk once they turn taking these measures will send a clear message that children cannot be exploited and forced into crossing the channel in small boats for the purpose of starting a new life in the uk the only way to come to the uk for protection will be through safe and legal routes this will take power out of the hands of the criminal gangs and protect vulnerable people including

a generation of parents on benefits will be pushed into nearfulltime work when their children turn three in a significant shift in government policy the guardian has learned charities and academics criticised the move as unconscionable saying it devalues unpaid care and would disproportionately affect single mothers driving families into debt and vulnerable children into poverty in a sweeping change which was quietly introduced by jeremy hunts budget last week but which the chancellor did not spell out in his speech to parliament hundreds of thousands of parents who rely on universal credit will be discouraged from providing daytoday care for their children the changes to be introduced this financial year apply to parents who are the familys lead carer the vast majority of whom are women the government says it could dock benefits unless parents are available for work up to hours a week once their youngest child turns three nearly double the current requirement of hours meet with a job coach every three months up from every six months as soon as their child turns one parents of twoyearolds will have to attend coaching monthly seek employment if their partner is in paid work but their wages are topped up with universal credit these individuals previously had no obligation to work a leading expert on benefits sanctions said the changes amounted to a major shift in policy this appears to mean that many if not all of the current parental easements on universal credit will be scrapped entirely said david webster of glasgow university its a complete disregard of childrens needs and will have drastic effects on lone parents the measures are being introduced as ministers cast about for ways of tackling labour shortages caused by brexit long waits for routine nhs procedures and an exodus of older workers since the pandemic while hunt did not set out the detail of the reforms in his budget speech he did signal his determination to use benefits sanctions to drive parents into more paid work independence is always better than dependence which is why we believe those who can work should the chancellor said so sanctions will be applied more rigorously to those who fail to meet strict worksearch requirements or choose not to take up a reasonable job offer the policy appears to signal a change in how the welfare state values parenting the benefits system has previously recognised the importance of unpaid work undertaken by parents who are lead carers by allowing them to spend more time at home compared with other claimants kate andersen a york university academic who has extensively researched womens experience of welfare said the move was in the wrong direction it is out of sync with what low income mums and parents want it devalues unpaid care and says that your primary societal contribution is paid work she added in total ministers estimate these measures combined could impact about parents or carers about people with young children nearly of whom are women will face a greater risk of sanction according to estimates from the work foundation maryann stephenson the director of the womens budget group said the move would disproportionately affect single parents of whom are mothers women are the shock absorbers of poverty putting further financial pressures on this group at this time during the cost of living crisis is unconscionable under the changes parents who are the main carer will be expected to work hours a week from when their youngest celebrates their third birthday this is just under the hours the government considers as fulltime employment currently parents of three and fouryearolds are expected to work for hours while parents of five to yearolds are expected to work for hours new parents on universal credit will also be expected to prepare for work by meeting with a job coach every three months instead of every six months when their child turns one parents of twoyearolds will have to attend meetings every month the changes according to the department for work and pensions are designed to align benefits with hunts early childcare offering which will result in those on universal credit being able to reclaim more childcare costs and have their claims paid upfront parents who fail to meet the requirements will face the prospect of benefit sanctions having their payments docked latest figures show individuals across the uk received a sanction in the year to october the average penalty was about the dwp said claimants had to be available for work which usually means any paid work at national minimum wage on a fulltime basis a spokesperson said in some circumstances where that was not reasonable it could be limited adding that the hours of work required was a maximum and could be tailored however andersen said her research showed there was minimal tailoring of benefit conditions to mothers personal circumstances its not true it is tailored to personal circumstances the mums were saying this aspect needs to be much more realistic she added campaigners say conditionality forces claimants to take unsuitable and lowpaid jobs and ends up penalising parents already on or below the breadline there are concerns jobcentre staff lack expertise and that employers cannot meet the demand for more flexible hours mothers of young children say they often struggle to attend work coaching because of the cost of traveling to appointments and the complications of juggling childcare ben harrison the director of the work foundation thinktank at lancaster university said the new requirements were a really significant step up adding that research indicates sanctions impoverish claimants and damage mental health even employers themselves say pushing people to take any job regardless of whether it is suitable to an individuals skills or ambitions is not helpful and can actually end up causing more issues for organisations than it solves he said becca lyon the head of child poverty at save the children uk said the move risked making children poorer she added that the charity was particularly concerned about new requirements for the parents of toddlers to meet a job coach every month unless jobcentres start making provision for childcare so parents can easily attend appointments with a toddler in tow we expect there to be a lot of missed meetings a government spokesperson said work was the best way to get on adding that a single adult on meanstested benefits would be better off by more than in fulltime work on the national living wage under plans proposed in the budget childcare payments for those on universal credit will increase and be paid upfront instead of in arrears the requirements any claimant is asked to meet will be clearly set out in their claimant commitment and work coaches will support claimants by understanding their individual circumstances including caring responsibilities and helping them into work,2023-03,generation parent

the governments claims that there are enough childcare places in england are meaningless as councils collect little to no information on whether provision meets local demand experts have said local authorities are responsible for ensuring that the provision of childcare is sufficient to meet the requirements of parents in their area under section of the childcare act in february the minister for children claire coutinho said in a parliamentary written answer the department has regular contact with each local authority in england and if a local authority raises concerns about sufficiency issues we will support it with any specific requirements at present all local authorities report that they are fulfilling their duty to ensure sufficient childcare but data obtained by the early years alliance shows that only of local councils in england collect data on the proportion of parents who are able to access the childcare they need last week the chancellor jeremy hunt announced a change to the way childcare would be funded confirming a bn expansion of support from and announced an ambition for all state primaries to provide childcare before and after lessons from pitched as part of a wider drive to help people into work and boost growth the plan will provide an extra hours a week during term time to parents of children from the age of nine months to two years matching the existing offering for three and fouryearolds campaigners say more knowledge is needed about how many facilities are able to offer local services and where the gaps are which leave parents unable to find nurseries childminders and other support when they need it the early years alliance data obtained via freedom of information also shows of local authorities gather information on whether parents can access childcare on the times and dates they want and only one in of the local councils collect the same information for children with special educational needs or disabilities this lack of knowledge of the state of the childcare and earlyyears system meant any government claims of sufficient places are utterly meaningless in practical terms neil leitch the alliances chief executive said if youre a parent who say needs a nursery preschool or childminding place for four days a week but can only secure one day a week and its at a setting minutes away then constant assurances from government that all is fine are understandably going to ring completely hollow and this is exactly the sort of situation that families up and down the country are currently facing a separate analysis by the childrens charity coram also shows gaps in the knowledge of childcare provision in some local authorities in england more than half of the councils did not have data on whether they had sufficient places to meet the afterschool childcare needs of parents with children aged to years olds almost of the councils could not say whether they had enough provision to support parents working atypical hours and around a third did not answer the question on sufficiency for disabled children or parents who needed afterschool care for children aged five to joeli brearley the founder of the campaign group pregnant then screwed said we need to see a strong commitment from the government to rebuilding the sector sustainably if we are to increase the number of parents in work unfortunately the amount of money pledged to fund the free hours entitlement is nowhere near enough and so there is a strong possibility that we may lose even more nurseries as a result a government spokesperson said ofsteds latest figures show that the number of childcare places available to families in england has remained broadly stable since and standards remain high with of providers rated good or outstanding we will continue to monitor the sufficiency of childcare places and stay in close contact with local authorities on our transformational uplift in the hourly funding rate to providers,2023-03,government claim

my mother hates sentimentality of any sort but especially the mandated socially coordinated kind christmas yuck families halloween american consumerist trash dont get her started on jubilees and coronations and none more than mothers day the coarse schmaltz of its message which to save her being a little bit sick in her mouth ill just summarise as youve been ok i guess and i dont hate you when i was a kid i bought her a brass vase in a junk shop and stole some tulips from a neighbours garden id never put my hand in my own pocket to buy anyone a present before and i was so excited by my ingenuity and largesse that i sounded her out in advance how did she feel about flowers hate cut flowers flowers should be in the ground purple ones even purple ones what if youve stolen them its better if you dont steal what about an intricately carved probably by a factory brass vase well if you dont like cut flowers she said archly then you dont have very much need for a vase someone had to intervene quietly and say shes bought you a mothers day present you idiot she still wants to see us on mothers day she just doesnt want any presents but its a bit more complicated than that anything you can eat is fine fudge cheese unless it has hallmark overtones chocolates wine is acceptable so long as it isnt fizzy a card is ok but only if youve made it and her quality control is extremely exacting which is bold for someone with such poor eyesight family dynamics stay constant for a really long time and then the next generation comes along and they change fast a lot so my sister and i both had our eldest children there her yearold daughter my yearold son and all the pool balls were shooting off each other in directions we did not plan nothing delights my mother more than when our children are sarcastic to us she sees it as cosmic payback but as sisters we revert to our own adolescent dynamic so the kids are in this upside down world where theyre rewarded for sarcasm and the typically castiron motheraunt union has been completely destroyed as we squabble over whose turn it is to put the knives and forks out my niece had drawn an extremely intricate portrait of her grandmothers cat which my mother peered at for a really long time before concluding that looks nothing like mimi she sounded affronted as if her granddaughter had deliberately caught the cat at a bad angle and immortalised it in pen and ink the cat has no bad angles its a cat this went in with a bullet to her top leastgracious responses of all time along with the occasion when she told my other niece that her origami looked like a vagina and the time when she told my son that his card was so inept so lacking in depth of perspective shed assumed id done it from the cats and indeed my mothers point of view all this was a sideshow to the main drama which was the quest to get mimi to take a steroid it was vitally important because shed taken one the day before and if a cat goes cold turkey something terrible happens to their personalities nobody knows what but its like the infected in the last of us apparently i said maybe mash it in pat and my mum said what kind of pat as if the battle for the cats soul would be fought on that slice of terrain between ardche and ardennes and i said whatever they have in sainsburys local meanwhile my sister magicked up a jar of hare paste it appealed to the cat and the mission was accomplished why have i got hare paste my mum asked it was a my sister really didnt have an option except to speak very quietly its a present oh our mum said then a

my son clutches his tupperware container he is dressed in an aran knit strikes mean we escaped world book day and find ourselves at an altogether more amenable replacement journey day in which each member of the class wears national dress and brings food from their own culture id heard of such things before specifically the time my nephew donncha had been tasked with the same resulting in a now legendary photo of him beaming at his tottenham school gates sporting an irish rugby shirt and a potato the size of his own head alas we could not repeat this shot as our heritage food offering was mandated to be bread limiting things to bread seemed oddly specific and started me worrying about those children in my sons class whose countries or cultures do not feature bread as a cornerstone of their diet i neednt have worried as an hour on google confirmed and with a degree of certitude that seemed suspicious for such a strong claim that there is not a country on earth which does not eat bread as some part of their culinary tradition or does not have a bread of their own our contribution was soda bread made with flour baking soda salt and buttermilk topped with irish butter which my

when news broke on the eve of the budget that the tories were going to announce a massive expansion of free childcare i literally spilled the milk that i was carefully divvying up into baby bottles that mistake would cost me dearly because the main job of a parent i have learned is to heat things up in order to cool them down food baths enthusiasm etc it soon became apparent that this was the chancellors job too every kid in england will be offered hours of free childcare from the end of parental leave until school age so far so so good except it wont be for every child but mostly the ones who havent yet been conceived or at least wont require a nursery place until after the general election it wont include my kids either because our second child turned out to be two children twins oddly we didnt have to spare each year so my partner now looks after them fulltime her economic inactivity means we wont be eligible for free childcare because both parents have to be in work to benefit but heres the real kicker for your counting app the government will pay a rate for childcare places that doesnt cover the actual cost which could drive providers out of business so its not really clear why or how anyone would deliver them mega lols all of this puts labour in a rather unfortunate position not for the first time the tories have stolen an idea that they were hoping to make into a wedge issue in truth they actually stole the idea from the womens equality party wep as labour did too but the big difference is that we dont care in fact we actively encourage it at our first election outing we sent a copy of our manifesto to all the old parties wrapped in a ribbon with a note that read please steal me among the pages of transformative policy ideas was one that stood out universal free childcare i dont want to victimblame but i have little sympathy for labour when it comes to this particular theft bridget phillipson labours education spokesperson has been given endless column inches to talk up her partys flagship childcare policy without ever having to say what it actually is if you are going to trade in empty promises theres always a chance that your opposition will too and yes i do understand how election campaigns work having run several for labour and wep and that you dont reveal all your best ideas until one has actually been called but thats not why labour is holding back on this and very many other important issues it has fallen into the trap of being so focused on winning the election that it is in danger of forgetting the point of doing so you dont win elections by trying not to offend anyone the pollster politics that is dominating labour hq is a road to onlysofar its the same logic that leads you to believe that manifestos have to be carefully costed spreadsheets stresstested over and over in focus groups rather than a vision for the world we want to live in labour is so afraid of criticism about magic money trees when it sets out spending plans that it is parroting the madeup economics of having to balance the books by simply taking a few more public services out of our shopping basket as if the treasury were an amazon account the most frustrating thing about all this is that childcare is one of the best counterexamples we have to the neoliberal economics destroying our country the more you spend on earlyyears education the greater the returns for everyone modelling from the womens budget group shows that if you offer hours to all kids from the age of six months and pay earlyyears workers a real living wage the treasury would recoup between and of costs because more parents would be able to work and pay taxes and fewer would claim outofwork benefits the policy very nearly pays for itself instead of proudly shouting this from the rooftops labour is now stuck with the very situation it was trying to avoid it has to convince voters not just that childcare is worth voting for but that it is worth properly investing in which is exactly what they should have done in the first place conventional wisdom would have us believe that there is no use crying over spilt milk but unless labour

signup payments for new childminders will do little to address a crisis in the sector that has seen existing professionals leaving in droves experts say as the number of childminders in england reaches its lowest level in a decade there were childminders registered as of december according to ofsted data the lowest number since and down from the more than at the end of dwindling incomes in the midst of a cost of living crisis rising stress levels and increasingly complex needs of families are all leading to the exodus coupled with not enough new childminders joining the workforce to replace those leaving jeremy hunt the chancellor this week announced a bn expansion of the governments funded childcare offer to provide an extra hours a week in term time for children from the age of nine months to two years this included the piloting of incentive payments of for new childminders rising to for those joining through an agency neil leitch ceo of the early years alliance welcomed the governments recognition of the decline in childminders but criticised paltry signup payments as unhelpful childminders who contacted the guardian also spoke of the prohibitively high cost of setting up suggesting that was putting off others from joining their ranks rather than putting all their energy into attracting new childminders into the sector ministers would do well to prioritise retaining the thousands of existing professionals who we know are leaving in their droves leitch said megan jarvie head of coram family and childcare said that while it was helpful to see recognition of the need for investment to enlarge the sector yesterdays proposals will not help experienced childminders to stay childminders represent only of total childcare places according to data from the department for education but are essential for parents needing flexibility and those needing wraparound afterschool care the number of registered childminders has decreased year on year but this has accelerated with an annual fall in and overall childcare providers have fallen by in three years with almost fewer providers registered at the end of the number of registered places for children under seven has however marginally increased by from m in to in data from the department for education shows the increase has mainly come from private and voluntary providers the main reason for the reduction in registered childminders is that fewer are joining the sector than leaving with only new registrations in the year ending august the lowest number of annual joiners to date yok a childminder and mother of three from welling southeast london will stop operating in two years once her youngest child goes to school i started childminding in because i needed to work and care for my son it was the best option to do both there was a heap of coursework safeguarding and first aid training and getting my home insured an interview by phone after a fivehour ofsted inspection of my home i had to do another interview it was nerveracking but i was over the moon when they accepted me she said its lovely seeing children grow up in your care but i struggle with late payments your home doesnt feel like a home because of protocols ofsted audits endless paperwork and housework then there are the late pickups the funding portal you have to use to get paid is crazy especially my first year was so overwhelming like yok many childminders took up the job because they could not afford childcare for their own children and left when their last child started school or were planning to do so when i had my firstborn i was a manager in a restaurant if i had put him into nursery id have been left with a weekly profit of only she said if nurseries had been cheaper i would definitely have gone back to work instead childminders gave various reasons for having or wanting to leave but these commonly included low pay increasing workloads long hours dealing with admin ofsted inspections insufficient funding of the governments free childcare offer and rising costs especially for food and energy tina a childminder from west sussex qualified less than three years ago but is now closing as rising costs have made childminding financially unviable i love my job but unfortunately the government funding is just not covering the increasing costs of all my outgoings she said nurseries in her area that had offered the funded or hours of childcare she said were now no longer doing so to limit losses caused by underfunding childminders tend to be cheaper than private and notforprofit nurseries although the gap has widened in recent years in the average hourly cost of a childminder for children aged four and under was below the hourly charge in a nursery and an increase from the gap in the prices in according to data from the dfe sylvia wood a veteran childminder from manchester is one of many who reported huge demand for her services childminders are often cheaper than nurseries which unlike childminders are allowed to charge parents topup fees for consumables and activities to make up the governments funding shortfall im turning people away on a weekly basis i charge a day some nurseries here are charging upwards of she said an ofsted spokesperson said that while the requirements for training and the other regulations are set by government were working hard

in his budget statement the chancellor said in there was barely any free childcare for underfives a conservativeled government changed that why would someone respected for their integrity and decency be prepared to tell such an untruth i asked myself this question after listening to that part of jeremy hunts speech relating to the initiative on childcare and his interviews the following morning in broadcast interviews he then went on to claim that this was the greatest investment in his lifetime bearing in mind of course that in the coming year this will amount to m and future expenditure will depend entirely on recruiting a workforce to deliver muchneeded improvement much needed because of the devastation caused over the last years including the demolition of the sure start programme pioneered years ago by the late tessa jowell and myself additionally back in as education and employment secretary and with the support of the thenchancellor i introduced the first national nursery education programme for fouryearolds and subsequently threeyearolds fundamentally it would appear that the chancellor does not understand that nursery education is a critical part of the childcare offer for underfives the additional element is of course education which complements the care funded from the public purse finally a budget that mentions childcare but where will these magic nursery places come from jeremy hunt march we have reached rockbottom in terms of political dialogue when someone as respected as mr hunt can distort the truth and seem to believe the words that are coming out of his mouth david blunkett labour house of lords many years ago in coventry at the beginning of my years in education sir keith joseph margaret thatchers then education secretary asked a primary

as the chancellor stood up to deliver his spring budget on wednesday joeli brearley sat in the lobby of a hotel near parliament crouched over her laptop headphones on eyes glued to the screen the founder of pregnant then screwed had read the guardians story about the promise of free hours a week for all children under five the night before but after many leaks and denials she wouldnt let herself hope then after waiting for more than minutes she heard jeremy hunt confirm it i just burst into tears and put a big napkin over my face says brearley who founded the campaign group eight years ago to actually hear him say those words was truly a breathtaking moment under the governments childcare proposals all preschool children in england will receive governmentfunded hours during term time from with an ambition for all state primaries to provide wraparound care from experts have been quick to point out the plans flaws the current free hours provision for three to fouryearolds is underfunded and has caused thousands of providers to shut a promised m increase was far short of the bn needed the bn for the new hours would not meet the bn estimated cost of all free hours by demand already outstrips supply and in a tight labour market badly paid workers are leaving the sector in droves a deeply unpopular policy of increasing the ratio of carers to children to from will go ahead despite opposition and eligibility rules only giving the hours to working parents mean the poorest children will miss out but the announcement was also welcomed as a huge step forward one that a few years ago seemed as likely as a male politician being asked how he juggled work and home life how did it happen the pandemic changed everything says brearley it suddenly became really apparent how important childcare was she says then the cost of living crisis hit and childcare costs which had been rising for years spiralled the impact the number of women leaving the workforce increased for the first time in decades with many saying they worked fewer hours than they wanted parents frustration which had been growing for years burst its banks in october more than parents mainly women protested in towns and cities they filled in surveys vented on social media and wrote to mps you can write the policy papers look at the data and give all the economic arguments in the world says brearley but until people demand change its never going to happen at the same time behind the scenes a wide coalition was forming in july last year the womens budget group pulled together organisations representing parents children unions providers politicians and businesses with the mantra no egos everyone just working together for a better future for early years before the party conferences last year they lobbied hard stella creasy and other labour women created motherred to fund parliamentary candidates who promised to fight for childcare reform then the shadow education secretary bridget phillipson promised that childcare would be her number one priority it established childcare reform as a key election battleground says sarah ronan the childcare lead at the womens budget group we knew then that the government was going to have to do something alongside conservative mps such as siobhan bailey the coalition focused on delivering the message not new not revolutionary that childcare was vital for the economy and that in a tight labour market reform was urgently needed the obr informed ministers that reforms would have a greater impact on gdp in the future than any other fiscal policy measure since and add new workers to the workforce wed been chipping away and it was almost like when youre playing jenga and you finally find that loose block says ronan the labour market and the economy thats how weve been able to get this issue centre stage that is frustrating for one of parliaments longeststanding childcare reform campaigners harriet harman who entered the commons seven months pregnant in when only of mps were women even though childcare was top of womens demands for decades that wasnt enough says harman whose first question to margaret thatcher about the lack of childcare was met with hoots of derision men get what they want women only get stuff if they can argue it works for the economy news also tucked into the budget that the childcare element of universal credit will now be paid upfront was bittersweet for nichola salvato who no longer needs it in january she challenged the policy and won and she was part of a campaign by a group called mums on a mission backed by save the children but the dwp fought the decision and successfully appealed before making a uturn the year before a general election its so frustrating it was such a waste of public money to defend our case for so long she says it is fantastic news and will make a huge difference to so many families its just such a shame its taken them so long deep disquiet remains in the early years sector where the decision on ratios has infuriated providers and left many feeling shut out of discussions the early years alliance eya spent two years fighting for the release of information that showed the government had been knowingly underfunding the current free hours policy at the expense of providers a fact tacitly acknowledged by hunt as he promised a funding increase but the eyas chief executive neil leitch argues that the m extra does not plug a bn hole this is not a strategic vision that gives us security for the long term its a soundbite he says and until there is some substance behind it i have every right to hold some reservations on friday after a week of high drama long hours and little sleep brearley was preparing to give evidence about childcare to parliament next week her euphoria had worn off but her optimism remained i know that what has been proposed is very imperfect it wont work in its current format and we now need to push for more funding so we can get this right for every parent child and provider she says but we have to recognise that this is a momentous moment whats promised is the bare minimum we cant go back from that we

on hearing that jeremy hunt plans to extend the offer of free childcare hours to children under three many parents will have breathed a collective sigh of relief the prominence of childcare in his budget is evidence of how far opinion has shifted though a vital part of the economy childcare has long been treated as a domestic issue parents have been expected to conjure up an additional salary for the luxury of being able to go to work provision is patchy complicated and ruinously expensive mr hunts recognition of these facts was a welcome change in tone but his offer which would only come into full effect after the next election treats childcare as a means to a single end getting parents into work childcare isnt just an economic growth issue early years education plays a crucial role in targeting inequalities and closing attainment gaps for this reason quality matters as much as availability mr hunt like his predecessors sees childcare primarily as a labour market tool the risk is that simply expanding the number of free hours without reforming the childcare system will drive down quality moreover limiting free hours to families where both parents work will cut out those who could also benefit such as parents who are looking for jobs the government has made bn available to fund this expansion and raise the hourly rate of childcare workers this money which will also cover afterschool clubs is unlikely to stretch far enough the sector has seen its funding cut by in real terms since and already struggles to provide existing free hours for three and fouryearolds research obtained via freedom of information requests shows the subsidy for existing free hours is only twothirds of what the government estimates is needed the answer for many nurseries has been to crosssubsidise free places by charging parents extortionate fees for younger children if those children are also entitled to free hours nurseries wont be able to do this so those that were already struggling may decide to increase the price of unfunded hours or other fees worse some may close thousands of nurseries have already shut mr hunt has pledged to boost the number of nursery places but all that has been announced is a pilot giving childminders a incentive payment in a recent interview he said it was not up to government to calculate the number of nurseries needed because were not stalinist russia but without careful planning particularly for how to retain staff the government may end up pouring money into a system where forprofit providers cream off additional funding and squeeze worker wages under mr hunts proposals the hourly rate for those who work with three and fouryearolds will only increase in line with inflation in an industry where the average salary is about this is small change doubling the number of free hours appears to create a new arm of the welfare state but rather than a beveridgean moment where high quality and affordable childcare is made universally available the result of mr hunts current proposals will be a patchy system more akin to the piecemeal reforms that predated the welfare state without a detailed workforce plan and adequate funding to ensure good outcomes for children particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds these reforms will at best be a missed opportunity and could even make things worse,2023-03,hearing

wednesdays budget announcement represents the largest expansion of free childcare england has ever seen and from a tory government i cant believe that i actually typed that sentence extending the free childcare hours to children aged nine months to two years will cost bn and will the chancellor claims cut families childcare costs by combined with the intention to increase the availability of wraparound care for parents of schoolage children it could be the news that many campaigners and parents have been waiting for when you live in the uk and you start thinking about having a child or are perhaps already pregnant with one there is i think a moment when you look into what the childcare offer is and realise with a sinking heart that between the ages of nine months and three years old youre basically on your own although its often necessary to work fulltime as most modern households require two incomes so unless you have family support youre going to need to pay someone if you wish to return to the workplace and with the second most expensive childcare system in the world and nursery waiting lists that can last years one couple i know just paid upfront for a child that has yet to be conceived but dont worry they refund you if you dont get pregnant good luck this childcare gap has never made any sense politically socially or economically i can remember thinking that i might have to simply give up my job as many women do that there has now been political recognition of the unfairness of this and the burden that it places on mothers is no small thing and it is usually mothers as we all know the financial pressures on families of which my colleague lucy pasharobinson wrote starkly last week wont end but they will be eased significantly in some cases so there is something to celebrate certainly just seeing childcare on the political agenda again feels like a sea change and its ok for parents to feel cautiously optimistic even if they are frustrated about how long the phased introduction of the free hours will take because parents are desperate and struggling now though the measures will not be fully implemented until it seems that some families like mine with a oneyearold will benefit from hours from next spring not that its actually hours just as it isnt actually hours inexplicably the government continues to assume that school holidays shouldnt count despite the fact that most working parents dont get those off so it actually provides hours of free childcare a week for only weeks of the year when you divide the total number of free hours by the number of weeks in the year it isnt quite the offer it initially seems so its important to retain perspective england has not suddenly become finland with its enviable statesubsidised day care system and its willingness to fund parents who want to stay at home to care for their children credit where its due though joeli brearley of pregnant then screwed has been fighting for years for better childcare on behalf of british parents and without her efforts it is unlikely anything would have changed shes not resting on her laurels though this is a significant moment for childcare she tells me after years of campaigning by parents and groups like ours childcare is now top of the agenda for every political party that is absolutely a moment worth celebrating however there are a number of serious issues with the plan reservations include the fact that the funding paid to childcare providers for the free hours is too low which means more nurseries could close their doors a disaster in the making considering there will inevitably be an explosion in demand as sam freedman who coauthored the report delivering a childcare guarantee for the institute for public policy research thinktank explained nurseries subsidise the too low free hourly rate by charging more for one and twoyearolds thus such high prices if one and twoyearolds also get free hours then they cant crosssubsidise you risk a major supply problem research from the confederation of british industry cbi estimates that fully funding the existing schemes for three to fouryearolds and expanding the scheme to one and twoyearolds would cost bn the big question as freedman noted is where these places will come from in a market that is so dysfunctional especially when i suspect we may see a mini baby boom as parents who were wondering how they could ever afford another baby realise that it might just about be doable now for those less well off and single parents the changes to the amount of childcare support universal credit claimants receive and the fact it will be paid upfront and not in arrears are welcome developments that the free offer only applies to households in which all the adults are working though might mean that some children who would really benefit developmentally will miss out the debate around childcare still largely focuses on the difference it can make to parents in terms of their wellbeing and finances which is important but the social and educational benefits to children are often left unarticulated in fact childcare should be a childrens rights issue and we should not be denying those children access to the education system the proposed ratio relaxation which increases the number of twoyearolds in england that each adult can look after in a childcare setting from to as is the case in scotland is unlikely to help children either is it all fur coat and no knickers in some ways yes brearley says most of what was laid out in the chancellors budget is to be implemented after the general election so we dont know who will be in charge of delivering it its a carrot in other words one that looks tasty and shows that politicians are finally waking up to the fact that they desperately need the millennial vote what is so important is that we have changed the conversation the conservative party now acknowledges that childcare is key infrastructure for the economy and extending subsidised schemes to all children from nine months old is massive labour will be forced to beat this policy and so the only way is up though im pleased and the free hours will probably benefit me the tories will never get my vote but then as a friend said they wouldnt get my vote even if jacob reesmogg offered me the free use of his personal nanny on balance however i think id rather entrust my baby to the statefunded childrens centre one of the few that are left after the conservative party closed them down could we possibly have them back by the

jeremy hunt has said he is proving the doubters wrong as he used a stronger than expected economic performance to help fund new tax breaks for business investment and a drive to get people back into the workforce here is our at a glance summary of what was in the budget here is an analysis by the guardians economics editor larry elliott here is an extract to be sure the chancellor will be relieved that the independent office for budget responsibility now thinks the economy will just about avoid the two consecutive quarters of falling output that would denote a technical recession and that growth will be stronger in the likely preelection year of than predicted last november at the time of his autumn statement but doing less badly is not the same as doing well hunt said he was delivering a budget for growth a refrain that has been heard many times by conservative chancellors over the past years the reality is that the uk is battling against three powerful headwinds rising interest rates rising taxes and a cost of living crisis it could certainly do without the added pressure of a credit crunch caused by bank failures despite the chancellors bullish performance living standards are on course for their biggest twoyear fall since the mid s while taxes as a share of national income will be at their highest since the second world war by and here are verdicts on the budget from a guardian panel polly toynbee miatta fahnbulleh katy balls frances ryan louisa britain rebecca longbailey and lucy pasharobinson the institute for fiscal studies says the childcare proposals announced today will create one of the most severe distortions you are ever likely to see within a tax and benefit system that is because the abrupt cutoff means that the generous provision being made available abruptly stops if someone starts earning more than in a briefing the ifs explains a parent with a oneyearold and a threeyearold whose childcare provider charges englands average hourly rate for hours per week would after these reforms find that their disposable income ie earnings net of tax and childcare outgoings falls by if their pretax pay crosses disposable income would not recover its previous level until pretax pay reached meaning a parent earning would be worse off than one earning for those with higher childcare costs the distortions are even more absurd a similar parent paying average london rates for childcare using hours per week would see a fall in disposable income when their pretax earnings cross disposable income would not recover its previous level until pretax pay reached the welsh finance minister rebecca evans said the chancellor made a series of deliberate choices to prioritise petrol and potholes over investment in public services pay and economic growth and suggested he was saving more dramatic announcements for nearer the next general election she said today we saw a less than bare minimum budget which misses the big picture at a time when peoples financial situations are worsening it fell short of providing meaningful support there were sticking plasters when we needed significant action potholes and petrol took precedence over pay rises for teachers and nhs staff the uk government has spent months telling the public sector it cant pay them a pay rise but its spent bn on fuel duty for example there was nothing in this to recognise the pressure on the nhs and nothing for social care which is one of the biggest pressures were facing it does seem the chancellor has more headroom than hes using i would suggest hes looking to make more dramatic announcements bigger handouts closer to the election rather than grappling with the problems right now responding to the chancellors announcement of hours of free childcare for children of working parents aged nine months and over from in england evans said we are already one step ahead in our support for childcare what we do know is its taken us quite a long time to get to the point where the capacity in the sector is able to expand weve invested in the skills in the sector increased the hourly rate and been enabling investment in the physical assets the sector needs the uk government is going to find it needs to invest in that sense to deliver on its pledge it takes time to expand on the sector jeremy hunt said his priority with the budget was growth in its assessment of the impact of the budget policy measures on growth the office for budget responsibility says it has revised its growth forecast upwards more on the basis of the policy measures in this budget than it has done on the basis of policy measures in any previous budget since but that only amounts to growth being higher than it otherwise would have been it says it says relative to our premeasures forecast our central estimate is that these policies taken together increase employment by per cent by but part of the employment impact on potential output is offset by lowerthanaverage hours and earnings among many of the new joiners so the overall impact on gdp is around in this is the largest upward revision we have made to potential output within our fiveyear forecast as a result of fiscal policy decisions taken by a government in any of our forecasts since migration into the uk will settle at a higher level than previously expected the office for budget responsibility says in its new forecasts net migration flows settle at a year rather than the assumed in its november forecast a year ago net migration flows were settling at a larger population due to increased net migration will add to the uks potential output in the fiscal watchdog says the obrs report explains that higher recent rates of inward migration can be attributed to the resumption of international travel following the pandemic especially among foreign students with student visas reaching a record high of in the postbrexit immigration regime that began in and issued visas in its first year of operation only of which were for eu citizens who did not require a visa under the previous regime and other changes including british national overseas visas to hong kong nationals and visas to ukrainian nationals ever since the office for budget responsibility has been saying that brexit would be bad for the economy it has been assuming a drop in imports and exports compared to what would have happened if the uk had not left the eu leading to a fall in productivity over a year period in todays report the obr says that these forecasts are still holding up and that there is nothing in the latest data to suggest it is wrong it says overall while net migration has been higher than we anticipated investment growth has been significantly weaker than we expected before the referendum and our assumption about the impact of brexit on the uks trade intensity is broadly on track as a result we have not revised our view that productivity will be lower in the long run than if the uk had remained in the eu the government was particularly keen to change the pension tax allowance rules because many senior doctors get to the point where once they have reached their pension limit they feel less incentivised to keep working according to itvs political editor robert peston the treasury considered restricting the changes to just doctors but the savings would have been limited he says in his speech jeremy hunt said i am launching the first competition for small modular nuclear reactors it will be completed by the end of this year and if demonstrated as viable we will cofund this exciting new technology in fact this is not the first time a competition of this kind has been proposed in when george osborne was chancellor his spending review and autumn statement proposed an ambitious nuclear research and development programme which would include a competition to identify the best value small modular reactor design for the uk arguably it is just a case of the policy arriving eight years late one of george osbornes boasts as chancellor was that he was able to take low earners out of having to pay any income tax by lifting the basic allowance it was a coalition policy pushed originally by the liberal democrats but then enthusiastically adopted by the tories in their manifesto but in march rishi sunak the then chancellor announced that the allowance and higher rate threshold would be frozen for four years and last autumn jeremy hunt said the freeze would be extended another two years to this means as people get annual pay rises more and more of them clear the hurdle and get sucked into paying basic or higher rate tax economists call it fiscal drag the office for budget responsibility says that by the sixyear allowancethreshold freeze will have brought million people into paying basic rate tax million people into paying higher rate tax and people into paying the additional rate the ifs also says fiscal drag will mean basic rate taxpayers paying an extra in and higher rate taxpayers paying an extra see pm paul johnson director of the institute of fiscal studies has just released his verdict on the budget johnson says it is just as notable what jeremy hunt didnt announce such as no higher pay for public sector workers while freezing fuel duty again there was no funding to be found to improve the pay offer to striking public sector workers where bn might have been enough to make an inflationmatching pay offer possible this coming year thats a political choice money for motorists but not for nurses doctors and teachers big personal tax rises planned for next month via the freezing of income tax thresholds will still go ahead johnson points out that fiscal drag is hitting living standards that will mean an extra in tax for basic rate taxpayers in and an extra for higher rate taxpayers these tax rises may be necessary from a fiscal point of view but they are an important part of the reason why household incomes are still expected to fall more over the current twoyear period than at any point in living memory johnson also points out that hunt has been hemmed in by his own poorly designed fiscal rule to have debt falling at the end of the forecast period and on childcare the ifs says hunts new funding should help tens but not hundreds of thousands of parents into work provided that it is appropriately funded johnson says the big expansion in the childcare offer to families with younger children likely doubling spending on childcare looks like it will take us close to completing a year long journey during which a new arm of the welfare state has been created the scottish government will get another m over the next two years following the chancellors spending increases in england including his pothole fund with arts and communities project getting m dedicated funding in keeping with conservatives postbrexit strategy of spending uk government money in areas controlled by the scottish parliament hunt announced that edinburghs cashstrapped festivals would get m while another m would be shared by five community projects such as aberfeldy sports club and a community grocery shop and cafe in kyle of lochalsh in the highlands jeremy hunts spring budget was less generous for the uks devolved governments than previous westminster budgets with no increases for the biggest spending westminster departments such as health and education that drive treasury bonuses for scotland wales and northern ireland he said scotland would also be offered at least one of the investment zones he plans a proposal likely to challenge the scottish national partyled government in edinburgh to set aside its ideological discomfort about lowtax enclaves john swinney scotlands acting finance secretary said overall the budget was a missed opportunity to combat rising poverty the cost of living crisis and invest in public services he said the limited additional money for the scottish governments budget is welcome but will not go far enough and in the longterm our capital funding will fall in realterms the scottish government is doing what it can with its limited powers to ensure people receive the help they need but the uk government could have done far more to ease the burden affecting so many demonstrating yet again why scotland needs the powers of independence a thinktank has described the changes to the pension tax allowance rules as a massive inheritance tax loophole this is from james browne head of work income and inequality analysis at the tony blair institute and this is from jeevun sandher head of economics at the new economics foundation another thinktank increasing the pension lifetime allowance is a massive giveaway to already very wealthy people if the chancellor hopes this will help older people remain in work its completely divorced from reality only around of workers saved more than the old annual allowance and just were hit by the lifetime limit of million increasing the annual and lifetime allowances wont do much to help the vast majority of us save for retirement one group that are supposed to benefit from these tax changes are the gps and nhs consultants who were forced to retire early due to pension limits but this group is far more affected by the annual than the lifetime allowance which is still far below its level nick macpherson a former permanent secretary at the treasury has also criticised the proposal but the move has been welcomed by the wealth management industry this is from lee clark a financial planner at rbc brewin dolphin an investment management company effective retirement planning is a longterm game that requires longterm consistent pension policy from concurrent governments to reward hard working savers pension savers need certainty not this seesawing of policy for example would a future government reverse this move that said the abolishing of the lta lifetime tax allowance is fantastic news for many professionals that have had a disincentive to work and save because of the frozen lifetime pensions allowance of m that had halved in real terms since inflation isnt actually expected to return to the bank of englands target until as jeremy hunt explained in his budget statement the obr expects the annual inflation rate will fall sharply to by the end of a more rapid decline than expected in november that fall will be partly driven by falling household energy bills but stronger domestically generated price pressures means inflation is expected to oscillate around zero in the middle of the decade back in november the obr had forecast inflation would turn negative the obr adds inflation returns to target in early with the offsetting effects of lower gas prices and increased domestically generated inflation leaving the consumer price level at the end of our forecast little changed from november labour says changing the pension tax relief rules which it describes as the only permanent tax cut in the budget will cost the taxpayer for every person who returns to the labour market the rationale for the move this figure is based on the policy costing more than bn towards the end of the decade see pm and the obr saying in its report that it expects the policy to result in an extra people staying in work the obr says changes to the lifetime allowance and annual allowance on pension contributions increase employment by around by removing some financial disincentives to continuing in employment for those with large pension pots here are the figures from the treasurys red book showing how much the two changes to pension tax allowances will cost the government the lifetime allowance on how much people can save in their pension funds tax free will be abolished and the annual allowance the amount that can be put in the fund tax free will go up from to there is no cost in the column on the left but by and the two final columns on the right it is costing more than bn a year the uks tax burden is on track to hit its highest level since the second world war the obr forecasts that taxes as a share of gdp will hit in news that will not please the taxcutting wing of the conservative party that would be percentage points above where it stood before the pandemic which drove up government spending and borrowing but the obr does point out that the uks tax burden is lower than the average of other advanced economies the corporation tax burden will be the highest since the tax was introduced in by the labour chancellor jim callaghan the obr says as the rate is increasing from to despite opposition from the tory back benches the ratio of public spending to gdp is expected to settle at its highest sustained level since the s the obr has raised its forecast for how far uk house prices will fall from their peak the fiscal watchdog now predicts a drop in prices compared with their high in the fourth quarter of thats one percentage point more than the drop forecast in november when the mortgage market had been rocked by the shambolic minibudget property transactions are expected to drop by relative to their q peak the obr points out that the correction has begun leading indicators from halifax and nationwide suggest that house prices have already fallen by between their peak in the middle of and february low consumer confidence the squeeze on real incomes and the expectation of mortgage rate rises to come are expected to contribute to continued falls in house prices and a reduction in housing market activity according to the office for budget responsibility household disposable income is set to fall by almost in the two years between and the obr says this is an improvement on what it was expecting last autumn it is still the steepest fall since records began more than years ago the obr says real household disposable income rhdi per person a measure of real living standards is expected to fall by a cumulative over the two financial years and while this is percentage points less than forecast in november it would still be the largest twoyear fall since records began in the fall in rhdi per person mainly reflects the rise in the price of energy and other tradeable goods of which the uk is a net importer resulting in inflation being above nominal wage growth this means that real living standards are still lower than their prepandemic levels in the sharp rise in interest rates over the last year means the cost of servicing the uks national debt has also surged interest rate have tripled over the past year across advanced economies the obr forecasts that the share of revenues consumed by uk debt servicing will rise from in to in and hit by that is because much uk government debt is indexlinked meaning that the interest payments received by bondholders goes up and down in line with inflation which hit year highs over last year here are three takes on the budget from paul johnson director of the institute for fiscal studies and of course the most interesting material is often in the office for budget responsibilitys report its economic and fiscal outlook thats here the uk is on track to hit the governments target to have debt falling as a share of the economy by the narrowest of margins in five years time the office for budget responsibility said the obrs economic and fiscal outlook shows that the chancellor only has bn of headroom to achieve the target to have debt falling as a share of gdp in the financial year that is the smallest amount of headroom any chancellor has set aside against his primary fiscal target since the obr was established in by george osborne and that calculation assumes that the government raises fuel duty rates in future years having frozen fuel duty at its current rate for another year today the obr says underlying debt which excludes the bank of england and is the measure targeted by the chancellor does not peak until a year later than we forecast in november at per cent of gdp and then falls only marginally by per cent of gdp in the final year of the forecast that suggests hunt may not have much more firepower for preelection giveaways at future budgets as he has spent around twothirds of the improvement in todays forecasts the treasury has now published all the budget documents on its website here the most important one is the red book but the policy costings and distributional impact analysis is on the website too and here is the treasurys news release with its summary of the measures starmer ends his response by saying this is just sticking plaster politics after years of no growth people are entitled to ask if they are better off than they were before the answer is no he says starmer says the government was right to look at a solution to the pensions problem that means some wellpaid doctors are retiring early but he says the pensions tax allowance announcement is a huge giveaway to some of the wealthiest people in the country he goes on the only permanent tax cut in the budget is for the richest how could that possibly be a priority starmer accuses hunt of lifting ideas from labour he says of course labour welcomes more spending on childcare as tory mps jeer he tells them they were not listening when hunt explained how long it would take to implement starmer makes a joke about the petrol station photocall that rishi sunak staged when he was chancellor telling jeremy hunt that he should use his own car and know how to use a debit card when he promotes the budget and he says he looks forward to promoting the swimming pool policy at least he wont have to borrow one of them as soon as the chancellor sat down the office for budget responsibility released its new assessment of the uk economy the fiscal watchdog confirms that the economic and fiscal outlook has brightened somewhat since its previous forecast in november the nearterm economic downturn is set to be shorter and shallower mediumterm output to be higher and the budget deficit and public debt to be lower but this reverses only part of the costs of the energy crisis which are being felt on top of larger costs from the pandemic and persistent supplyside challenges continue to weigh on future growth prospects the obr says that hunt has spent twothirds of the improvement in the fiscal outlook on todays budget measures such as maintaining the energy price guarantee at a year and on supporting business investment in the near term while boosting labour supply in the medium term the obr adds this lowers inflation this year and more significantly sustainably raises employment and output in the medium term keir starmer is responding to hunt now one of the budget traditions is that the leader of the opposition replies not the shadow chancellor starmer says this is supposed to be a budget for growth but the figures show the economy is set to contract the uk is on a path of managed decline and falling behind its competitors he says he says the tory cupboard is as bad as the salad aisle the lettuce might be out but the turnips are in he says the tories are a divided party caught between a rock of decline and a hard place of their own economic recklessness dressing up stagnation as stability as their expiry date looms ever closer hunt ends with a final childcare announcement he says the government will offer hours of free childcare for every child from the age of nine months where all adults in the household work he says this will reduce childcare costs for families by nearly update hunt said so today i announce that in eligible households where all adults are working at least hours we will introduce hours of free childcare not just for and yearolds but for every single child over the age of months the hours offer will now start from the moment maternity or paternity leave ends its a package worth on average every year for a family with a twoyearold child using hours of childcare every week and reduces their childcare costs by nearly because it is such a large reform we will introduce it in stages to ensure there is enough supply in the market working parents of twoyearolds will be able to access hours of free care from april helping around half a million parents from september that hours will be extended to all children from months up meaning a total of nearly one million parents will be eligible and from september every single working parent of under s will have access to hours free childcare per week hunt says he wants all schools to be able to offer wraparound care from am to pm either on their own or in partnership with other schools he says the ambition is to have this in place by september hunt is now addressing childcare hunt says he will increase funding paid to nurseries by m from this september and rising to m next year that is a increase which is what the sector wanted he says hunt says he is going to increase the annual pensions tax free allowance from to and he says instead of just lifting the lifetime allowance currently just over m he will abolish it thats an unexpected rabbit out of the budget hat there were rumours that the pensions lifetime allowance would be raised to m but its a rabbit that will benefit high earners such as doctors who have long said they have been hit by a pensions trap partly due to the freezing of the lifetime allowance hunt says he want more older people to return to work although as someone aged he prefers the term experienced he says referring to dame eleanor laing who is in the chair as deputy speaker he says madam deputy speaker i say this not to flatter you but older people are the most skilled and experienced people if that was a joke it did not seem to work mps seem to think he was being rude hunt says there will be skills boot camps for people in their s hunt says sanctions will be applied more rigorously to people on benefits who refuse to look for work but the earnings threshold will be increased from hours per week to hours hunt says he will allocate m for mental health and musculoskeletal support occupational health is important to help people back into work and he says there will be a m pilot to help people with special needs transition into the workplace hunt is turning to employment brexit was a vote to change the economic model he says the number of disabled people in work has risen by million he says today the government is publishing a white paper on disability benefits reform the work capability assessment will be abolished disabled people will be able to seek work without fear of losing support he says a new programme called universal support will be set up to help disabled people get into work up to will be spent per person and the scheme could help up to people a year he says he claims this is the biggest change to the welfare system for a decade full capital expensing which jeremy hunt just announced lets businesses deduct the cost of any eligible investment they do from their corporation tax bills straight away rather than over several years full expensing should make it more attractive for a company to invest in a new building or in new machinery without it the firm can only deduct a small fraction of the cost of investment each year over the accounting lifespan of that investment that means that in practice they dont actually get the full cost of the investment as inflation will erode the value of the money firms can claim back in future years so the longer the writeoff time the less of the cost of the investment you can write off as hunt explained it is a corporation tax cut worth an average of bn a year for every year it is in place it will offset the increase in the corporation tax cut from to and replaces the superdeduction back in writer sam bowman described full expensing as the best idea in politics that nobodys ever heard of you can read more here as bowman put it full expensing sounds technical and obscure and is unlikely to win votes on the doorstep it is not the sort of policy to win headlines but its effects seem like they could be very large and could deliver the sort of jobs and wages boost that would be popular for a government that seems desperate to boost investment especially investment in machineryintensive sectors like manufacturing it could be one of the few policy silver bullets it has left tim pitt of flint global a former advisor to philip hammond and sajid javid says it is very good news for the uks tax competitiveness but there will be a cliff edge as hunt has only announced full expensing for the next three years with an intention to make it permanent the ifss paul johnson says that it is ridiculous to only make the move temporary hunt says he wants to make the uk a better place for ai investment an ai sandbox will trial new means of promoting investment he says and he says he has accepted all the recommendations from the review by sir patrick vallance for the next years there will be an annual prize of m for ai research he says hunt says in the autumn statement he will return with plans to increase investment in highgrowth firms there will be measures to make the stock exchange a more attractive place to list he says he will reform the regulation of medicines which should make it easier for drugs to get approval he says hunt says the uk needs more nuclear power to encourage investment nuclear power will be classed as environmentally sustainable subject to consultation he says that will give it access to the same investment incentives as renewable energy he says the government will launch great british nuclear to bring down costs the title of this is very similar to great british energy the new nationalised startup proposed by labour hunt says there will be a competition for small nuclear reactors hunt says he will allocate up to bn for the early development of carbon capture and storage hunt says he is introducing a new tax credit for small and medium sized firms that spend of their expenditure on rampd tax reliefs for film tv and video gaming are also being extended he says hunt says he wants the uk to have the most probusiness proenterprise tax regime anywhere even with the corporation tax rise the uk will have the lowest headline rate in the g and only of firms will pay the full he says he says he is introducing a new investment allowance every pound invested in it equipment plant or machinery can be deducted immediately from profits it will be worth bn a year the obr says it will increase business investment by every year he says the uk will be the only european country with full expensing like this hunt says he is moving on to enterprise as opposition mps jeer hunt says enterprise has never been of interest to labour he wants to lower business taxes reduce energy costs and support growth industries hunt says he is giving communities more control of their destiny hunt says he will invest m in regeneration projects in england and m is being set aside for levelling up projects another bn is being set aside for sustainable transport schemes another m will be spent dealing with potholes and he announces equivalent funding for scotland wales and northern ireland hunt cites canary wharf as an example of a successful regeneration project he says he is announced investment zones which can be new canary wharfs he says they will be in the west midlands greater manchester the northeast south yorkshire west yorkshire east midlands teesside and liverpool there will also be at least one in scotland wales and northern ireland hunt confirms there will be extra defence spending it will go up by bn over the next five years and another m is being allocated for veterans he says hunt says the obr expects the uk will not enter a recession this year with a contraction of just thats an upgrade on the contraction forecast last november when the uk was forecast to drop into recession and after this year the uk economy will grow in every single year in the forecast period the chancellor says but growth is still relatively anaemic through the forecast period heres the details gdp up by up from the growth forecast last november down from growth forecast last november down from growth forecast last november down from growth forecast last november they also expect the unemployment rate to rise by less than one percentage point to with fewer people out of work compared to their autumn forecast paul johnson director of the institute for fiscal studies says that the expected fall in inflation this year will be good news but giving public sector workers a bit more would not have significantly pushed up the cost of living hunt says growth is the focus of the budget thirteeen years ago the government inherited an economy that had crashed he says he says people can now earn a month without paying a penny of tax or national insurance labour opposed those moves but they have helped to lift million people out of absolute poverty he says he says the world bank says the uk is the best big country to do business in declinists are wrong about the uk for another reason he says after the us and china the uk is the third largest tech economy he says we built the largest life sciences sector in europe producing a covid vaccine that saved million lives and a treatment that saved a million more our film and tv industry has become europes largest while the creative industry is growing at twice the rate of the economy our advanced manufacturing industries produce around half the worlds largest civil aircraft wings and thanks to a clean energy miracle we have become a world leader in offshore wind hunt says todays measures lead to a slightly lower tax burden by the end of this parliament the government is on track to halve inflation get debt falling and grow the economy he says hunt is now reading out the debt forecasts he says underlying debt is forecast to be of gdp next year then then before falling to in hunt confirms fuel duty will be frozen and he mocks labour claims they called for this first labour has opposed previous moves to freeze it he says hunt says he is giving m to allow charities to continue their fantastic work he will assign an extra m over the next two years to charities that address suicide and he will help the great british pub draught relief will be made more generous it will by up to p lower than the relief for supermarkets this is only possible because of brexit it amounts to a brexit pubs guarantee he says he says british ale is warm but duty is frozen hunt confirms that the energy price guarantee is being extended and he says over m households on prepayment meters will get help their charges will be aligned with direct debit charges until now they have had to pay more he says he has listened to representations from mps about the risk to swimming pools posted by high costs that provokes very loud labour jeering by mps making a point about rishi sunaks yorkshire heated swimming pool hunt says he has a m fund to keep these pools afloat hunt starts with the obr forecasts the pm wants to halve inflation he says the government supports the bank of englands independence on monetary policy hunt says this is the setting of interest rates by the boe the obr expects inflation to fall from to by the end of he says inflation hunt adds has been the root cause of the strikes seen in recent months antonia bance of the tuc tweets though that the strikes are also about the erosion of public sector pay since the financial crisis years ago hunt says the government has protected families with measures worth bn this year and next that is one of the biggest support packages in europe it is worth per household he says he says the government is committed to growth to prosperity with a purpose growth is one of the priorities for the pm hunt start by saying the british economy is proving the doubters wrong he took difficult decisions in the autumn he says the imf says the uk is on the right track but the government remains vigilant he says the obr now forecasts the uk will not enter a technical recession this year a technical recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row last november the obr had predicted that britain would fall into a recession lasting just over a year from the third quarter of with a peaktotrough fall in gdp of per cent jeremy hunt is about to start his statement sir bob neill con says motorists in outer london will be hit by the extension of the ulez zone

obligations and has schemes to help nickie aiken con says labourled westminster has increased council tax while putting up allowances for councillors by up to sunak says it is disappointing that

ireland sunak says the northern ireland secretary is working with the parties on these issues stephen flynn the snp leader at westminster says on monday scots learned the electricity grid had been upgraded to deal with the heating for the pool at sunaks constituency home was it while swimming the pm decided not to cut fuel bills sunak says the government has protected people flynn says in scotland the average heating bill is not but closer to the tories are not freezing energy bills they are looking to freeze households he says sunak says all parts of the uk benefit but he says we now know that under the snp the trains dont run on time and other service dont work that is not his assessment he says it is an snp one from their leadership debate angela richardson con asks sunak to welcome a space investment in her constituency guildford sunak says the government is continuing to invest in space starmer describes tory mps as playground bullies and cancel culture additcts sunak says he wont take lectures from labour on cancel culture he says starmer is avoiding the issue the only thing that happened this week was that labour did not vote for the illegal migration bill he has been delivering for britain he says starmer asks if the pm has had assurances that no one with links to the tory party was involved in the decision to cancel match of the day sunak says it is right the bbc takes its obligations to impartiality seriously that applies to the civil service too he says he is referring to sue gray starmer says sharp is not ordinary tory donor he has been called sunaks mentor and he organised a credit line for boris johnson is his position still tenable sunak says this appointment is being reviewed he will await the outcome of that starmer says tory mps dont understand you can disagree with what someone says but defend their right to say it the government put a tory donor with no broadcasting experience in charge of the bbc sunak says richard sharp was appointed as bbc chair before he was pm there was a rigorous process and the select committee backed it too that process is being reviewed by the office of the commissioner for public appointments starmer says the sight of tory mp howling with rage should have been laughable why wont he stand up to his snowflake mp sunak says this is the usual opportunism from starmer shadow ministers criticised gary linekers language too he says keir starmer says last year the pm said he wanted to protect free speech and end noplatforming so how concerned was he by tory mp trying to cancel a broadcaster sunak says that is a matter for the bbc danny kruger con says labour mps howled on monday when the home secretary said immigration had been too high does the pm agree we need to train our own labour sunak agrees he says there will be more on this in the budget there is a dramatic rebooting of our skills system he says jess phillips lab says she has worked with women brought to the uk as sex slaves last week the pm said people coming to the uk would be denied access to modern slavery protection how will phillips be able to help the next woman she meets from being repeatedly raped rishi sunak says a minority of people in the modern slavery system are from the uk that was not the intention when the system was set up he says rishi sunak chaired a cabinet meeting this morning where jeremy hunt outlined what would be in his budget in its readout no said sunak told cabinet it was no mistake that three of the governments five priorities were focused on the economy he said the budget will deliver on all three with a particular focus on growth as for what hunt said about the budget no said the chancellor began by thanking cabinet colleagues for their support over recent weeks he set out the improved economic picture following his autumn statement explaining it paved the way for this growth budget he referenced plans for deregulation with brexit freedoms plans to invest billions in carbon capture and storage and develop nuclear energy a boost to levelling up through investment zones across the uk and a significant package to help people get into work ranging from support for the overs those on benefits parents and those with longterm health conditions rishi sunak has left no for pmqs here is the list of mps down to ask a question one of the big tests for a budget is whether it can have a material impact on the opinion polls most of them dont and when they do the effect is as likely to be negative as postive two polls are out this morning showing what the baseline position is yougov has labour points ahead of the conservatives and savanta has labour points ahead savanta is something of an outlier in the polling industry in that most firms have been giving labour much bigger leads politico publishes a poll of polls aggregating what all polls are saying and this suggests labours lead has been relatively constant since the early days of rishi sunaks premiership steven swinford from the times says he is hearing that parents might have to wait a while for the extension of free childcare being announced by the chancellor today these are from ed conway economics editor at sky news according to the telegraph jeremy hunt faces a tory backlash over his decision to press ahead with the rise in corporation tax from to in the budget this will take effect from april this year the increase was first announced by rishi sunak when he was chancellor in his spring budget two years ago in theory hunt could have abandoned the rise but for the last two years apart from when kwasi kwarteng scrapped the increase during his shortlived time as chancellor treasury spending plans have been based on the assumption of extra revenue coming from and so junking it would have been hard in their telegraph story ben rileysmith and daniel martin report mr hunt will also try to take the sting out of the rise to by unveiling a multibillion pound scheme allowing businesses to reduce their tax bills by investing in the uk but there is already a growing backlash as conservative mps warned that the tax increase would have a chilling effect on the whole economy if not abandoned simon clarke the tory mp and former truss cabinet minister who helped set up the protax cuts conservative growth group issued a warning shot on tuesday night mr clarke told the telegraph there are some very welcome policies in this budget but it is also the case that there is real concern about the corporation tax rise in particular this is a tax on jobs and growth it is very hard to see how it doesnt have a chilling effect on the whole economy in a way which will cost every family in the country rileysmith and martin also says boris johnson is among the tories who have called for the increase to be abandoned even though it was initially announced when he was prime minister in its budget polling see am yougov found that voters are more likely to think the increase will be good for the economy than bad for the economy jeremy hunt has now left downing street for the house of commons on his way he posed for the traditional photographs with his budget red box and his ministerial team although policy specialists have welcomed the news that the budget will include a bn expansion of free childcare for one and twoyearolds in england see am some experts are sceptical the labour mp stella creasy says bn will not be enough to fund the scheme and the sutton trust the social mobility charity has sent out a briefing note pointing out that poorer families have less access to the current hours of free childcare available for three and fouryearolds which is conditional on both parents working at least hours a week than wealthier ones it wants to know if the same problem will apply to the new provision for one and twoyearolds the sutton trust also says hunt will have to assure the industry that that this pledge is properly funded it says if not the expansion will likely exacerbate provider financial problems and risk the sustainability of many many providers currently crosssubsidise underfunded free hours with hours charged at higher prices to parents elsewhere with an expansion of free hours to one and two yearolds there will be fewer places where providers can make up these costs pat mcfadden the shadow chief secretary to the treasury has said todays budget shows that labour is setting the agenda in an interview with gb news he cited action on childcare extending the energy price guarantee and freezing fuel duty as policies in the budget that labour was already advocating he said i do think weve set the agenda for some of this we called for example for an extension of the cap on energy prices for another few months we called for the freeze in fuel duty to be carried over for another year and weve been talking about childcare for quite a long time so im quite pleased that labour is setting the agenda if the government wants to follow our lead i dont mind that it does mean the next time you hear a government spokesperson saying labour is not fit to run the country then maybe we should question that because if theyre adopting so many of our policies then it suggests that were not as reckless as they sometimes suggest but mcfadden also suggested the government was not doing enough on growth he said if you look first and foremost at the green transition this is whats powering growth in the united states right now with president bidens inflation reduction act were just not on the pitch in the uk compared to what theyre doing in the united states right now only one voter in is confident that the budget will provide them with enough help with the cost of living according to new polling from yougov but almost four out of five people said extending the energy support guarantee which is happening would be helpful earlier i said in a post that the treasury did not release the normal prebudget photograph last night of the chancellor working on his speech with aides ive taken it down because it turned out they did it was just hard to find them because they werent in the usual place heres one the caption does not say what jeremy hunt and his aides were looking at on the phone but perhaps it was the news that the guardian was splashing their big announcement overnight the treasury released an extract from jeremy hunts budget speech he will say in the autumn we took difficult decisions to deliver stability and sound money today we deliver the next part of our plan a budget for growth not just growth from emerging out of a downturn but long term sustainable healthy growth that pays for our nhs and schools finds good jobs for young people provides a safety net for older people all whilst making our country one of the most prosperous in the world today i deliver that by removing the obstacles that stop businesses investing tackling the labour shortages that stop them recruiting breaking down the barriers that stop people working and harnessing british ingenuity to make us a science and tech superpower hundreds of thousands of workers are on strike today in what threatens to be the biggest strike since the current wave of industrial action started last year pa media reports pa says members of several trade unions will take action mounting hundreds of picket lines across the country amid continuing anger over issues including pay jobs pensions and conditions those striking include teachers university lecturers civil servants junior doctors london underground drivers and bbc journalists despite talks being held between unions and the westminster government the public sector strikes remain deadlocked some of the strikes such as those by teachers will only be held in england as progress has been made in wales and scotland the snp and the liberal democrats have both issued statements this morning saying the treasurys decision to extend the energy price guarantee at its current rate for another three months does not go far enough stewart hosie the snps economy spokesperson said its truly pathetic that the chancellor has failed to cut energy bills despite having ample resources to do so the tories are ripping families off by keeping bills at such exorbitantly skyhigh levels with many families forced to pay three times what they paid a year ago with energy companies making record profits and the wholesale price of gas falling there is no excuse for this shameful tory decision which will hammer household incomes and push even more families into poverty hardship and debt and sarah olney the lib dem treasury spokesperson said this does not go far enough instead of a sticking plaster for another three months we need meaningful action now the liberal democrats are calling on the chancellor to cut energy bills by per household this would make a significant difference to households and the government can afford to do it they are choosing not to in three months time families will once again be facing a cliff edge of unaffordable heating bills good morning last year we had a series of huge fiscal announcements from the treasury as well as perhaps the most consequential minibudget of all time it brought down a pm but we never an actual proper budget todays will be the first real once since autumn jeremy hunt will deliver it at pm rather deliver what is left of it the treasury itself has already briefed many of the significant measures in it it sent out at least eight budgetrelated press notices in recent days and another one arrived this morning confirming that under the energy price guarantee energy unit costs will be capped for another three months so that the average household faces an annual bill of the cap was due to rise at the end of april pushing an average bill up to there is more coverage of this on our business live blog chancellors always preannounce some of the secondorder budget announcement because otherwise they will get no coverage on the day but they like to save up something popular for the day itself conventionally this is described as the rabbit being pulled out of the hat yesterday the guardian got hold of the rabbit and we yanked it out ourselves hunt is going to announce a bn expansion of free childcare for one and twoyearolds in england you can read the details here magicians pull rabbits out of hats by means of an illusion its fake budget announcements are meant to be a bit more credible and so far the reaction to the childcare news has been positive james bowen director of policy for school and nursery at naht the union for headteachers said while we will need to look closely at the detail if the government does increase the hourly funding rates to early years providers this will be welcome news we know that the funding settings currently receive from government is woefully inadequate and many providers simply cannot afford to operate at those levels paul johnson director of the institute for fiscal studies said the news was welcome but that a wider review in this area was needed abby jitendra a family policy expert at the joseph rowntree foundation also applauded the announcement while saying wider change was needed sebastian payne who runs onward a rightleaning thinktank also praised the announcement and this is from justine roberts founder of the mumsnet website if you will forgive the mangling of two hackneyed political cliches hunt may be pulling out a rabbit but shooting the fox labour has made it clear that it wants to make a big childcare promise part of its retail offer to voters at the next election hunt is now making that harder in an initial response to the story rachel reeves the shadow chancellor told lbc last night if its a serious package

in his spring budget the chancellor jeremy hunt announced landmark plans to extend free childcare in england to infants aged one and two as part of a drive to boost the workforce in a bn policy move hunt said the government would offer hours of free childcare for every child from the age of nine months where all adults in the household work at least hours he says this will reduce childcare costs for a family by nearly however the changes will take time to implement hunt said adding that such a large reform must be introduced in stages to ensure there is enough supply in the market as a result working parents of twoyearolds will get hours of free childcare from april extended to hours by here nursery providers and mothers react davinia haynes from london for us the news is disappointing we woke up thinking we would get the support this year so the timing of how long it will take to implement is off its progress but doesnt make a huge difference in terms of financial help right now as our daughter will be two years and eight months when the changes come in next april this definitely feels like a political play ahead of the election next year i have one daughter who is months and my husband and i both work fulltime so she is at nursery all week as we do not have help from family in north london where we live a lot of the nurseries only take children from two years old and it costs us a month which is over a third of our combined earnings we both have wellpaid jobs in consulting and publishing but with childcare a mortgage a car plus cost of living its tight we have not been on holiday since last april and i doubt we will go away this year we are in the middle ground where it just about works but we dont have financial freedom to have a life especially considering we both work hard i have thought about giving up work but what i earn contributes just about enough to household income to make it slightly worthwhile i have worked hard to get where i am so i felt terrible even considering giving that up sophie louise chatz from bristol we wont benefit from the new rules but i am really pleased for future mothers and the families who will the extra support is great but it also needs to ensure there are enough nursery spaces i signed up my monthold daughter evie for nursery at the start of and the waiting list was months long so she doesnt have a place until next summer nurseries also need the right support to provide what the government is funding my daughter is with a childminder two days a week which is more affordable than a nursery and it still costs me a third of my earnings i work for a charity parttime and the rest of the time evie is with me and her grandparents we partly made this decision because we wanted her to be with family at least some of the time but cost is definitely a consideration too between tax and high childcare costs when you can only keep a small proportion of your earnings it is disincentivising as a freelancer free childcare would mean more financial resilience my partner and i are both freelance which means neither of our work has any real security it could end at any time leaving the other as the sole earner when you add the huge cost of childcare and the high cost of living you can find yourself in a precarious situation quite quickly i am less affected than a lot of people many women i know havent gone back to work as childcare costs more than they earn but i feel angry that women are not valued more having children is not a lifestyle choice young people are essential to the health of society tarek elsemman owner of little jungle nursery in peckham south london we have been open since and before then my wife and coowner caroline and i were in corporate work she did marketing and i did consultancy at the moment at little jungle to send a child here fulltime five days a week hours a day its a month that is a year although we are on the expensive side our profit margins are a year so its hardly worth doing for perspective i had to take loans and extend our overdraft because every month is a struggle to pay peoples salaries the measures announced in the budget are disappointing hunt said he would increase the funding rates for children but it would be good to understand how that translates per child an hour this is not going to stop nurseries going out of business the supply of nursery places will not improve through this and when the full hours comes in is too far away government funding for children from nine months is great but the rate of funding has to be right because it costs more to look after younger children we were hoping to see business rates reliefs on nurseries because this was done quickly during covid so it can be done changing the early years staffperchild ratio in england from to for twoyearolds is not good any good provider will not do that because decreasing headcount lowers quality gemma rolstone director of puffins nurseries in exeter i am gobsmacked to be honest the system we have is broken and is not fit for purpose and the fact they have just said they are going to extend that beggars belief at least the extra hours is not happening immediately which gives time to think about what that means because if they fund it at the rate they say they are going to there is absolutely no way it will be viable for so many settings we are not expecting to make a profit this year its frustrating as we have been shouting about this for years and it gets worse but we are all in it for the children so the majority of us will fight to the bitter end because nurseries do a lot more over and above what most people think they do for the families we support we are counsellors and nurses and befrienders we help parents fill out forms and open our doors for anything and everything we help parents navigate the benefit systems and apply for schools we give advice on sleeping and eating and behaviour and all else in between none of

campaigners parents and the earlyyears sector in england have welcomed a major extension of state support for childcare costs but warned that the plans would take years to come into effect and fail without sufficient funding in a move that was met with delight by parents but given a cautious welcome by campaigners the chancellor jeremy hunt confirmed a bn expansion of free childcare for all preschool children from and announced an ambition for all state primaries to provide childcare before and after lessons from as part of a wider drive to help people into work and boost growth the plan will provide an extra hours a week during term time to parents of children from the age of nine months to two years matching the existing offering for three and fouryearolds i dont want any parents with a child under five to be prevented from working if they want to because its damaging to our economy and unfair mainly to women said hunt as he claimed the move would reduce childcare costs for families by nearly some parents were disappointed by the phased introduction of free hours with one telling the guardian for us the news is disappointing and it doesnt make a huge difference in terms of financial help right now this definitely feels like a political play ahead of the election next year the reform will be introduced in stages to ensure supply in the market with working parents of twoyearolds able to access hours of free care a week during term time from april while ninemontholds would qualify for funding by september from september all working parents of underfives would have access to hours free childcare a week the chancellor said however some campaigners said the delaywas necessary to avoid overwhelming the sector an increase in the number of twoyearolds each adult can look after in a childcare setting from to was met with anger by campaigners who argued it ignored their concerns and would increase pressure on overworked and poorly paid staff the chancellor promised more funding for the earlyyears sector which has long argued that the amount providers receive from the government for the current free hours offer leaves them out of pocket the funding gap has driven many providers out of business in an effort to prevent further nursery closures hunt promised an increase of free hours funding of m from this september rising to m next year which he claimed was a rise the womens budget group estimated that funding the current hours for three and fouryearolds would cost an additional bn far greater than the amount promised by the government appealing to parents with older children hunt said the government would also fund schools and local authorities to increase the availability of wraparound care for parents of schoolage children from am and pm however the change will not come into force until the chancellor also confirmed that parents on universal credit can now get childcare costs paid upfront while the amount they can claim back will rise to and for two children an increase of almost addressing a significant decline in childminders which he said had dropped by in england in one year hunt said the government would pilot incentive payments of for new childminders rising to for those who join through an agency keir starmer accused the government of following labours lead on pushing for childcare reform adding that while more money in the system was a positive as parents up and down the country know its no use having more free hours if you cant access them and it pushes up the costs for parents joeli brearley founder of the campaign group pregnant then screwed described the move as a really significant moment but she warned that the bn investment was insufficient research from the confederation of british industry cbi estimates that fully funding the existing schemes for three to fouryearolds and expanding the scheme to one and twoyearolds would cost bn the fact that childcare is the most important part of the budget announcement shows that the government is taking this seriously said brearley we need to make sure there is enough funding we need a workforce strategy but i feel today was a big leap forward charities also warned about the shortage of supply in the sector there are children for every childcare place in england and there has been a decline in the number of providers since according to labour analysis of government figures a separate survey of local authorities in england by the childrens charity coram found that only half had sufficient childcare places to meet the demand of parents working full time neil leitch ceo of the early years alliance said the move was be a gamechanger for families but he also stressed that any free hours needed to be properly funded we need to make sure that new investment supports the sector and improves the quality and availability of childcare for every child as well as making it affordable for parents he said he called government moves to push ahead with plans to relax ratios for twoyearolds from to which hunt said would be optional for provider shameful and warned it would risk quality and increase pressure on educators with no benefit to

after nearly a decade working as cabin crew for an international airline i have a sixth sense for when a passenger is about to ask me a question on a flight last month two parents stand in the aisle before takeoff laden with baby gear huffing and puffing i clock them gesturing towards a woman seated in an aisle seat travelling alone the man calls me over looking exasperated he wants to be able to sit with his partner and two young children but his familys seats are spread across a row with an aisle in between them he tells me he wants me to ask the woman to move so the family can sit together cabin crew have a term for these kinds of passengers the mary and josephs parents who act like they were the very first people on the planet to have children you can often spot them loitering in the galley or carrying way too much luggage they ask cabin crew to heat their baby bottles and food they complain about the temperature on a recent flight to los angeles one parent even told me to be quiet because their baby was sensitive to noise when i was younger and less assertive i might have felt pressured to ask that woman to move even though thats not a part of our job as crew crew have no power to move people out of their seats for any reason other than safety for example if i have concerns a person seated in an emergency exit row may not be capable of operating the door but i wont be made to feel guilty any more especially when someone has paid extra for a comfortable seat even if that means a family has to be seated separately the woman travelling alone is seated in the bulkhead row row with extra legroom moving her to the seat behind would mean a less comfortable flight for her why should she have to give up her comfort for someone elses children i am fed up of solo passengers having to accommodate other travellers just because they have kids in tow cabin crew are being asked more and more to accommodate seating arrangements for people who havent planned ahead affronted parents sidle up to me all the time asking can you please tell them to move we have a child is this really reasonable when all passengers have the option to pay a small fee to book a specific seat is it really so complicated for parents to plan ahead too often the single people who are being asked to move are women after nearly a decade working as cabin crew i cant recall a single occasion when someone has asked me to move a solo male passenger perhaps people assume single men have a better reason to be travelling alone or that women will be more likely to move i tell the father i cant force anyone to change seats if theyve prebooked their seat he will have to ask her to move himself he shuffles off sulking i watch and hope he doesnt bother the woman shes about my mothers age my mother the newly widowed newly single woman i hope he doesnt shame her for travelling alone maybe shes on some little shirley valentine holiday for herself to talk to a rock in greece

as the baby turns one ive been looking back at the past year which seems somehow to have been both the longest and shortest of my life and reflecting on what ive learned i embarked upon parenthood thinking i was at least a little bit prepared in terms of what it involved only for it to be made swiftly apparent that i am utterly clueless in fact one of the sharpest most humbling lessons so far has been the dawning understanding that no one actually really knows what they are doing most of the time i suspect that before a baby arrives we all have some ideas about the sort of parents we are going to be only to guiltily dispense with those principles one by one as the child grows this has never been more apparent to me than when thinking about screen time how i laugh now at the sweet summer child who obnoxiously recommended the cbeebies prom to my fellow national childbirth trust nct mums keen to stress that of course i turned his bouncer to face away from the screen im surprised the poor baby didnt get a crick in his neck from craning to see what was going on i gave up trying in the end by the time he was six months old he had watched a fair bit of football and most of wimbledon with my husband and quite a lot of strictly with my mother neither of whom are as neurotic as me guidance on screen time varies american paediatricians those voices of authority who loom over anything you google about babies ever consult them consult them you are implored say no screen time until months in the uk we are more realistic the nhs and nice recommend an upper limit of two hours a day the royal college of paediatrics and child health rcpch criticised the us guidelines and the nct stresses the benefits to parents and children in that it helps give children downtime and their carers get things done around the house which is code for drink a glass of wine on the sofa though i have written before about the pressure on mothers especially to entertain and educate their babies constantly making everything a learning opportunity at least in this one respect our health bodies and charities seem to recognise a more balanced approach is needed of course that doesnt mean we dont feel guilty i have yet to hear a parent discuss screen time without it being in a hushed tone of someone admitting to a shameful secret the baby has been through another period of illness as well as adjustment to nursery and tv has enabled him to rest and recuperate when he hasnt felt like playing when a few months ago he was hospitalised disney songs kept him calm and still while the tubes and wires could do their work making him better when he said bear clear as a bell while watching a song from the jungle book i thought well telly cant be all bad and yet the guilt persists my husband who is from a large family and whose first words were joe montana argues that some of this is precious firstborn syndrome if you have more than one child good luck trying to stop them from watching tv he points out that he watched backtoback ninja turtles not to mention the four hours preceding ninja turtles while they waited for it to come on im not talking about ninja turtles though i wailed im talking about the bbc philharmonic orchestra clearly i need to get over myself which is why i think transparency about screen time is important even if it means being judged people treat it as though youre using it as a standin for a lovely countryside walk or a day at the museum as opposed to quiet time a friend whose toddler has additional needs says that screen time is crucial for him to decompress after nursery my own brother is autistic and coming across something special on cbeebies which uses makaton to help children with communication difficulties actually made me feel quite tearful as nothing like this existed when he was young yes its easy to see how too much screen time could affect development but an allornothing approach helps no one especially not when you are desperately trying to make a seemingly simple supper of pasta and tomato sauce which these days feels as ambitious as the coq au vin i used to do from scratch prebaby without the bairn wreaking havoc so i acknowledge with a full heart that i have used tv to help me parent and i feel incredibly grateful to the bbc i now understand as no doubt many many of you did before me why she is an auntie to so many of us the quality of the programming for young children is astonishing and all without having to expose them to advertising which i loathe and which is my parental red line yes having the theme tune to small potatoes described as an animated series about a group of potatoes who sing songs in different genres going round my head at am is not ideal but ill take it for the joy it gives my boy you have probably noticed that ive focused mostly on television and thats because the other kind of screen time feels less benevolent come back to me when my toddler is bidding for postman pat memorabilia on ebay using my paypal and has become prey to the youtube algorithm and perhaps well have a different sort of conversation but for now the screen time in our lives all feels very gentle wholesome and educational and i feel ever so slightly less exhausted and overwrought whats working ive loved the work of alice neel since i was a student and i wrote recently about the book the baby on the fire escape which sheds light on how she juggled art with motherhood so it was a great thrill to see so many of her portraits in one place at the barbican in london her paintings of pregnant women and mothers with babies are particularly affecting whats not im wondering if its now officially too late to send thankyou cards for all the newborn gifts we received a year ago amid the shock of a premature delivery and caring for a baby that should have still been in the womb i somehow got it together to have cards made but the time in which to write and send them has eluded me though

jeremy hunt is due to set out the governments plans for tax and spending in his first budget on wednesday meanwhile the office for budget responsibility obr will publish updated economic forecasts and

expected to cut its inflation forecast for this year from to nearer and to provide a sunnier picture of economic growth revising the projected fall from to nearer it is also expected to say that the spending deficit improved after a rise in tax receipts mainly due to higher than expected inflation over the last year hunt could have as much as bn spare and still bring down borrowing over the life

scrapping taxfree childcare for schoolage children separately changes are planned to help with childcare costs for people in england scotland and wales who are eligible for universal credit under the current system parents can only reclaim the cost of childcare weeks after paying for it this often leads to financial difficulties with those on already tight budgets being forced into debt to cover the upfront costs childcare refunds for those on universal credit have been capped at a month per child for several years cutting its value at a time of escalating childcare costs hunt will say childcare refunds will be paid upfront and there could also be an increase possibly worth several hundred pounds a year in the cap pensions a rise in taxfree saving for the wealthy is expected in the budget in an attempt to tackle the pension trap which has led many professionals including nhs consultants and gps to take early retirement hunt is preparing a significant increase in the amount that can be set aside taxfree each year and a rise in the cap on how much can be saved taxfree known as the lifetime allowance lta the lta is expected to rise to m up from its current cap of the annual allowance the most a worker can save in their pension pots in a year before paying tax is set to rise to from its current mark of investment tech hubs clustered around universities in england will benefit from almost bn in extra funding as part of a range of measures hunt is introducing to boost business investment in the regions the chancellor will pledge to create investment zones in eight

a bn expansion of free childcare for one and twoyearolds in england is expected to be announced in the budget on wednesday as part of a wider drive to help people into work and boost growth the plan would provide an extra hours a week to parents of one and twoyear olds and increase funding by m by for the existing programme of free childcare for three yearolds the chancellor jeremy hunt is planning to increase the hourly rate paid to childcare providers by the government to deliver their existing hours weekly entitlement a key demand from the sector and some conservative mps the government will give local authorities funding to start setting up wraparound childcare provision in schools starting in september as it tries to match labours pledge to come up with a bold offer on childcare ahead of the next election the guardian revealed last month that the treasury had commissioned work to look at the costings of free childcare for one and twoyearolds but hunt had feared it would prove too expensive however it is understood the proposal came back on the table following forecasts that suggested it could help boost growth childcare has emerged as a key political battleground in the runup to the next election with uk parents facing among the highest costs in the world meaning that some parents even those on middle incomes conclude it is not worth taking on new or extra work officials suggested the measure could be hunts rabbit from the hat moment in a statement that was otherwise expected to yield few surprises with the chancellor downplaying expectations of tax cuts or other big spending commitments rishi sunak was understood to be taking a final decision on signing off the plan which government insiders believe would help him deliver on his pledge to increase sluggish growth on his return from the us on tuesday while the markets have calmed since liz trusss disastrous minibudget last september and the economic outlook is less turbulent millions of people are still grappling with the cost of living while inflation is at a year high and the country is gripped by strikes conservative mps who have called for tax cuts are likely to be disappointed as the chancellor focuses on delivering sunaks pledge to boost growth by encouraging the overs people with disabilities and chronic conditions and benefits claimants back into the workplace the chancellor is also expected to extend household energy bill support by three months increase corporation tax from to in april freeze fuel duty and announce a bn boost for defence spending the government is also expected to bring in changes to the stafftochild ratios for twoyearolds in childcare moving from to to align with scotland and will consult on further measures to give providers flexibility the plan was first mooted by liz truss but was reported to have been scrapped by sunak as it would prove expensive and unpopular one treasury source suggested that the department for education could decide how to split the new funding better between the existing offer for threeyearolds and new provision for younger age groups a second senior whitehall source said they believed that hunt could set out a new free hours entitlement for parents of children aged between nine and months and an additional offer for oneyearolds from disadvantaged families they also said that the dfe had been pushing for the hours to be funded at cost rather than the current low rate which has led to childcare providers struggling and in many cases asking for topup payments from parents many experts have been warning that government subsidies are not sufficient to fund the places needed leading to large supply gaps in parts of the country in hammersmith and fulham in london for example a recent study by nesta showed that a place for a twoyearold cost an hour the government subsidy rate for that place is it is all about getting money to the providers at this point said one tory mp unless they are properly funded for what they do there is no point just offering more and more hours the chancellor said on sunday that childcare costs were stopping some parents from taking a job and the government could make a big difference by helping to reduce them further as part of a package of measures to break down barriers to entering the workforce ministers have already announced plans to be confirmed in the budget to pay childcare support to parents on universal credit up front instead in arrears the current amonth per child cap on support is also expected to increase by several hundred pounds however the chancellor had downplayed the prospect of expanding free childcare provision now we would like to help everyone its expensive to do it you cant always do everything at once

joanna jayarajan a selfemployed mother of two from london is one of many thousands of working parents in britain for whom the current childcare offer simply does not work she used to work five days a week providing extracurricular activities in schools and nurseries until she lost her last au pair a year ago and subsequently a chunk of her income her wages more than offset the cost of the childcare i can now only work about three days a week because i have my sevenyearold every day after school my twoyearold is with two different childminders but my older one has been on a waiting list for after school club since january my work requires flexibility and like for other people who work shifts or irregular hours au pairs previously provided affordable flexible childcare but since we left the eu it has been impossible to find an au pair as the pool of legal candidates is limited to very few i now have to work less because i dont have anyone who can help my parents are not well enough so i have to beg favours from other mums or from my babysitter to plug the gap jayarajan says she would use babysitters who cost an hour locally more frequently if the government provided financial assistance for childcare that is not ofstedregistered i know so many parents especially in the medical field gps nurses midwives who are basically screwed because of the lack of flexible affordable childcare my friend is training as a midwife shes got three kids and was thinking about sending them to her inlaws in cyprus so she can work her shifts pressure is building for the chancellor jeremy hunt to announce some help for hardpressed parents in wednesdays budget jayarajan is one of dozens of parents who got in touch with the guardian to share that they are finding ofstedregistered childcare in a formal setting either unaffordable or unavailable when they need it and have to ask family for help selffund informal arrangements with babysitters they do not have to pay during holidays or work fewer hours professional childcare is more expensive in the uk than in any other developed nation according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development a couple earning twothirds of the average income with two children aged two and three can spend of their salary on childcare that compares with in france and in germany a combination of the pandemic and the governments decision not to fully reimburse nurseries for the cost of providing free hours to two and threeyearolds has driven many nurseries out of business even for families that can afford it professional childcare is not always available particularly wraparound care for schoolage children ranging from breakfast to afterschool clubs the childcare crisis has exacerbated another problem on hunts to do list a lack of workers to fill job vacancies according to the office for national statistics more than million workingage adults in the uk stayed out of paid work in order to look after family members in the last quarter of while as many as threequarters of firms in britain have struggled to recruit workers over the past year with more than m vacancies nationwide andrea leadsom the tory mp and former leadership candidate who has advised the government on early years policy last month proposed the idea that parents should be allowed to use government childcare subsidies more flexibly in future including for childcare provided by grandparents and unregistered babysitters i think that we need maximum flexibility for parents decisions about their own childcare needs she told politicshome id also like to see more informal childcare supported so that when grandparents take on caring responsibilities they can be helped to do so id love to see a real huge surge in childminding because quite often for very young children a home setting is the right answer jen a business manager from glasgow would greatly benefit from such a scheme and save thousands of pounds a year my mother looks after our son two days a week it costs us about a month as we pay her the average childminder rate for our area we chose this as we thought a blended model of childcare including nursery a day with me and these days would benefit my son my mother cares for him one day at her house and one day at ours which also allows me greater flexibility to see him at lunchtime and immediately before and after work kat from sheffield was among a number of parents who said they have only been able to keep their jobs because grandparents stopped working or reduced their hours to look after their children between my maternity leave ending and my boy starting school he was looked after by myself my husband my retired dad and my motherinlaw who changed her work pattern reducing her income to help us she said were really lucky that family live close by and were willing to drop everything for us we couldnt have afforded the childcare if we had had to pay for cate a single mother on universal credit from brighton who until recently paid more than a month for a babysitter she found on an app the ability to claim back some of her informal childcare costs would be a godsend i had to give up my job because i just couldnt afford paying for childcare any more not without a shred of government support the yearold said i worked evenings in hospitality so nurseries and childminders wouldnt be an option plus they are too expensive anyway if id been able to claim government funding for babysitters i could have stayed in my job it would change my life completely i could build a career this way im just stuck waiting until my child goes to school other parents would prefer cheaper and more accessible ofstedregistered nurseries or childminders instead susanne a freelancer and mother of two from bristol worries about the quality and safety of childcare provided by sitters without dbs checks and training inexperienced teenagers or elderly family members my

while acknowledging that the costs and lack of childcare provision are two major reasons why parents dont return to work a sick child means a hole in our budget thats the reality of life as a working parent march a third is rarely mentioned the difficulties when parents of young children must leave for work before their childrens schools or nurseries open or they have a late overnight or early shift before brexit provided they had a spare bedroom such families could employ an au pair in exchange for a room in london full board and lodging free internet use free use of laundry machines all workrelated expenses free weekends and a week our familys au pairs undertook hours negotiated light work each week they managed the school and nursery runs and were available on inset days enabling parents to attend meetings parents evenings and so on before and after school knowing the children were safe for shift workers such as doctors nurses transport workers and so on there was always a responsible adult in the house in their absence our au pairs also taught the children their language and became such close friends that two are godparents and holiday visits to them all are the norm the government stopped that no twoyear visas unless studying for so many hours that au pairing is impossible european au pairs feel too unwelcome here now exactly who has benefited from this insane ideologically driven prevention not children not working adults not the economy so who anne johns derby a guardian editorial on march criticised labour for its nebulous growth mission while saying little about the far superior goals of maximising wellbeing and reducing inequalities it is very sad that in the current complaint about the lack of affordable childcare in this country we only hear about the goal of growth the focus is on women not being able to go out to work with no mention of the emotional needs of children in her article lucy pasharobinson bemoans the fact that women are plugging holes in the state provision of childcare with unpaid labour if they could work she says their additional economic output would contribute the equivalent of of the countrys gdp she mentions among other countries france which offers free childcare from the age of two months onwards as if this is a policy we should emulate pasharobinson rightly states that there are reams of evidence on childhood development that has shown time and time again that education in our early years dictates future outcomes there are also reams of evidence that show that bonding with a parent in early years determines the future wellbeing of a child why does satisfactory educational care of a child have to be separated from satisfactory emotional care instead of subjecting children too young to appreciate time to the terror of separation from a loving parent wouldnt it be better to offer help to mothers who suffer loneliness and feelings of being undervalued when they are looking after youngsters financial help would come into this but equally important would be cooperation with other parents as well as help from professionals the sure start programme eliminated by the tories and promised again by labour would be a partial but welcome start to this goal of maximising wellbeing and reducing inequalities anne tyndale brighton thank you to larry elliott for shining a light on the impact of childcare costs on womens ability to go to work uk women priced out of work by lack of affordable childcare pwc finds march i would recommend that he next look into the specific impact felt by mums of twins i am in the fortunate position of having a wellpaid career that enabled me to chose to return to work but i was surprised at how close to unlikely that ultimately financial decision was as a parent of twins it can be a shock to find that nurseries offer discounts of as little as we made the decision to pay just a little extra to hire a nanny when our nanny is occasionally unavailable the costs are extortionate we recently had to use more than of savings for a short stint at a childminder i am lucky on twin mum whatsapp groups i have read messages from many mums who are

we are at an impasse my son stares me down over a plate of mexican rice he is an immovable object for whom my dinner is clearly not an irresistible force had you entered our kitchen minutes ago you would have thought us a harmonious pair we have an admittedly possibly even revoltingly cutesy poster framed beside the door which declares this kitchen is for dancing and he has always taken it quite literally today we were sweating up a storm to our perennial favourite nce again by client an anonymous musician whose mix of menacing electro and garbled computer voices has proven an unlikely hit with my fouryearold my ulterior motive is to wear him down so he cant put up a struggle when dinnertime arrives it has not worked and now hes just sweaty while he stares at me i am not a picky eater myself and never was i would go so far as to say that my childhood appetites were almost worryingly undiscerning my attitude to food has always been basically yes it would be easy to say this was because i grew up with siblings but there were picky eaters among us by the time he was three my little brother conalls pickiness had become so pronounced that my father made him sit by his side for meals with no one allowed to leave until hed finished as such he bore not just the pressure of his father but his siblings loudly willing him to eat so they could get on with their lives i dont remember him ever relenting the only proof he ever did is that i now live in london which means i must have been released from that table eventually it seems my son takes after his uncle and im a poor match i am not a stubborn person barring coldwater swimming or paying for youtube i can be talked into anything id like to think this is due to some deepseated agreeableness in my character but it is more likely a function of sheer laziness sure i cant be arsed to go to that gig you keep recommending but i really cant be arsed arguing with you about it lets go and have a terrible time together i will learn nothing and probably do it again so i play good cop and bad cop i use my hardest fatherly stare and then remind my son of all the wonderful things he can do once he leaves this table if he eats just three more spoonfuls tiny advances are made on the chessboard i halve the amount of food in the catchment zone i wear him down to eating just the rice and carrots leaving the peas and chicken pieces for another day he groans weeps and announces he is now too tired to eat too tired to lift your fork i ask yes he confirms sadly and i tell him that we can knock the dancing on the head from now on since i had no idea it was affecting him so he looks at me with horror and finally raises his spoon as if its loaded with poison this kitchen may be for dancing i say but eating is

poorer working parents are to be given more help with the costs of childcare as part of this weeks budget after warnings that support for them has been severely eroded and that claiming it is too complicated parents eligible for help through universal credit will now be given childcare funding upfront while it is understood that the amount they can claim will increase by hundreds of pounds however the budget will also contain more obligations on such parents to search for work and there will be a general tightening of sanctions aimed at those on welfare the extra help for childcare costs comes after an outcry from local government councils across england have joined calls for more support amid concerns that only of parents are claiming the falling level of support they are entitled to receive under the current universal credit system working households can claim back of childcare costs up to a maximum of a month for one child or for two or more however the cap has remained the same since despite childcare costs more than doubling since then in some cities including london it means that in of local areas the average price of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two is higher than the maximum costs supported through universal credit and the benefits system in a major pitch ahead of the budget the local government association lga the main body for councils in england has backed a significant increase in the cap in line with inflation it is also demanding a major publicity campaign after the most recent figures showed eligible parents from a total of are not even claiming childcare costs the uk has one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world which is impacting many lowincome families at a time when the cost of living has rocketed said louise gittins chair of the lgas children and young people board the cap on childcare support for working parents receiving benefits has not changed in almost years while childcare costs have more than doubled during that time we feel it would be only fair and right for the cap to be increased in line with inflation in the budget it is also worrying that hundreds of thousands of eligible parents are not claiming any childcare support that may be their choice or it could be down to difficulties they have accessing the system this should be urgently looked into to assess whether more parents could be getting the help they desperately need the size of the childcare package in the budget remains unclear while treasury insiders accept that childcare costs have become a big issue that is preventing people returning to work some of the more expensive options for helping parents have already been rejected the idea of extending hours of free childcare to one and twoyearolds in england is said to have been rejected on cost grounds after being presented to the chancellor as an option by education department officials the plan would cost about bn roughly equivalent to a penny increase in income tax under the current system in england some poorer households qualify for hours of free childcare for twoyearolds all households get hours childcare for three and fouryearolds and some families with working parents qualify for free hours the chancellor jeremy hunt said those who can work should work because independence is always better than dependence for many people there are barriers preventing them from moving into work lack of skills a disability or health condition or having been out of the jobs market for an extended period of time i want this backtowork budget to break down these barriers and help people find jobs that are right for them labour is also targeting childcare as a big part of its manifesto at the next election bridget

since its not often that the domestic violence community enjoys official recognition the knighthood proposed by boris johnson for the breaker of his late mothers nose stanley johnson should be welcome to at least some people outside the family would it be unreasonable for his fellow perpetrators of intimate partner violence against women ipvaw to interpret stanleys honour still more optimistically as evidence that the tory party now appreciates that its domestic abuse act was totally over the top the purported aim of that legislation being first of all to raise awareness and understanding about the devastating impact of domestic abuse on victims and their families in the case of stanley his exwife the late artist charlotte wahl kept his abuse secret until four years ago when she told boriss biographer tom bower that their marriage had been ghastly terrible i want the truth told she said about stanleys violence which was witnessed by boris he hit me many times over many years early on he resented her seeing her friends and thats when he first hit me later she was deposited in the country without a car to adultery and violence his family could add deserter although the full extent of her domestic torment was not made clear in extracts published by the daily mail in it became national news that boriss dad broke his mums nose after a breakdown wahl had been admitted to the maudsley hospital where doctors she said spoke to stanley about his abuse of me her parents confronted stanley but he denied it more allegations are available in bowers biography of boris the gambler stanleys denials have been reported but remain hard to source should rishi sunak allow his knighthood there could hardly be a clearer sign that the tory approach to domestic abuse will be resuming after a temporary show of interest the default complacency that allowed theresa may to award the same honour to geoffrey boycott hed been convicted in for repeatedly punching a girlfriend sir geoffreys response when asked about this i couldnt give a toss the king too if he intends to indulge johnsonian overreach might want to consider the academic contention that public attitudes towards ipvaw shape as one study puts it the social environment in which such violence takes place and attitudes of acceptability to ipvaw are considered a risk factor to actual ipvaw it follows that policymakers and public figures who are serious about protecting women will not want honours conferred on men who hit them a knighthood for stanley can raise awareness only of what remains evident from abject conviction rates from sickening police attitudes again exposed in the case of david carrick and indeed from much of the medias lingering regard for postdisgrace stanley domestic abuse remains one lethal epidemic society can live with after wahl finally disclosed what bower calls the familys great secret broadcasters appetite for her persecutors fatuous condescension continued as inexplicably keen as it was before he was exposed given an honour he might even be able to increase his fees that stanley has seen no necessity for perceptible regret or a hint of shame can if sunak agrees to his elevation only remind abuse victims that their assaults at home by the men in or once in their lives are still considered less not more serious than assaults by strangers had stanley been revealed by bower to have once broken a random womans nose in the street or repeatedly hit female strangers in public even his son might have anticipated an absolute refusal to honour such a man since the victim of these acts of violence was boriss mother assaulted at home by someone he would call a loved one he could reasonably expect what happened last week a recoil from above all his latest venture in cronyism many responses to news that our leading nepotist plans more nepotism ranked stanleys domestic violence supposing it came up among the lesser objections to boriss continued perversion of the honours system keir starmer said it was absolutely outrageous why the idea of an exprime minister bestowing honours on his dad on question time fiona bruce helpfully depicted the nosebreaking as a oneoff so far sunak has offered only a pleasantry about fathers day cards these interpretations spared defenders of stanleys promotion such as his sons ex petronella wyatt the bother of defending a title for a wife beater wyatt argued that stanley was a better environmentalist than his son who on one occasion while driving with me in the country threw empty champagne bottles out of the car window admittedly the sheer range of awfulness associated with stanley johnson from his zeal for population control and six children unwanted touching contempt for the public china promotion and mask noncompliance to a capacity for aggression rachel johnson called muscular fatherhood complicates attempts to express just how overwhelmingly squalid and damaging would be his knighthood press caution or squeamishness about naming stanleys domestic violence is also understandable given his sympathisers determination to call the nosebreaking an isolated incident as the mail categorised it last week the same paper when revealing the attack had quoted family friends saying it was a oneoff that it happened in the s when wahl was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and incautiously flailed at stanley you had to get the book to discover that his hitting was repeated and critical in her wish to divorce her close friends bower writes knew that the fact that she was no longer prepared to put up with the violence was the tipping point as for the s wahl evidently did not think too late for everyone to learn more about the ubiquitous stanley johnson but perhaps rishi sunak if he permits her abusers knighthood will prove her wrong catherine bennett is an observer columnist do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article if you would like to submit a letter of up to words

an awardwinning childrens centre in corby northamptonshire is about to be hit with an estimated funding cut from its local council demolishing all that its famous for it is the culmination of the year destruction of labours sure start programme i have been visiting pen green over many years it is considered a beacon and model for childrens centres training thousands of earlyyears teachers and childcare specialists and visited by people from all the world who want to copy its success this wilful destruction hits one of the most deprived parts of corby a labour town now swallowed up by tory north northamptonshire the council is taking the money to spread among three nurseries in less deprived zones a depressing reminder of how much more damage the conservatives can still do in their swansong remaining months under threat before pen green was rescued by a former tory minister but the childrens minister claire coutinho has told pen green she wont save it what bad timing amid a great groundswell of protest about the collapsing nursery system before next weeks budget costing an unaffordable average of just under a year for a fulltime place for a child under two nurseries are closing in droves unable to finance the governments socalled free hours with pay so low that childcare assistants flee elsewhere the fact is the sum the government pays to supposedly cover these hours is far too little so nurseries struggle unless they can charge parents significant extras i know of no social issue that has aroused such a surprising coalition of quite different interests to demand radical reform it would once be unthinkable that the cbi federation of small businesses british chambers of commerce and institute of directors along with the consultancy group pwc and a string of other business voices should all cry out for affordable flexible good childcare as more women are forced out of work by the breakdown in childcare employers urgently need those million missing women back in their workforce childcare failure alone costs upwards of bn or of gdp says the centre for progressive policy after arriving in the commons seven months pregnant in harriet harman was greeted by hoots of derision when she asked her first question to margaret thatcher asking about the lack of childcare provision in school holidays as most parents work to support their families thatcher replied no i do not believe that it is up to the government to provide care for schoolchildren during the school holidays harperson as she was mockingly called was shaken but undeterred by contempt from her own side too childcare was not real politics it is now though her motives were primarily feminist harman as social security secretary persuaded gordon brown that childcare was also a necessity to get single mothers off benefits and into work later he and the labour party which had declared education education education a key objective embraced sure start an ambitious social programme pursuing labour values of social justice and equality the shadow education secretary bridget phillipson in a speech made on thursday to the conservative thinktank onward took on the current childcare collapse and again turned labours future early years ambitions into something far more than merely providing a holding pen for children while mothers work her promise is for a new childcare system to provide affordable nurseries from the end of parental leave right through to the end of primary school including holidays that would be lifetransforming for millions of families desperately struggling and juggling and it would indeed send a flood of able people back into the workforce she begins with a small promise of free breakfast clubs for every primary school in england getting hungry children ready to learn but she will unfold the rest and how it will be paid for as labour calculates its budget before the election they cant do everything everywhere all at once but they can spell out the direction of travel and the steps to get there i was at pen green last year when phillipson visited as part of her tour of the best childcare and nursery education programmes across the world she has been to estonia where parents pay just a month for nurseries staffed entirely by graduates and to australia where labor won the elections with ambitious childcare policies early years she said will be my first priority promising a big increase in pen greenstyle statemaintained nurseries she means it at sure starts peak in there were centres based on incontrovertible evidence that earliest years matter most the rest is catchup in a country with a stubborn gap in education achievement between least and most deprived places in phillipsons analysis sure start failed politically to embed itself beyond the reach of hostile future tory governments unlike the nhs which no tories have dared to try to abolish not next time she says phillipson is eating the tories lunch claiming that labour is now the party of the family it hardly needs saying after the mammoth destruction of childrens support began with george osbornes first childeating budget cutting deep into schools childrens arts sports health visitors school nurses and more when labour has to make spending choices phillipson will argue for youngest children first before social care and health i would urge if keir starmers message is to aim high for the future that takes political determination as childrens centres true results arrive far beyond one electoral term no doubt in the budget the chancellor will bung extra cash into childcare and its phoney free hours funding but that wont fix a profoundly broken system polly toynbee is a guardian columnist,2023-03,awardwinning childrens centre corby

ministers are considering allowing parents on universal credit to claim back more cash on childcare as a way of easing rising cost of living pressures the governments childcare offer is also expected to help boost the number of childminders by making it easier for them to register with agencies rather than signing up via ofsted the change which would be part of the spring budget next week could be accompanied by a reported restructure of universal credit to allow upfront payments for childcare parents are currently forced to pay costs upfront before being reimbursed whitehall sources suggested there was a preference to focus on allowing parents on universal credit to claim back more money on childcare costs uc claimants can receive of costs but these have been capped since equivalent to a realterms cut of the maximum that can be claimed is per child and for two children but the chancellor jeremy hunt is considering raising that cap if costs had kept pace with inflation they would be close to and respectively according to the institute for fiscal studies thinktank mps have also campaigned for the poorest families on universal credit to have their childcare costs paid up front rather than being reimbursed by the department for work and pensions once a month but treasury sources suggested there were risks including overpayments involved in changing the approach analysis from the ifs said lifting the cap would help fewer families than some other changes because the take up of paid childcare was low and many families did not claim exceeding the cap the ifs also said it was clearly an issue for many families that childcare was paid by the dwp in arrears which it said would create a barrier for families who want to work but lack the disposable cash to pay for a months childcare costs out of pocket though said there was risk of overpayments the work and pensions secretary mel stride hinted he was considering changes to the cap in exchanges with labours jonathan ashworth last week in the commons ashworth said many women are blocked from returning to work because of childcare costs given that we should be doing more to help parents move into work why has he now frozen the childcare cost cap in universal credit for the seventh year in a row stride said the government would come forward with measures and no doubt we will have something to say about the matter he has raised other key reforms which have been pushed by education ministers include changes to childminder registrations to make it easier for new childminders to enter the market plans which were put out to consultation last year included reducing the upfront costs of becoming a childminder as well as making the registration process easier industry leaders who have met ministers have asked for new money to allow agencies rather than ofsted to register childminders which can be an onerous and lengthy process,2023-03,minister considering allowing parent universal credit claim back

before i even went to my first scan my unborn babys name was down on a nursery waiting list says laura williams this was her second child and it had taken months to find a nursery spot for her first daughter forcing her to take time off work she had put in a request at five months pregnant but the waiting list had been a year long thats crazy seeing as a pregnancy is only nine months she says its a story that is playing out across england a shortage of childcare places coupled with the huge costs of nurseries means women are questioning whether they should go back to work only half of councils in england have sufficient childcare places to meet the demand of parents working fulltime down from in according to coramthe survey also found that a parttime place hours a week for a child under two in nursery now costs an average of per week williams whose girls are now three and months is from beverley a market town in the east riding of yorkshire there is very little childcare in the area she says the nursery we got into is on a farm so it is spacious and fairly small there are two other options near us one of them has a maximum of babies in their room so it is overcrowded and felt like not a nice environment the other is a preschool so they can only join from two or three years all the rest are childminders the cost of it all is crippling the fee of a month is significantly more than the familys mortgage what is the point in going back to work when it is cheaper to not work at all she says adding that the costs have recently increased from to a day the rises are due to the cost of living and inflation with food heating and employee wages all going up williams is eligible for hours of free childcare but says it is difficult to use because you have to pay for wraparound care that is if you want to drop them off before am or collect after pm which we do as we are teachers we earn what we earn and it keeps us going but dont have any spending money part of it is our choice to have kids earlier but where is the incentive for women to go back to work meg pattern from aldridge near walsall in the west midlands also looked for a nursery place when she was in early pregnancy the lead time would have been a year and a half she says her son is now months old and the nursery they found is a minute drive away which she says is a bit of a nightmare there is not much choice she says the nursery we have got him in at the moment has got some issues they have a gas boiler downstairs and ive spoken to other parents who have been complaining about it for weeks because there is a smell of oil to consider nursery before you even have a child is a weird process because anything can happen the cost is huge so they can use the nursery only twice a week pattern a project manager says her parents take their son for two days and she dropped a day at work to look after him the cost for a nursery has gone up since we first spoke to them she says to be honest its putting us off having a second child because i want a quality of life and dont know what is happening to the cost of living pattern is realistic and says she realises that extra government money for childcare has to come from somewhere but she says studies have shown that supporting women means more can work which will boost the economy it stresses me out because i worry about the future she says and maternity pay for a lot of people is ridiculous it is stressful everything has shot up evie storey can relate to all these concerns although it is not just nursery places that are hard to find based in newcastle she has struggled to find her little girl a childminder other mothers have had issues and post about it on facebook she says she cannot afford nursery and has found it stressful finding

the scale of the childcare crisis in england has been exposed by new data showing some parents face spending as much as of their takehome pay on childcare while others struggle to find a provider because of supply gaps in large parts of the country a study by the thinktank nesta seen by the guardian shows how hard it is for families in different parts of england to afford to pay for someone to look after their children while they work meanwhile two other studies one by the childrens charity coram and one by the labour party show there are insufficient places in half of the countrys local authorities with demand now more than double the countrys supply labour will pledge to overhaul the governments flagship scheme on thursday promising parents of young children hours of free childcare a week if the party is elected at the next election the overhaul will come as part of a wider reform of the childcare subsidy regime which labour says is broken bridget phillipson the shadow education secretary will say in a speech on thursday the childcare model the conservatives have built fails everyone denying parents the ability to work the jobs theyd like to give their children the opportunities theyd like and is not of the quality that staff want to provide in the britain the conservatives will leave behind tweaking the system we have will not deliver the ambition or scale of reform we are going to need uk childcare costs have been rising for years and are now double the oecd average with a twoearner family now paying a third of their posttax income on securing a place for their child for a singleparent family on the minimum wage that figure is over twothirds the problem has triggered alarm in the treasury where ministers believe it is contributing to millions of people staying at home rather than entering the workplace and are working up plans to ease the crisis to be included in this months budget the guardian revealed last month that the education department had submitted proposals to the treasury that would massively expand the free hours scheme to cover all children aged nine months and older the study from nesta shows for the first time how affordability varies across england with families in london facing an especially bad crunch the figures show that a single parent earning the national minimum wage now has to pay about of their posttax income on childcare though that figure does not include the impact of benefits payments the four least affordable local authorities are all in london the data shows hammersmith and fulham kensington and chelsea camden and brent manchester is the fifth least affordable meanwhile a separate survey by coram of local authorities in england shows that only half say they have sufficient childcare places to meet the demand of parents working fulltime the proportion of councils reporting enough places to cover the demand of fulltime working parents has dropped from in to in and only of the councils said they have sufficient places for children under two down from a year ago there are now children for every childcare place in england with a decline in the number of providers since according to labours analysis of government figures corams research also shows that it is the most disadvantaged children who are at risk of missing out with less than one in five local authorities in england that answered the survey reporting sufficient childcare for children with disabilities a decrease of three percentage points compared with megan jarvie the head of coram family and childcare said the need

ireland to see how childcare funding works abroad labour officials say she was particularly impressed by the system in estonia where parents are offered a guaranteed place at kindergarten for all children aged between months and seven years at costs as low as a month a labour source said phillipson would say more about how labour would replace the free hours scheme in the coming months a government spokesperson said the number of childcare places available to families in england has remained broadly stable since and standards remain high with of providers rated good or outstanding we

last month my daughter got the flu days bled into miserable weeks of cancelled work and missed nursery as the virus hopped from her to my husband to me a groundhog day fever dream of bluey calpol syringes and animal crackers financially it was just as ruinous patchy earnings alongside the nursery fees we paid despite her being unable to attend left us at least in the red for the second time in three months in december three weeks of unexplained fever culminated in my daughters eardrum exploding a relief for all of us those calculations may look stark on the page but working families are now being expected to swallow gargantuan losses like this on a monthtomonth basis britains nursery fees are some of the most expensive in the world a fulltime place for a child under the age of two costs on average more than a year in the uk in london its at least a year average fees increased by between when david cameron took office and while average wages have largely stagnated if not fallen in real terms somehow parents today are expected to magic up an extra salary for the luxury of being able to work and thats without accounting for the baseline costs of raising feeding and clothing children forcing women to plug the holes in our gaping statecare offering with unpaid labour has its consequences the number of women aged to leaving work to look after family is rising at the sharpest rate for years according to ons data a new report by the consultancy firm pwc found the uk had slipped down the international league table for women in work by five places citing the motherhood penalty as the most significant driver of the gender gap three in four mothers who pay for childcare say it no longer makes financial sense for them to work according to pregnant then screwed im just trying to keep some skin in the game says a friend who after nursery fees and rent is barely breaking even and has had to reduce her hours extortionate fees are just one part of the problem of women using childcare think the government is not doing enough to support them inflexible hours a staffing and retention crisis childcare deserts yearslong waiting lists its hardly surprising that so many working women have already thrown in the towel in october tens of thousands of desperate parents took to the streets demanding action and yet political solutions to our childcare woes have been repeatedly kicked into the long grass the best option liz truss could come up with was reducing stafftochild ratios a wildly unpopular proposal among parents and providers alike over legitimate concerns it would undermine quality in early years settings england already has the lowest qualification requirements for its early years workers compared to australia canada japan new zealand and switzerland and pays the lowest wages despite evidence that higher quality providers inspire more positive outcomes rishi sunak is said to be considering other cost reduction measures for parents including adding an extra hoursaweek entitlement for working parents of children aged nine months to three years offering a smaller number of free hours for twoyearolds and an offer of free hours for disadvantaged oneyearolds how exactly our crumbling provision will accommodate those extra places is another question nursery workers are already leaving the sector in their droves providers squeezed by deliberate government underfunding for the best part of a decade are shutting up shop at the fastest rate in six years reducing costs for parents alone will just create more problems any plan to tackle britains broken childcare provision must first focus on repairing our ailing provision says joeli brearley founder of pregnant then screwed that means shoring up providers improving quality and attracting more talent to the sector admittedly this would require an upfront investment of billions of pounds a daunting sum to the chancellor jeremy hunt who is reportedly concerned about cost as he considers what the conservative government is prepared to stump up to fix this mess ahead of the spring budget but a chronic lack of vision is already costing us dearly in the uk mothers have been prevented from entering paid work due to a lack of suitable childcare have reduced their hours at work and have quit their jobs according to new figures from the centre for progressive policy enabling mothers to work the hours they want would generate upwards of bn in additional earnings a year it calculates an additional economic output equivalent to of uk gdp elsewhere savvy developed economies know this in quebec canada childcare is treated as critical infrastructure like schools or roads since its notforprofit model was introduced two decades ago costing parents around c a day of quebec women aged to are part of the workforce the highest percentage in the world according to pierre fortin an economist at the university of quebec the programme is paying for itself he said thanks to the extra tax generated and reduction in social benefits in new zealand childcare providers with a higher proportion of qualified staff receive higher rates of funding which drives up quality of education and staff wages and in turn reduces costs for parents in japan a similar system of incentivising higher quality care exists alongside free childcare for three to fiveyearolds in both countries where workers are highly qualified outcomes for children are overwhelmingly positive in australia childcare subsidy was introduced in a meanstested benefit to help families cover the cost of childcare a costbenefit analysis found a return of a for every a spent on preschool education european neighbours such as sweden pay their childcare workers a healthy wage attracting a steady stream of talent to the sector another pwc study found that the uk would see a bn boost to its annual gross domestic product by increasing the female employment rate to that of sweden in germany children have a legal right to childcare and prices range from to per child a month in france statefunded creche places are offered to all children from two months old norway offers kindergarten to children between one and five with the cost linked to your income in luxembourg the government provides up to hours free a week and subsidised care for all children aged between one and four in estonia parents are guaranteed a nursery place for children from the age of months for a nominal cost what these schemes have in common is heavy state investment labours plan to finance statefunded nurseries if it wins the next election looks promising currently of early years providers are private businesses leaving parents vulnerable to inconsistent quality and sudden gaps in provision if they close their doors many have already done so if the harsh reality of life as a working mother doesnt stir you or the economic argument for investment in the early years sector isnt persuasive enough then what about the reams of evidence on childhood development that has shown time and time again that education in our early years dictates future outcomes our dismissal of early years settings as glorified holding pens where children can be supervised ignores the fact that quality childcare is really about education in the formative years with all its transformative potential almost half of the attainment gap at age is already in place before children start school and a childs development by months serves as a strong predictor of educational outcomes at age how can anyone

were detained nicole jacobs the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales said it is extremely concerning to see these statistics that show that every police force has shared details from migrant survivors of domestic abuse with immigration officials this puts victims in danger forcing them to either stay with abusers opt for destitution or face being deported senior police sources said forces felt under pressure from the government which is struggling to clamp down on immigration the national police chiefs council lead for immigration crime jim pearce an assistant chief constable said police should never check a database only to establish a victims immigration status if an officer becomes aware that a victim of crime is suspected of being an illegal immigrant it is right that they should raise this with immigration enforcement officers and not take any immigration enforcement action themselves throughout the police should treat them as a victim of crime lara ten caten of liberty which together with southall black sisters has formally challenged the policy said it was part of the governments racist hostile environment and added in the police inspectorate said that there was no evidence that sharing of personal victim data between the police and the home office supports safeguarding of victims of domestic abuse the police ignored the inspectorates recommendation and continued to share the data of domestic abuse victims with the home office putting victims at risk of deportation if they speak out the conservative mp sir bob neill said it was regrettable that the government was not willing to accept a recommendation by the justice select committee which he chairs for a firewall in such cases there is a real risk otherwise that this becomes prevalent and well known and victims of crime will not report offences he said its quite wrong to pass on immigration status when someone is the victim of violence domestic abuse trafficking anything of that kind its making them victims twice over it may well be that the immigration breach is trivial compared with the crime a home office spokesperson said we are committed to supporting all victims of domestic abuse regardless of their immigration status following a review into datasharing arrangements between policing and immigration enforcement it was concluded that a firewall is not an

is deciding whether to allow the home in bolton to reopen after the local council which cannot legally block the move raised concerns with the inspectorate boltons director of childrens services said the case raised deep concerns about the residential care sector alison mcguinness is the mother of robert mcguinness a lamborghinidriving onetime pub landlord who was exposed by the guardian last year for spending thousands of pounds intended for educating marginalised children on drinking foreign trips and his pub business together with roberts father francis the mcguinnesses ran achieve care homes they operated a home in bolton which ofsted closed in january last year after inspectors found that very inexperienced staff failed to meet childrens basic care needs staff had not entered one bedroom for more than four months despite evidence of flies and a pungent smell that spread throughout the home ofsted inspectors discovered alison mcguinness has started a new company called strive services which has applied to reopen the bolton home under a different name according to the strive website moses gate house is awaiting ofsted registration and will be a therapeutic childrens residential home providing placements for up to two children aged yrs bolton council has written to ofsted about strives mcguinness connection saying it will not be placing children there ofsted said it could not comment on individual cases but that all applications for registration are subject to a rigorous assessment of suitability including full checks of applicants background experience and knowledge and a visit from inspectors kate obrien the director of care and operations at strive services said strive is liaising transparently with bolton council in relation to the process they normally follow when a company wishes to provide services of this type strive is working with bolton council and ofsted to achieve a positive outcome for all concerned she declined to answer a series of questions including whether alison mcguinness had started a new company so that ofsted would not realise that some of the same people were involved in trying to reopen the bolton home mcguinness did not provide any comments of her own as well as running achieve care homes robert mcguinness and his father also ran a community interest company cic called achieve training centre which provided vocational training to children excluded from mainstream schools a guardian investigation found that bolton and bury local authorities paid m to the cic between and profits from the cic should have

to spain portugal belgium and thailand although robert mcguinness is not listed as a director of strive when the guardian contacted the company for a comment his lawyer replied the lawyer said robert mcguinness had paid back the money in full and that at its highest achieve helped cashflow of the pub business bernie brown the director of childrens services at bolton council said the case showed why the process for registering childrens homes needed to be more joined up the current system involves ofsted social services and local planning authorities at various stages but with limited coordination between the different agencies she said a national review is required to enable regulators planners and carers to work more closely together in deciding who should be allowed to register homes where they should be and which children should be placed there she said there were many excellent childrens homes run by both private companies and local authorities but she considers the current regulatory landscape problematic and wants the law changed to close a loophole in planning laws that allows providers to apply for change of use and open a home with limited experience this is deeply concerning especially while quality placements remain so scarce she said though bolton council says it will not place children with strive neighbouring bury council said it was already working

i race to the nursery to pick up my daughter according to her minder she has sticky eyes and i jaunt from soho to walthamstow to remove her from the group conjunctivitis is an annoying eye infection that is relatively minor moderately disgusting and highly infectious i am thrown back into the highoctane paranoia of the lockdown era arriving to find she has been happily sequestered from her friends in an attempt to contain her nascent plague part of me wonders why this is one of those infections thats so minor but so dangerous at once but i reckon its best not to overthink it since i am one of the few human beings who did not exit the lockdown with an associate degree in armchair virology nursery workers help us keep distance by standing between the children and myself on the understanding that id ordinarily think nothing of grabbing each of their eyeballs in turn and giving them a good rub no such fun this morning no today i must stay home stay safe save eyes we traipse the short walk to the house she miserable me tense she rubs gunk out of and into her eyes and i settle in for at least a day of clearing my work schedule and sequestering myself from people with children i hold her on my chest and position myself with wipes at arms reach the latter are essential as her eyes and nose ooze snot at all times like suds from a squeezed sponge i dont want to overdo the imagery on this you may be eating or contemplating having a child and i fear going into much more detail might pause either plan for some time but lets just say that applying pressure to any part of my daughters head right now would be like forcefully gripping a welly filled to the brim with green custard again best not to think about it within an hour she is comfortable and my clothes are ruined my shoulders arms and lap all laminated with a patina of mucus laid like a snails trail anywhere shes rested her sleepy face the sleepiness is at least one benefit to this ordeal since she lolls her comically large head in fitful bursts of slumber aversion but spends most of the hours after i pick her up in and out of consciousness we have eye drops which she hates and a warm cloth which she loathes my time is spent scrubbing away the disjecta that continuously accumulates carefully wiping at eyelashes which keep matting together in the manner of a cows tail i evidently never do this carefully enough and she reacts every single time as if im using sandpaper to rub bleach into her eyes we continue this throughout the following two days and she appears to come round to the routine as the infection wanes she is much more like her happy self as we drop her back some days later bushy tailed and more importantly bright eyed she is welcomed warmly by her friends and a mixture of exhaustion and relief causes me to rub my eyes myself wincing slightly as i do so probably nothing i think as i walk away best not to overthink it did ye hear mammy died by samas oreilly is

released by market analysts nielsen bookscan which revealed a increase in the overall number of childrens books sold compared with though that number has fallen back by in the first months of this

keir starmer has vowed to make it his personal mission to stand up for victims of domestic violence after a collapse in the number of charges brought for the crime the labour leader said that as the director of public prosecutions he had witnessed the devastating impact domestic violence has on victims and their families and how abuse often escalated into other forms of serious violence speaking at a conference held by the domestic abuse charity womens aid starmer promised to use his own experience to crack down on the crime and said labour would create a domestic abuse register for abusers convicted of serial domestic abuse and stalking he also promised the party would end the postcode lottery faced by victims by putting rape and domestic abuse specialists in every police force in england and wales and would install domestic abuse specialists in control rooms at peak times labour has also promised tougher sentences for rape stalking and domestic murder including a minimum sentence for rape of seven years and wholelife tariffs for rape abduction and murder as well as fasttracking for rape cases reports of domestic abuse have risen rapidly in the past decade and are up almost on figures crime figures from the office for national statistics show that more than cases were recorded in the year ending september a significant increase from the recorded between april and march despite the increase the number of people charged for domestic abuse has almost halved since and the number of victims dropping out of cases has increased when cases do move to trial theyre delayed for years because of backlogs in the courts said starmer ive seen firsthand the toll it takes on victims to wait for justice its not only unjust and unfair its harmful this government is completely missing in action millions are left paying the price it frustrates me and i want to fix it the labour leader highlighted the action he took to tackle violence against women and girls as dpp including his support for the introduction of janes law in the law which allows the crown prosecution service to appeal against the bailing of defendants was supported by starmer in response to the murder of jane clough an aampe nurse who was stabbed times by her violent expartner while he was awaiting trial for her rape in starmer said he would always have profound respect for her parents john and penny who campaigned for the change jane her daughter her parents and all who knew her were horribly let down by the system tackling violence against women and girls is deeply personal for me starmer said its why safer streets will be one of the core missions of my labour government its completely intolerable that of sexual abuse victims never saw a charge against their attacker last year i was so shocked when i was told the figure that i asked my team to check it sadly its true on tuesday the labour leader shared a stage with victoria derbyshire and former spice girl melanie brown who has talked about the abuse she suffered in her marriage at the conference held by womens aid starmer said it was inexcusable that fewer abusers were being prosecuted and convicted for their crimes our criminal justice system has been left broken and no longer serves the victims it is designed to protect he said with my labour government victims will be put back at the heart our system so they dont have to wait years for justice and are better supported by the police and authorities when they bravely report their abuser,2023-03,keir starmer ha vowed make personal mission stand victim domestic

one of the uks largest forprofit care chains has been accused of failing dozens of vulnerable children by shutting residential homes with staff warning they are struggling to find placements for all the children outcomes first group which is owned by private equity firm stirling square is planning to close a string of childrens homes across the midlands and southern england by may the homes are understood to accommodate more than children placed in the care of the private group by councils including bristol cheshire and enfield in london a whistleblower with knowledge of some of the threatened homes said she felt closures would be harmful and disruptive for children who could be moved to larger homes run by the group or even returned to councils if places cannot be found its dreadful the children have built relationships with the staff they have got schools they are getting therapy and now they have to move somewhere else she said its incredibly damaging for them the private group which is the fourth largest provider of residential places for lookedafter children in england made a profit of m in up from m the year before this comes amid growing concerns about the sudden largescale closure of homes run by private firms which over the past three decades have largely taken over childrens residential care in the uk regulators have warned councils might have to step in and find placements that could be a poor fit for childrens needs at least seven of outcomes firsts homes at risk of closure are rated good or outstanding by ofsted while two are rated inadequate the whistleblower claimed the chains smaller homes were being targeted for closure because they were not as profitable this is a prime example of why this ownership model should not be anywhere near childrens lives profits are driving this decision the latest ofsted report for one of the threatened homes which is rated outstanding says the staff provide a nurturing caring environment for the children with bedrooms and communal areas personalised with art photographs and achievements the report notes one childs sibling lives a short distance away in another childrens home so they can stay in touch one staff member said that they have been told they have to be out this week even though they have not found anywhere for the children there are no placements for any of them to go to we have been told that there is no leeway on the dates and we are desperately worried about them and what will become of them the moves would make children feel more insecure claimed the staff member we have children who we have built good trusting relationships with what are they going to think when we have to tell them how will they ever feel secure in their next placement being in care is meant to help them not make things worse some of the children include those due to start gcses siblings living in nearby homes who could be split up and a recently settled fouryearold a manager said they had been on group calls trying to find placements its felt like people are bidding on our kids its been horrible if the children have difficulties or have lots of risks then no one wants them said the manager we are going to have a situation where some can have transitions to new places but others will be left to the last minute because nobody wants them its heartbreaking chris wild a careexperienced member of the governments independent care review said childrens futures should not be at the mercy of market forces its repugnant that vulnerable kids can lose their homes because a private company decides the market conditions are unfavourable he said the government should step in their trauma will come back it will be absolutely devastating a spokesperson for outcomes first said we have made the difficult decision to close some homes to consolidate our services in light of the market challenges the homes are being offered for purchase as a priority to local authorities and alternatively other parties in the residential care sector full support has been provided for these children who are all being transitioned smoothly to other homes within the group or

women are increasingly being forced to engage in survival sex because of the cost of living crisis amid worsening conditions for britains most vulnerable charities warn that rising costs paired with years of underfunding mean women including those with trauma and mental health issues are having to turn to sex in exchange for housing or to meet other basic needs sex for rent when landlords demand sex in return for discounted or free accommodation is a growing problem as economic conditions tighten they said with perpetrators using it as a tool to abuse and control it is particularly an issue among migrant women and asylum seekers the observer understands the crisis is also making it harder for those trying to leave abusive relationships the beyond the streets charity said the cost of living crisis is driving those who are already vulnerable to turn to survival sex to meet the cost of bills and rent leading to increased exploitation and abuse a support worker for the charity said she had spoken to women who are trapped in escorting or selling sex and several who are having to top up lowwage jobs with sex in order to make ends meet a spokesperson for the charity said the cost of living crisis is a driver of survival sex and for those already vulnerable they face considerable exploitation there is a lack of government funding to support the needs of women and charities are struggling as their incomes reduce expenses increase and they are faced with more demands on their services latin american womens aid lawa has seen multiple cases of sex for rent in recent months involving female asylum seekers in one of the cases a woman had been sofasurfing for several months when she met a man who promised to provide her with accommodation before going on to sexually abuse her while she was sleeping beln ruiz the charitys violence against women and girls advice centre coordinator said it is unacceptable that women in such vulnerable circumstances are exposed so frequently to harassment and intimidation being doubly victimised and unable to seek redress some cases she added involved the harassment and abuse of asylum seekers while in public law accommodation

women are experiencing increased and exacerbated levels of controlling and financial abuse from perpetrators last week the home secretary suella braverman announced that she was considering a new law targeting landlords who exploit vulnerable people for sex and launched a call for evidence it came after the announcement last month of a trial of oneoff payments to help domestic abuse victims leave abusive relationships while hadley said the fund was a good first step the fund fell short of the m they had requested and the action on sex for rent was not tackling the root causes of the problem which she said were homelessness poverty and inequality a home office spokesperson said exploitation through sex for rent is already illegal under the sexual offences act the government recently launched a public call for evidence which brings us closer to ending this deeply harmful trend and better protecting victims we are committed to stopping all forms of violence and intimidation against women and girls including domestic abuse while we directly fund charities to help victims leave abusive relationships we also will invest over m more widely through our tackling domestic abuse

this morning i did something that i rarely do for fear of inducing a fullbody cringe the likes of which i have not experienced since aged i jumped on my dads back in the local swimming pool only to discover that it wasnt him i read one of my old columns written nearly a decade ago under the headline ill drink to childfree pubs and cafes my twentysomething self grumbles about the presence of kids in adult spaces fast forward and i have a oneyearold who regards my local pub as an extension of his living room i have sung him to sleep in the beer garden and breastfed him ros in hand while sharing birth stories sometimes i have looked up and seen an exclusion zone of empty tables around where we are sitting time makes hypocrites of us all there has been a lot of discussion about childfree spaces recently with two reported plane incidents going viral the first involved a pregnant woman being asked by cabin crew to clear up her childrens popcorn crumbs and the second a grown mans tantrum about the presence of a crying baby on his flight during which after his fellow passengers told him he was shouting he replied with the immortal so is the baby did that motherfucker pay extra to yell both provoked fierce debate online that can be boiled down to on the one hand crying babies are annoying and should not be in public being unable to soothe them is poor parenting v children and babies are a part of society and they also cry no one wants them to stop crying more than their own parents although these factions could broadly be categorised along the lines of childfreechildless people and childed people a word i dislike but one that is becoming increasingly popular many of us could see both sides i couldnt not laugh at the mans furious logic because i have felt that before and after becoming a parent but motherhood has elevated my already high threat responses to the point where a large angry man shouting at me and my baby in a confined space would almost certainly make me burst into tears not to mention frighten the poor child to intimidate babies and their mothers like that is unpleasant to say the least online parents and childfree people often seem to be at war offline however in my personal relationships things feel a lot more cordial perhaps because we love the people in our lives regardless of their reproductive status or perhaps because all the beef is simply simmering unarticulated under the surface since i became a parent ive been having discussions with friends and readers about what it means to live a childfree life they have made me think more deeply and empathically about how it feels to be part of a society where parenthood is the default journey when one does not have children my colleague helen pidds recent article about the childfree movement and its radical pioneering spirit as well as our series why i dont have a child added further to my understanding the decision to be childfree is not always painless and can feel lonely i can understand not always wanting to be reminded of that tough choice or having the desire to feel like youre enjoying life unencumbered parents benefit from childfree spaces too i love to read a book alone in a pub or cafe and my heart will sometimes sink at the sight of a crying baby when i have left my own at home for some vital alone time i dont take offence when people articulate a need for childfree spaces when a childfree yearold woman tells me that she doesnt really want to be around children all the time i get it but if you say that you have committed two massive unforgivable crimes not wanting kids what is wrong with you and then not wanting to at least be involved with kids you are a freak and must be a psychopath she says i tell her that i always try to ask my childfree friends whether i should bring the baby along or not hanging out with kids introduces all the elements i struggle with chaos noise endless tasks sometimes thats ok and its fun but i appreciate it when friends dont assume ill want to do that she says noting that you can never have a proper conversation with another adult when their child is around it brings to mind the phone call with marriedwithtoddlers magda in bridget joness diary bridget hi i was just ringing to say in the potty in the potty do it in the potty though the uk could be more childfriendly i do still believe in the sanctity of adultonly spaces that i argued for in my past column and to quote restaurant critic marina oloughlin children shouldnt rule the roost anywhere frankly but restaurants least of all ive endured too many longedfor carefully planned moments totally bollocksed by them i suppose it boils down to a need for kindness and empathy on both sides we all started life as babies screaming from colic or explosive diarrhoea babies cry as a way of communicating and being a part of humanity means that we cant always choose which other humans communicate with or around us but when theres an exit that isnt feet up in the sky parents can also choose to take their baby through it whats working ive long been a fan of tessa hadleys writing so it was great to reread sunstroke her short story

rishi sunak is being investigated over a potential breach of rules for failing to declare the financial interest of his wife akshata murthy in koru kids one of six childminder agencies that benefited from a policy change in last months budget whether or not sunak broke the rules by failing to declare his wifes interest will be decided by parliaments commissioner for standards but beneath this technocratic tale of government bureaucracy is a much deeper story about the depletion of britains childcare infrastructure over a decade of austerity the proliferation of childcare apps and the enrichment of those who have stepped in to fill gaps in provision koru kids is one of many digital sites to emerge in the past five years positioning themselves as technofixes to britains childcare crisis through their digital matching service these apps which also include bubble childcarecouk and carecom allow parents to book a childcare worker online by the hour bubble and childcarecouk lean more towards an ondemand model where parents can recruit a worker at short notice and sporadically others like koru kids focus more on regular arrangements similar to an agency but with less oversight they do not directly match workers with clients and are not responsible for the terms of the contract as any parent or guardian knows childcare in this country is unaffordable and often inaccessible local authorities have the power to provide cheap or free services but budget cuts mean that in practice provision is minimal only half of councils in england have enough childcare places to meet the demand of fulltime working parents while scotland and wales have slightly more free childcare provision it is still not enough to meet demand and the problem of staff retention and availability remains most parents have to turn to private providers instead and are at the mercy of the markets soaring prices the government provides some cash support for parents seeking private care provision through the hours free childcare scheme for weeks a year but this isnt enough given that provision is currently limited to three and fouryearolds when most parents go back to work after a maximum of one year of leave and work more than weeks a year the policy is to be extended to all children between nine months and five years old from september but that doesnt help in the present moment even those able to make full use of government provision still find themselves paying private providers to fill the gaps in the current system in this landscape childcare apps provide cheap convenient and accessible care which sounds ideal but the reality is that you get what you pay for to the detriment of workers children and their families during my research on appbased childcare i have spoken to dozens of nannies babysitters and childminders working on different platforms many share stories of precarity low wages and anxietyinducing worker surveillance via rating systems koru kids is the best of a bad bunch it does unlike some other platforms require the use of some form of contract and after costs workers are paid minimum wage thats less a credit to koru kids and more an indictment of the increasingly giglike conditions being normalised in the sector groups such as the nanny solidarity network are campaigning for better conditions but the fight is tough for such an unprotected workforce we know longterm relationshipbuilding is essential to a healthy care relationship but with the proliferation of ondemand apps and patchwork care models consistency is almost impossible children with physical and learning disabilities are especially impacted as many parents struggle to find consistent specialist care at an affordable rate in a marketplace model workers with special educational needs sen experience and expertise understandably charge more this cost should be covered by the government not by parents who happen to have children with sen platforms also do not guarantee the provision of sen workers you just have to hope someone happens to be available when you need them in my conversations with workers many described instances where they were hired to take care of a child with specialist needs despite not being equipped to do so sometimes parents were so desperate to find a carer they did not tell the worker beforehand the sad thing is the system does not need to be this way the relatively meagre amount of public money earmarked for childcare subsidises the activities of forprofit childcare companies this means that government money is going into the pockets of shareholders and directors whose priority is profit not provision and the profits are big britain has one of the most expensive childcare systems in the developed world costs for the average family have increased at three times the rate of wages since indeed the government scheme koru kids benefited from uses public money for cash incentives to get more childminders working for private providers countries like germany where childcare is not a forprofit commodity but a governmentprovided service show that an alternative is possible for as little as a month parents can access all manner of services childminders day nurseries afterschool clubs in britain that would not cover a week of the same provisions at one point it looked like we were heading in a different direction in the early s sure start centres delivered via local authorities provided free early years childcare for a minimum of hours a day to those most deprived areas for the rest of the country they provided breakfast clubs dropin sessions stay and plays and study support workers in these centres had job security and full employment rights however these provisions were never fully integrated into the public service system like say the nhs and so did not survive the austerity wave that was to come austerity has turned our essential care services into profitable markets to be exploited when talking about the undeclared interests that govern economic decisionmaking in this country the problem goes far deeper than one prime minister and one company the shared class interest between

my son is writing his first book hes not the first of our familys second generation to follow me in this path since outing myself as an author more than a few of my nephews and nieces have sought to outdo my efforts often with nervejangling success on a trip to worthing last month my nephew daniel sneered quite derisively when i told him it had taken me three years to write my book since hed written two that weekend alone my niece anna wrote a novel with the enviable title of two children millions of doors and good and evil that was jarringly readable while nineyearold oisin has spent the past year compiling lore for his similarly excellent deep fantasy series ice fire war ive had many conversations with them about their works because passing wisdom to the next generation is the least that should be expected of a famous author like myself and i can assure you that these interactions are a twoway street they keep me abreast of updates as they come in and i heavily imply that their lack of copyright means i can take their best ideas for my own work any time i choose theyre smart kids so they get it at four my sons adventures in writing have only just begun complicated slightly by his difficulty in getting ideas down on to the page a lot of this is logistical since his lefthandedness makes writing a bit fiddly and hes not yet fully committed to the horizontal lefttoright writing form typically taught in this part of the world unwilling to be blunted by convention his text goes up and down at will which i take to be a clever reference to the protoliterate forms of sumerian pictographs he also uses his bs ds ps and qs interchangeably which explains his books final page which features the enb in massive blue betters for the sake of legibility my wife takes on writing duties for the body of the text transcribing the words as he dictates and leaving him to draw illustrations below its her dads birthday so luckily me amp grandads biggest adventure is every bit the nonstop thrillride its title implies they saw fruits that they liked is its conspicuous opening line perhaps informed by the fact he was eating fruit at the time as i so often tell my students its important to write what you know then comes the striking next line they saw vegtable monsters the misspelling of vegetable is actually my wifes error but i am too distracted by the teethbaring veg below to tease her at the time and resolve to do so later in the national press then they went to outer space blares the following page replete with rocket ship aliens and planets and finally comes the conclusion they went to hook lighthouse this climax at a landmark on irelands southeast coast is a masterpiece in misdirection and a fitting tribute to his grandad who takes him there most summers more importantly it shows hes learned the true secret to any good story strip away all the fancy stuff and keep it simple all you really need is a beginning a middle and an enb did ye hear mammy died

for too many women and children male violence is a daily reality about million women are victims of domestic abuse each year and two women a week are killed by a current or former partner in england and wales it is vital that women get the support they need to leave abusive relationships yet new figures reported in the observer this week highlight that thousands of victims of domestic abuse are being turned down for safe accommodation leaving a coercively abusive relationship can be extremely difficult women are often cut off from other sources of financial and emotional support by their abusers they may be economically dependent on their abusive partner as a result of financial control the point at which a woman leaves an abusive relationship is often one of heightened danger there is an increase in the risk of violence after separation while men are also victims of domestic abuse and it is important that they too can access specialist support female victims are much more likely to experience repeated and severe forms of abuse including sexual violence and sustained physical psychological or emotional abuse and violence that results in injury or death it is therefore vital that women looking to leave abusive relationships can access specialist residential support if needed this is why the domestic abuse act an important piece of legislation that for the first time set out a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes emotional and economic abuse and coercive control placed a new duty on local authorities to provide accommodationbased support to victims of domestic abuse and their children a legal duty is only as good however as councils ability to fulfil it the most appropriate support for women leaving abusive relationships will often be refuges run by women for women which combine accommodation safe from abusive former partners who will sometimes go to great lengths to try to track down the women who have left them with support services such as group counselling and therapy to help them rebuild their lives the first womens refuge was opened in chiswick west london in with a commitment that it would turn away no woman in need other grassroots refuges were opened by women across the country in the years that followed often run on a shoestring in doneup squats or dilapidated housing that they persuaded councils to hand over over the next few decades refuges increasingly came to be funded by local councils in recognition of the fact that they remain a vital service in every community afflicted by violence behind closed doors but since the funding landscape has become much harsher as a result of local government funding cuts and commissioning practices that favour scale over specialism and tend to disadvantage the grassroots organisations run by women for women that survivors of domestic abuse and their children need now the first annual progress report from the steering group set up to monitor how councils are meeting their legal duty exposes the gap between need and provision it reveals that more than women escaping domestic abuse were refused safe housing almost of those refusals were due to a lack of capacity in safe accommodation services and more than because a service could not meet needs such as mental health issues drug or alcohol use or disability this is likely to be an underestimate as organisations may not refer women who need a refuge space if they already know nowhere is available there are likely to be particular gaps around specialist services as well for black and minority ethnic women and lgbtq people migrant women with no recourse to public funds are extremely vulnerable because they cannot access statutory support as a result of their immigration status leaving them trapped in dangerous situations they are put off seeking police help in case it leads to deportation and separation from their children their abusers know this and use it as an additional means of control the government has allocated a total of m over the next two years to help councils meet their duty to provide accommodationbased support for victims of domestic abuse this is clearly not enough the charity womens aid has calculated that it would take three times this amount to adequately meet need this underresourcing of refuge services is just one example of a dismal societal failure to take male violence against women and children seriously enough more than women are murdered a year by men in the uk yet evidencebased programmes to prevent violence against women and children are given a fraction of the funding spent on preventing terrorism prosecution rates for rape are so low that sexual violence has effectively become almost decriminalised in light of evidence that growing up around domestic abuse alcohol and substance abuse or having a father in prison is associated with a higher propensity to violence in boys as they grow up we need far more investment in breaking the intergenerational cycle of male violence through services that support children experiencing such family trauma we remain a long way off a society where women and children are safe from male violence

more than women escaping domestic abuse across england were refused safe housing last year amid warnings that many could be left homeless or driven back to dangerous partners as a result of a woeful lack of safe accommodation official figures seen by the observer found that almost households referred to a safe accommodation service did not receive support because there was no capacity a further were denied places because the shelter could not meet the needs of the household with figures suggesting this was often due to mental health issues drug and alcohol use or disability the concerning figures emerge in the first report by a group set up to monitor progress under landmark laws designed to protect victims of domestic abuse and improve their access to help nicole jacobs the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales said it was now vital that service capacity is strengthened jess phillips labours shadow minister for domestic violence said the figures were a clear indicator that more needs to be done and that legal duties to provide help for those escaping violence were not yet being fulfilled the government must produce a clear plan on their response to the amount of victims turned away and clarity on the standards expected of safe accommodation she said sadly too many of those who are being housed are absolutely not in specialist safe secure supportive accommodation but instead in unregulated sometimes dangerous accommodation the government should not crow about how much they claim to be doing in this space while the data still looks so woeful the figures were published in the first annual progress report from the domestic abuse safe accommodation national expert steering group which was set up to monitor how councils are meeting their duties under the domestic abuse act of while the steering group did not analyse the gender of those who were refused support of the adults who were able to secure safe housing were women the figures for households whose referrals were rejected may include some who later found support elsewhere however the figures exclude people who were not referred to safe accommodation in the first place because their council knew there was nowhere available for them anyone whos facing domestic abuse and who is not assisted to enter safe accommodation is at such huge risk the consequences are that theyre exploited and abused on the streets or they are driven back in an abusive relationship said hannana siddiqui head of policy campaigns and research at the womens rights group southall black sisters if theyre not provided with proper housing and support for themselves and their children then what choices have they got left a lot of them are very low income or no income christine jardine liberal democrat spokesperson for women and equalities said womens aid organisations across the country have been ringing alarm bells for far too long that the government has been failing to provide the vital funding they need this report highlights the inner failings of the treatment of victims of domestic abuse and the government should now match their warm words about supporting survivors with the funding for more refuge spaces the report also highlighted a lack of specialist provision for ethnic minority disabled lgbtq and male domestic abuse victims as well as those needing mental health or drug and alcohol support there is also a dearth of places that will accept migrants unable to claim state support leni morris chief executive of the lgbt antiabuse charity galop said we see lgbt victims of abuse having to choose between staying in dangerous abusive situations or risking street homelessness we often spend days trying to find accommodation for people we work with sometimes for that person to arrive at that refuge space and face homophobia or transphobia from other residents and have to flee again sophie franciscansfield public affairs manager at womens aid said we share concerns about the number of instances highlighted in this report where a survivor is turned away from a service due to capacity we know its not only refuges struggling to keep doors open but also counselling resettlement advice and services for children due to the lack of funding for these vital services the progress report said at least adults and children were supported in commissioned safe accommodation services but data issues mean the true figure will be higher a spokesperson for the department for levelling up housing and communities said it is absolutely critical that victims of domestic abuse get support especially when they are in housing need the domestic abuse act placed a duty upon councils to provide safe accommodation and we have been clear they must consider the specific needs of all victims since april we have provided m to councils across england to make sure safe accommodation spaces such as refuges can provide victims with support services including counselling and therapy children support and advocacy support to access healthcare social workers and benefits we have committed a further m in funding for the delivery of these duties over the next

nora is still running but the finish line is in sight the boys have not yet noticed theyve been outplayed but theyre about to witness the kind of soaring moral fable that any parent dreams of were minding my niblings ardal and nora while my sister maeve and her husband jimmy are enjoying a boujie weekend in margate since we moved close to them last year our son has become enraptured with his cousins who are only slightly older than him owing partly to their proximity in age and partly to maeve and jimmys foolhardy habit of inviting us over for dinner most sundays hes come to think of them as cousinsiblings and their friendship has been a delight maeve and i grew up in a family of so our own childhood was a bustling metropolis of infant interaction filled with noise and games and the kinds of fights children can only really have with siblings the kind where you can draw blood by throwing the pointy end of a vhs tape at your sisters head sorry caoimhe but seconds later conspire to keep it a secret from your dad so you can sit happily together and watch said tape itself grease there are many reasons why someone might not want to have a stupidly large amount of children both maeve and i have a rather sensible two apiece but big family dynamics do provide a speedrun of socialisation that i sometimes regret my own two kids wont have so im delighted they can approximate it now and i do mean now since we are currently spending an entire weekend with four kids its intense but thankfully they manage to keep each other occupied for the most part after a morning in the park we go to the indoor trampoline centre and thence to the running track out back to see who can get to the end quickest and hopefully most tired ardal begins in earnest faster than the younger two by a country mile my son whose stiff robotic gait is an eternal delight to us if not to the selection committee for the irish athletics federation decides his best bet is to cheat and bisects the central concourse in the hopes of halving his journey drawing the eternally competitive ardal to overtake him while doing the same only nora stays the legal course refusing to compromise the integrity of the sport while her two siblingcousins squabble over their tactics theyve already made up and are playing another game entirely redfaced some minutes later as noras tiny form reappears near the finish and the boys realise she and only she is in place to win as she crosses the line we chant her name delighted that our rakish hares have been defeated by a smart little nortoise we get home sweaty but

the twochild limit for uk benefits is now affecting million children with more than a million of them growing up in poverty a campaign group has said in a report into what it termed this nastiest of policies the cumulative impact of the limit which means that parents cannot claim child tax credit or universal credit for any third or subsequent child born after april meant it could eventually affect about million children with families losing out on up to a year the study found the report into the scheme six years after it began carried out by the child poverty action group cpag and supported by the church of england among others said the impact had been exacerbated further by the wider cost of living crisis submissions from plus parents who have taken part in an ongoing cpag survey about the twochild limit found that in the last year many more families had struggled to pay for power bills and food individual testimonies from some of those affected include parents missing meals children unable to join school clubs and outings and women who feel forced to return to work when their babies are only a few months old one woman said she very rarely bathed or read bedtime stories to her three and fouryearold children because her local supermarket tended to discount food at pm its a treat if mummy is doing it because usually mummys gone shopping she said its hard and its horrible while ministers bill the limit as a fair way to ensure people take financial responsibility for their family decisions cpag said there was no evidence it had affected fertility rates and that it simply pushed huge numbers of children into poverty something which has been shown to affect longterm life chances abolishing the limit would cost bn a year the report said and would lift children out of poverty with a further in less deep poverty according to cpags calculations the limit now hits million children million of whom are in poverty with of families affected having someone in work the groups survey showed that of working families affected by the policy said it made it harder for them to pay for food during up from a year before the rate for nonworking households is for all affected families the proportion struggling with gas and electricity bills rose from to despite the governments intervention to limit bills the twochild limit has been a controversial policy because of its impact on poverty rates but also because of the socalled rape clause under which women can claim social security for a third or later child but only if they can demonstrate the child was conceived via rape alison garnham cpags chief executive said six years to the day since this nastiest of policies came into effect our survey is showing its devastating effects the twochild limit makes it impossible for parents to provide their children with essentials and the cost of living crisis is adding extra pain the number of children in poverty rose by last year and the twochild limit played a big part in that rise there is no place for this policy in a country that believes all children deserve a good start ministers must remove it before it does more damage to children and to family life a government spokesperson said the policy means families on benefits are asked to make the same financial decisions as families supporting themselves solely through work adding that there were careful exemptions and safeguards to protect those in the most vulnerable circumstances,2023-04,twochild limit uk benefit affecting million child million growing poverty campaign group ha said

some of britains most vulnerable children are being moved to care homes more than miles away from the neighbourhoods they grew up in according to an observer investigation revealing a national scandal the shocking figures make clear for the first time the scale of the crisis that has long worried child welfare experts they show dozens of children from london alone are in foster or care homes more than miles from the city as councils battle a significant shortfall in provision children from the capital have been placed in homes near perth glasgow knowsley leeds and carlisle care experts said that the pattern is being repeated across the country removing children from critical support networks and familiar surroundings about children from london are in foster or residential care more than miles from their home neighbourhoods councils have warned they often have to compete for limited places and face rising costs and profiteering on the backs of vulnerable children some children need to be placed in certain locations for their own safety however there is widespread acceptance that the care system is failing to provide enough appropriate places in the right areas experts warn that relocating children removed them from schools friends and extended family as well as clubs and activities that were often key to their wellbeing they warned it also put some at greater risk of exploitation according to the observers findings uncovered using the freedom of information act at least children from the capital are placed more than miles away the figure is likely to be far higher as some councils did not reveal precise numbers at least are more than miles away john pearce from the association of directors of childrens services said the investigation highlighted a pressing and longstanding national issue that we continue to raise with the government a lack of local placements for the children in our care local authorities are working hard to overcome the sufficiency challenges they face he said but we need the support of the government to address the significant challenges we all face as well as rising costs and profiteering on the backs of vulnerable children clare bracey director of policy and campaigns at become a charity for care leavers and those still in care said being moved far from home left children lonely and isolated this is a national scandal and is getting worse she said there are sometimes reasons why these moves are necessary for the child but the reality is that for many children these moves are happening because there just are not enough suitable places for them to stay close to home they are being let down chris wild a care leaver who campaigns for more legal protections for care leavers said he knew of cases of children being moved several times a year i was in the care system years ago but from everything im seeing nothing has changed he said theres evidence these moves put them at greater risk of going missing ending up homeless or developing severe mental health issues an independent review of childrens social care last year revealed a system spiralling out of control recommending a fiveyear bn plan to improve it however ministers initially pledged just m over two years the government has since said it has added m to fund homes anne longfield the former childrens commissioner for england said the large distances involved were a symptom of a broken system i have heard so many horrific stories of teenagers who are moved far from home to places where they know nobody she said they then become easy pickings for those who want to exploit and abuse children the independent review of childrens social care published a year ago provided a roadmap to fixing this crisis however the governments halfhearted response and its failure to provide the levels of investment required means hundreds of vulnerable children will continue to be put at risk in places they cant even place on a map rachel de souza englands current childrens commissioner said she wanted to see particular attention paid to sibling groups those with mental health needs or disabilities or who live in custody for whom being placed large distances from their families and support networks can leave them without any of the positive relationships in their lives that other children take for granted all the london councils who spoke to the observer said the needs of the children were always their first priority and that cost was not the driver of any placements with some of the young people needing to be moved for their own safety they said keeping all children within their neighbourhoods was always the aim and that the vast majority of children were placed within their boroughs there are also several studies and plans under way to create more secure child care home places however many acknowledged the serious shortcomings hampering the system there is a crisis in the residential care home sector where a scarcity of places means that it can be extremely hard to find a suitable home for children especially if they have complex or specific needs said anntoinette bramble deputy mayor of hackney a greenwich borough council spokesperson said that a lack of sufficient placement options is a national issue for children in care marian james from sutton council said the independent review of childrens care recommended more funding for childrens social care which we wholeheartedly agree with along with reform of the childrens care system but we need to receive adequate funding to enable the whole of the review recommendations to be fully realised a department for education spokesperson said local authorities are responsible for placing looked after children and must look to make placements in the childs best interests which in most cases means a child is placed within miles of their home in addition to the m announced in march we are investing m to create more placements for children in highquality and safe homes we are also investing over m to recruit and retain more foster carers and are working to develop a new regional model of delivering care placements helping more children

the corporate takeover of childrens care has led to more children moving between shortterm unstable placements far away from their families according to research the oxford university study which drew on more than care records revealed outofarea placements in england can be attributed to the outsourcing of care to forprofit providers between and the research to be published on monday also shows growing private involvement in care provision has disrupted the lives of vulnerable children with higher rates of outsourcing linked to higher rates of placements breaking down within two years which is regarded as a benchmark of stability by the government our analysis shows that forprofit outsourcing is consistently associated with more children being placed out of area and placement instability said the studys coauthor dr anders bachmortensen from oxfords department for social policy and intervention and roskilde university over the last decade we see that these outcomes have deteriorated or stagnated while forprofit outsourcing have increased children taken into care can end up hundreds of miles from their communities and families jade barnett who grew up in london was sent to a private childrens home near blackpool lancashire when she was when i first found out i was moving i was angry because i had no say she said but then the anger turned to tears because it was not something i could control i cried all the way to blackpool in the cab barnett who tried to run away from the home twice felt isolated as she was one of the few black people in the largely white seaside resort she was stared at in the street and strangers touched her hair i felt like an alien she said there was no one to defend me no one had my back it made me feel uncomfortable it made me feel small like it was weird to be black the town which is ranked among the most deprived in the country was best avoided at night its what id call nitty central there were crackheads and alcoholics people would shout and scream she said it did not feel safe there are close to childrens homes in the blackpool area barnett who stayed in the home for less than two years feels many private providers are attracted to blackpool because property is cheap its down to money she said its so sad that money is more important than our wellbeing and journeys and our growth over the last three decades the private sector has almost completely taken over childrens residential care as local authorities have been encouraged by successive governments to outsource services now more than of homes in england are run to make a profit with large debtladen chains owned by private equity investors increasingly gobbling up smaller firms the governments independent review of social care found private providers often build residential childrens homes in parts of the country where property prices are cheapest to keep costs down and increase profit just over a quarter of all englands childrens homes are in the northwest more homes opened in the region than anywhere else in the country last year this trend has led to children in care having to move further and further away from their friends and communities nearly of all children placed in private provision were placed outside their local authority area compared with of children not in private provision in according to research by the charity become unlike the welsh and scottish governments uk ministers are not seeking to eliminate profitmaking from the care of children in england instead the governments reforms unveiled in february are focused on rebalancing the market by boosting commissioning power and providing capital funding for councils to build more homes the government has also ruled out a windfall tax on the firms making excessive profits in what regulators have described as a dysfunctional market ben goodair another of the studys authors said there was no evidence the private sector could improve the lives of children in care outsourcing and private sector involvement continue to be highlighted as promising avenues for local authorities to achieve better outcomes for children he said but our analysis suggests the opposite is true outsourcing is failing thousands of children previous research by the same oxford department has revealed forprofit childrens homes receive on average worse ofsted ratings and break more legal requirements than councilrun homes katharine sacksjones chief executive at become which represents children in care said it was alarming that a growing number of children in care are being made to move often without warning and sometimes multiple times a year this can have a devastating impact disrupting education and relationships including with brothers and sisters and leaving children feeling lonely and isolated she said she added capital funding for new homes which has been oversubscribed was completely inadequate a department for education spokesperson said local authorities have

naomi eisenstadt remembers her excitement as she started as the first director of the governments sure start unit in i felt like lyndon johnson had run up and asked me to set up head start she says referring to the us presidents key policy to fight the war on poverty for decades many women had been arguing with the government about what to do about early years and then blair and brown said yes lets do it that was extraordinary but as england and wales prepare for the biggest shakeup in early years in at least a decade after a massive extension to the free childcare hours for working parents her optimism for the nations children has gone i think the government values childcare but it doesnt value children she says there was nothing in the statement about children it was completely about the economy and thats a short term view because these children will be the workforce in years i am very anxious about the lack of attention on what childcare is actually for she points out that the number of nursery workers qualified to level has plummeted from of staff in to in i think we have to stop talking about more and start talking about better she says others have pointed out that the new free hours which are only available to working parents and not those in training or not in work risk exacerbating existing inequalities between children starting school research from coram family and childcare cfc and the joseph rowntree foundation jrf released last week has found the proposed investment risks worsening outcomes for disadvantaged children the sutton trust said of those eligible for the current hour offering are in the top half of earners compared with just of families in the bottom third it matters the charities argue having steadily decreased from to the attainment gap for fiveyearolds had increased back to levels by in of fiveyearolds in england who didnt qualify for free school meals had a good level of development compared with only of those that did the danger is that were missing an opportunity for cohorts of children who could benefit by a higher quality offer says eisenstadt this is completely counter to the idea of levelling up at its peak in sure start had centres and a bn budget before austerity cuts saw its budget cut by more than by june last year the number of full childrens centres had dropped to just with many offering much reduced services most of the centres dont exist any more in terms of what the original plan was says eisenstadt she is reflective about the programmes impact its first evaluation in found that while children of less disadvantaged families benefited those in the worst circumstances had more problems than before a followup in told a different story and found that in five out of outcomes sure start children did better than those not using the programme in research from the institute for fiscal studies found the policy had longterm benefits for childrens health which offset about a third of its cost and continued well beyond the end of the programme itself there was a real sense that things could change and they did sadly they have changed back she says but you know it doesnt mean what we did wasnt worthwhile for those families who used them at the time sure start got some things wrong she says it focused too much on making parents happy rather than what really benefited children but what grieves me is that we were learning so much while not hopeful she does at least think that some of the learning became baked in andrea leadsoms proposals for family hubs are the right idea she thinks even if they are too few and aiming them at yearolds is completely nuts while she points to increasing child poverty which is lower than years ago but has been rising since and the housing crisis as proof that the situation for children and young people has deteriorated she does think the dial has moved the fact that there will be something about the underfives in both political manifestos for the next election is a big change she says whether theyll be the right policies or not is another matter,2023-05,naomi eisenstadt remembers excitement started first director government sure start unit

for the past few weeks ive been taking my son to the playground or rather hes been taking me as its right beside his school and hes taken to running straight into it with the pace of a greased pig leaving me to chuff and bluster after him speed he likes to tell me is one of his main superpowers he has several now with strength and stamina close behind its his speed however which comes in most useful here since he knows that once hes through its gates i will be powerless to remove him there will be other parents present and the social conventions of parenting among strangers mean i will be too mortified to scream after him id be annoyed if i didnt find these trips so anthropologically compelling and if it didnt also give his baby sister a chance to crawl around the surface is soft and padded made not of that slightly spongy playground aggregate i knew growing up but an altogether more boingy substance covered in thick wispy fibres somewhere between artificial grass and cows fur together with the playgrounds cheerily undulating topography it gives the uncanny sense of walking over an unmade bed it is in short one of the few spaces on earth in which you could not perceive of a baby finding injury but this is balanced out by the fact it is usually filled with children whose spatial awareness and moral reluctance to stamping on babies heads could both be termed areas for improvement with one eye on her i make sure to observe her brother in the past year hes developed the first sticky filaments of a social life to watch him courting potential friends is thrilling and occasionally painful he has a simple process he just asks people to be his friend i dont mean in so many words i mean he literally approaches someone who looks fun and says can we be friends others do the same to him in turn and so propagates the daisy chain of companionship which prevails in the fouryearold population most kids say ok and run away instigating an impromptu game of tag that serves as the onboarding for this nascent friendship other times rarely but not so rarely that the spectre of several such incidents wont haunt me until the day i die i watch as wouldbe pals issue a terse no and return to whatever they were doing beforehand at this he fumbles with his fingers and moves on to the next person entirely unmoved he is in this sense hardier than i since i can barely watch such rejections without wanting to cry on his behalf watching its hard to tell what adults have actually gained from masking our true wants and needs with decades of ingrained repression and social performance would it not be better if we could all just approach anyone on the tube and ask to be their friend because they were wearing a cool hat i say this to parents i meet and they laugh in agreement sometimes they have cool hats but moral cowards that we are we do not pledge to be best friends instead as we watch our children do it a dozen times in as many minutes we silently envy their

like all children i hated rainy days what i didnt realise until i had my own baby was how my parents probably hated them too cooped up whingeing babies can make cooped up whingeing babies of their adult caregivers too get outside every day people tell you but you find yourself and the child all wrapped up and ready to go and standing in a doorway watching the showers come down in biblical sheets a study that found that british children spend less time outdoors than prison inmates started to make a little bit more sense i have sung a lot of singin in the rain this past winter and then spring but sometimes ive been crying on the inside i dont get seasonal affective disorder but by april my spirits were starting to feel low the weather feels personal now in a way that it never did before when i could hunker down with a book or a film or a glass of red wine and a record now stormy weather means trying to find endless entertainment for a baby who loves nothing more than being outside and watching the wind shake the leaves it couldnt have been more different than the spring we brought him into the world our postpartum euphoria as we walked him through sunlit streets long lunches of seafood pasta while he slept in the pram pink blossom falling like snowflakes on the day we registered his birth this year its been so wet that hes only just touched grass it got me thinking about how weather and climate radically alter our experience of parenting and the culture of parenthood depending on where on the planet we find ourselves before we had the baby we used to go to greece and in my s i spent a year living in italy in both cases i was always struck by the mediterranean attitude to parenting the children out playing far past british bedtime as their parents dined and socialised nearby i always felt that i wanted to be like that not least because a later bedtime surely means a more civilised wakeup time but as well as the weather its a challenge in a country that does not treat public space in the same way the piazza shapes parenting as it shapes many aspects of italian life the arctic survival parenting of sami reindeer herders is another example of how climate shapes family life children are taught independence from a young age as a way of building resilience in a hostile climate children choose when they eat and when they sleep curling up for a nap wherever they feel like it me and the children can nap on an allterrain vehicle snowmobile under a rain cover in a trailer or in our van a woman who married into a sami family told the bbc families dont follow a schedule the terms are set by the natural environment now that things have brightened up i have vowed to work towards helping my boy to learn to nap outside on a rug yesterday in the playground i met a portuguese nanny who had put her charge face down on a blanket on the large circular nest swing and covered her with a coat when i asked the woman how she had managed to get her to sleep so soundly her response indicated that a child refusing to nap was not really an option they sleep better outside she said scandinavians are inclined to agree theyre famous for leaving sleeping babies in prams in the street and will bundle them up and allow them to nap outside even in subzero temperatures nursery schools will put the children down in the garden the theory being that the children are less likely to catch viruses than if you have them all sharing the same room one piece of finnish research found that babies slept longer outdoors than indoors perhaps my countryside roots are manifesting in my resistance to being an urban indoor parent or perhaps being outside just feels more natural to me in an evolutionary sense we are supposed to be outdoors and just as how babies relax during movement speaks to our nomadic past there must be an atavistic desire to spend time in the open air in the climate emergency however outdoor parenting is going to become more challenging than ever as weather becomes more extreme the heatwave last summer when i took the baby out only in the early mornings and late evenings though it hit c by am gave me a glimpse of things to come will the next few decades see london become unlivable for the very young and the very old our architecture is not built for heat as it is in warmer countries and ill never forget the hellish week we spent breastfeeding under a fan stuck together by a film of sweat periodically i would sponge down both the baby and mackerel our poor panting cat with flannels cooled in the fridge we even considered putting him on mackerels special pet cooling mat society will need to adapt or british children will end up more cooped up than ever i am immensely privileged to live in a place where the local government has prioritised shaded playgrounds paddling pools and sprinkler areas so that all children regardless of whether they have access to a garden can enjoy the summer i cant wait to introduce him to the joy of water play but perhaps its time to think about a life that looks beyond the paddling pool to a closer engagement with nature in the meantime lets just hope the weather holds up whats working cheese as a vehicle for getting green veg into the baby like his mother who is frequently mocked by his father for always adding it to dishes for flavour the baby is a fromage fiend and will eat almost anything as long as it factors a friend uses a similar strategy but with desiccated coconut yes on everything including bolognese whats not this kid loves wiping his mouth on everything that isnt a cloth feeding him has turned into a race against time can you wipe his grubby chops before he launches himself at your lovely blouse or the nearest piece of furniture the answer is almost always no which is why the ottoman is covered in little rings of yoghurt rhiannon lucy cosslett is a guardian columnist and author do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article

radical reforms to the care system in wales are needed to address a shocking rise in the number of looked after children a welsh parliament committee has concluded the committee said the number of children in care was up by almost since while at the same time there were shortages of qualified social workers members of the senedds children young people and education committee said a series of radical reforms were needed to address the situation and strengthen the legal rights of young people in care their report alluded to the case of logan mwangi the fiveyearold boy murdered by his mother her partner and his stepson logan was killed shortly after the stepson craig mulligan moved into the family home after being in care five days before the killing in a decision likened by prosecutors to throwing a lit match into a powder keg the committees report said managing risk was a very difficult part of social workers jobs it added social workers are under pressure to protect children and they can get a lot of strong criticism if it is seen that they arent stepping in to remove a child from their birth parents early enough according to the report there are many more children in care in wales compared with england per in wales compared with in england in one of the south wales valley areas torfaen which includes the towns of pontypool and blaenavon there are per jayne bryant the chair of the committee said during an inquiry on children in care it had heard from many who were being let down many said they felt ignored and powerless with no say in the decisions that affected their lives she said now is the time for action these young people desperately need more support and the guarantee that support will be there for them by making it their legal right to access it the committee found that of staff in in childrens social care were agency workers and there were vacancies for social care staff it also discovered that fewer than one in five children will achieve five or more a to c grades at gcse including englishwelsh and maths and one in four careexperienced children will be homeless at the age of about a quarter of care experienced parents will have had at least one of their own children removed the committee is calling for more legal responsibilities to be placed on the local authorities and other public bodies that act as parents to these young people it is asking for a law that will require councils to calculate the maximum number of caseloads a childrens care social worker can safely manage a welsh government spokesperson said we are working with careexperienced children and young people to radically reform services to provide the very best support and protection and ensure they thrive when leaving care,2023-05,radical reform care system wale

if you read all of these columns you may have spotted a recurring theme watching old movies my mum got me in to because im scared shes going to die to this i would add another habit sharing music videos from my youth to get through the weekend alone with my primary schoolage child both ideas feed into the plot of petite maman cline sciammas beloved film in which a little girl befriends another girl of the same age in the woods behind her recently deceased grandmas house before discovering her playmate is actually her mother as a child sciammas film was very much on my mind one sunday evening while watching some old music videos with my daughter cj during one we come to an artist who stops cj in her tracks her she says i love her she is half delirious as i was too the first time i saw neneh cherry on tv when i was around cjs age so my daughter and i meet in the woods which in this case is the surrealist beach of her video for manchild its shoreline strung with laundry drying on a line and other things she recognises from our daily life but instead of nenehs wet hair still wrapped in a turban as i go into the world its mine and instead of handing the baby to a trusted friend before bursting into her rap verse i am sending her on a playdate when im trying to meet a deadline in the video neneh is maternal and caring but needs momentarily to let go when its time for her most demanding vocals styled by the punk iconoclast judy blame i could write a thesison the impact of nenehs style the heavy gold earrings the lycra cycling shorts the high top sneakers an earth mother who could feel the ground beneath her and a goddess who would take you higher at a pivotal age she became my template of how to be a grown woman in domestic life my daughter replays the moment when the baby is handed to the friend in the video its the artist barry kamen who features alongside nenehs real best friend chef andi oliver several times it thrills her to think the baby might be the pop star mabel who is nenehs youngest daughter in real life though its not true the baby is actually her middle daughter tyson her eldest naima is on a swing in the right corner of the screen but cj likes her version and sticks with it neneh cherry was born in stockholm but her parents moved to new york living in the same loft building as chris frantz and tina weymouth of talking heads her stepfather the jazz trumpeter don cherry took her along when he toured with the slits punk and new wave shaped her as much as hiphop and it may be that mashing of genres that meant she was never embraced in the labelobsessed us the way she was in europe transfixed by the slits front woman ari up and then by poly styrene of xray spex she dropped out of school at and headed to london buffalo stance the first single from her seminal debut album raw like sushi came out in and she famously danced in lycra to it while seven months pregnant on top of the pops it is an image seared into so many womens memories as it was for the swedish pop genius robyn who covered it for the versions when you consider that cherry has also duetted with youssou ndour and michael stipe i think there should be a word like schadenfreude for when people you hold in high esteem respect you back we watch a few more neneh cherry videos then emboldened i put on deeelite lady miss kier was also huge for me around that time but when i show her groove is in the heart cj finds it very frightening the mania qtips disembodied head floating in space the same had happened when i switched her from audrey hepburn shed watched roman holiday and sabrina times to marilyn monroe she could feel marilyns anxiety and asked me to turn it off right away maybe she saw the vulnerability to come with adolescence the woman being wanted without wanting the walls closing in girls look to female pop stars to understand what kind of woman are you going to be for neneh cherry in these videos everything is possible which then extends to us shes beautiful but not in a way that makes men want to hurt her i dont ever want my daughter to experience thoughts like this that neneh cherry has cycling shorts and trainers so if she needs to she can run away ive tried to track the brand of trainers she wears fila champion reebok as if that could be key to us staying safe or it could be that her heavy gold jewellery becomes a selfdefence weapon but she wouldnt need that because she can talk her way safe to form a connection with the craziest bleakest human she could escape neneh cherrys whole look her entire sound is if a woman could run at night with headphones on and not have to be afraid i dont know if she feels that way it may be as much something to dream into for her as it is for me writing these columns ive been trying to clarify as they say at the end of one particular step meeting what has been given us what has been taken and what has been left behind i wrote to cherry when i was she didnt reply which doesnt matter a good early lesson in putting prayers out to the heavens knowing there may not be a response just saying this matters to me and heres why is a ritual that creates motion ive carried her vibrations with me for three decades now my interpretation via cherry of what motherhood could be was naive but i want my daughter to see me still stretching for it the shape i make the muscles flexed as i move

the trade body that oversees childrens care homes has taken the unprecedented step of publicly berating a major private provider for jeopardising the wellbeing of young people in its care after it announced a string of home closures the observer revealed last month that englands fourth largest provider of residential places for lookedafter children outcomes first group was shutting care homes due to market challenges the controversial decision by the firm which is owned by private equity company stirling square has led to the uprooting of more than vulnerable children to other homes with some moved to other areas of the uk the childrens homes association which represents private providers as well as some councils and charities said outcomes first only gave local authorities a month to find new placements for children when there is a dire shortage of residential care spaces their decision to close the homes without sufficient notice for local authorities to protect the wellbeing of the young people in their care is unacceptable and falls woefully short of the standards expected of providers in this vital sector it said two more outcome first staff come forward last week with stories of traumatised children being shunted around the country a care worker told the observer that one child staying in a home in southeast england was sent to scotland the children were distraught a lot were very upset and clingy to the staff when some children are rejected they can then try to reject you that can lead to destructive behaviour and violent behaviour which we did experience he said it has been completely devastating for them another of the groups care workers said a child was moved from south yorkshire to london theres no one near her her family is in yorkshire she said the worker added that another child who had lived in the home for six years started selfharming and smashing plates the night before she was due to move out i was very close to calling the police because i couldnt control it unfortunately i started crying and i said im so sorry there is nothing i can do at that point she started to calm down and she was crying along with me through the early hours she said it was honestly one of the saddest things ive ever seen the workers claim they were given the news that the homes were shutting down and their jobs were at risk via a microsoft teams video link by a manager who looked like he was sitting in his car in a car park the children who were told later were given two weeks notice before the homes closed staff claim the association which does not include outcomes first as a member said the groups decision was unjustified despite our indepth knowledge of the financial and operational challenges affecting all providers we see no reason why such drastic action would be necessary or justifiable for any responsible properly run residential childcare organisation it said the firms profits increased to m in from m the year before but analysis of the groups most recent accounts by a private equity specialist suggests the group is highly indebted and facing sharply rising interest payments the group is paying close to in interest alone on m of debt which is due to be repaid in it also has m of loan notes m of variable loan notes and m of preference shares which are all accruing interest there are mounting concerns about the sudden largescale closure of homes run by private firms which have come to dominate the sector the competition and markets authority has warned that highly leveraged providers could start exiting the market when interest rates rise giving councils little time to place children in other homes outcomes first said it had been operating within the terms of its contracts with the local authorities we are unable to comment on individual cases no placement decision is made in isolation without the full agreement of the local authority and social worker transition plans were agreed by all parties said a spokesperson for the group where possible the group is redeploying staff at these homes to others within the organisation,2023-05,trade body oversees childrens care home ha taken unprecedented step

it is the job of our parents to worry concern seeps out in their texts as we make our way home at night they fret as we do things far less risky than anything they pulled when they were our age no matter how old you become their worry probably never stops not least when you announce youre going travelling without them often halfway across the world but nothing can replace setting off on your own for the first time so parents you must let us go ive always been a gap year advocate and while there were negotiations there was never a question at least in my mind that i was going it is a privilege to be able to call the world your oyster i worked and saved for years in the leadup helped by generous donations from slightly apprehensive family members at the pointy end many australians flock overseas after completing their final high school exams taking up gigs as tutors in schools across the uk going on adventures with friends or every mothers worst nightmare embarking on an alcoholfuelled contiki tour while soaring air fares have diminished the opportunity to travel for some teens even before cozzie livs became a buzzword for cost of living it was hard enough losing money in dollarpoundeuro conversions before having to face the fact that places such as poundland were now your friends and then came the pandemic crippling the gappie dreams of gen zs ready to find their way out from behind the screen i had lofty dreams of doing the camino de santiago the idea of me walking an km pilgrimage alone at in possibly inclement weather and with only a basic grasp on the language was quickly stamped out i am older wiser and fitter now and one day i will enjoy it far more instead for the first three months of my trip i au paired two spanish children one who had no interest in learning english unless chocolate was involved and the other who fulfilled every trope of a nineyearold too grown up to need a nanny they both cried when i left but it hadnt been an easy road adjusting to living in someone elses house was a culture shock in every sense it became the small things that confused me like the fact that spain seemingly goes without two of my main comforts in life tea and porridge there wasnt even a kettle in the house i stayed in i skyped mum a lot during that time riddled with what was definitely homesickness but i also relished in being minutes away from madrid and having every weekend free to travel the country i remember both aspects equally as fondly because even though i was halfway across the world i knew there was someone who wanted to know all about my day just as much as i want to tell it that and the fact i could complain about having to boil my water in the microwave being overseas as a young person are the times you learn flourish and find out what you love and hate when youre in a different time zone to home and have less access to to the internet you must make your own decisions you have to find ways to stretch your budget be responsible for where you sleep every night take a gamble of when to get off the bus decide what looks safe and what doesnt and sometimes though hopefully not too often get it all wrong when you eventually move out of home you may not find yourself as homesick i shed more tears in a hostel in bath than in my dorm room and making friends with strangers may help you strike up more scintillating conversation at university when you plan your next holiday you will remember its always good to have an oldfashioned map to hand just in case your phone dies and you might be inspired to learn a language so that you can ask more questions before being led astray parents talk about how nerveracking it is letting their children travel but many also express surprise when after their children fly the nest they talk to them more than they did when they lived in the same four walls its still nice to send postcards but every parent in the digital age can rest a little easier knowing we dont have to sit in internet cafes or find phone booths to send home an update just like knowing when to use the emergency credit card we know when to call you moreover we want to when there is a moment that will only excite you we will probably reroute to find a cafe with wifi so we can talk to you in real time when we triumph like when i was accused of fraud by a spanish train conductor for buying the wrong ticket fare and had to talk my way out of it challenging but not impossible as it turns out we will find a way to tell you that we were in fact in control the whole time it may be a cliche but finding yourself is undoubtedly something that going it alone is guaranteed to give you be it a weekend a month or a year hit the road parents may have the toughest job in the world and we cannot rob them of their worry but they must also let us swing from the trapeze just so we know theyre always there to catch us as for any mischief you want to keep to yourself well what they dont know wont hurt

are you a doesband the latest irritating portmanteau refers to a husband who parents his own children a doesband has his own hectic job but still does his fair share at home without being asked writes harriet walker the times journalist who coined the term a doesband knows where the calpol is and when ballet kit is needed he gets up with the children and does bedtime he feeds them bathes them does the school run knows when their nails need to be cut and that behind their ears can get gunky i hate the term but walker makes a salient point that men who share childcare equally with their partners including the mental load are still rarer than they should be there are more and more female breadwinners but according to the office for national statistics women still do more unpaid work than men walker writes about staying awkwardly silent during conversations with other women about their useless partners it can feel like boasting to go into just how much your male partner does im only discussing heterosexual relationships here since having a baby ive been depressed by how little some men seem to get away with doing when it comes to their own children and how normalised that is take the loathsome phrase daddy daycare or the fact that my husband is frequently congratulated for taking his own son out for a walk something that has literally never happened to me i feel lucky to have a partner who took five months of shared parental and annual leave who feeds we combifed which set the tone from the start changes comforts plays cooks shops sorts the childcare payments nightweaned the baby and the worst task of all deals with the nappy bins yet i shouldnt feel lucky it should be normal on the bright side lots more men are what used to be called involved fathers while also trying to hold down fulltime work seeing how challenging that can be has made me reflect how in our capitalist system men cant have it all either for many being able to work from home during the pandemic has been a gamechanger i dont think women are inherently better caregivers than men says alex marsh a yearold market researcher with two daughters aged nine and he tells me that he has always strived to do his share remembering how the midwife wrote hands on dad on her notes as though that was remarkable when he and his wife said they shared the nappy changing alex was the night duty parent but was still working in london all week now that he only goes into the office twice a week he is able to read his kids bedtime stories every night cook most of their meals and handle their school admin and i love it he says alex says he doesnt feel that exceptional among his peers except maybe in terms of the cooking but he worries that they are a minority there are still a lot of relationships out there where the woman is expected to do more simply because she is a woman a friend who works in tech a similarly handson dad doesnt feel rare either he finds the term doesband infantilising hes messaging me back at am while trying to settle his toddler daughter and says the majority of fathers he knows are equal parents in his industry its considered commonplace he got four months of paid paternity leave i still notice a huge generational legacy in behaviour he says his grandparents and parents have been surprised by how dedicated he and his partner are to parenting equally thats not to say its easy theres no getting around that its draining and runs you into the ground he says in the early stages theres anger and frustration my friends talk of the early stages makes me think that perhaps some couples succeed at equal parenting right off the bat while others negotiate and learn as they go steph douglas who runs the thoughtful gift company dont buy her flowers and has three children says its been a journey that has involved me trying to understand why i was so resentful and unhappy after we had kids she found the fair play method a system that helps couples share household chores equally key in making their parenting genuinely more equal rather than simply giving her husband a list of tasks as well as now sharing much of the parenting her partner is in the school whatsapp group they succeeded in signing up all the dads after she noticed it was only mothers some of us might move in circles where equal parenting is the norm but the stats tell a different story there is cause for hope though while handson dads have always existed they are becoming more commonplace among younger generations of parents and policy especially in terms of paternity leave needs to catch up women seem less inclined to put up with an unfair division of labour and a heavy mental load which is sexist and in many cases no longer makes financial sense i enjoy the tv comedy motherland and have seen that sadly the useless absent husband in it reflects the reality in some households but millennial fathers i speak to repeatedly highlight how retrograde and depressing the wimpy stayathome dad character kevin is he simply does not resonate with younger parents and though there is still a long way to go that can only be a cause for hope as for the term doesband it can get in the bin with the nappies whats working as well as equal parenting i owe a lot to ysls touche eclat concealer for making me look less haggard after all the sleepless nights why dont you look like a shoe my friend said suspiciously when she met me for lunch shortly after i gave birth but now ive found a new favourite beauty pies superluminous undereye genius cream its

while millions of parents are battling for pay rises that keep up with the cost of living britains youngsters have received an increase in their average annual income outpacing inflation according to new data the figures on childrens pocket money and earnings part of what was claimed to be the most indepth study of the uks youth economy also found that sixyearolds had enjoyed the biggest pay rise in the form of a annual increase meanwhile average earnings from babysitting leapt in a year to top while some savvy children were able to prise cash out of their parents for jobs such as making someone a coffee or smiling for a family photo the data was based on the finances of more than children and was collected from user activity on the natwest rooster money pocket money app and prepaid debit card whether it was down to parents deciding to shield their childrens finances from the worst of the cost of living crisis or an improvement in youngsters ability to negotiate a better financial deal and monetise small tasks the study based on data collected between march and february this year suggested that british kids have fared a lot better financially than many adults the headline finding was that average earnings increased by to a year or a week outpacing cpi inflation which was for the same period however this was despite pocket money routines becoming far less consistent with only of children receiving a regular allowance down from in instead of committing to hand over a fixed regular sum parents have been leaning towards oneoff payments using special occasions and good behaviour as opportunities for extra generosity at the same time said the study authors entrepreneurial youngsters were increasingly turning to side hustles to ensure a steady stream of income revenues from reselling possessions such as clothes increased by and tutoring benefited from a huge premium with average earnings for each job soaring to while many would expect pocket money to rise with age it was to yearolds who enjoyed the highest weekly pay cheque at on average yearolds took home a slightly lower perhaps reflecting increasing financial independence the

it is a truism of parenting that it goes so fast but as anyone who has been forced to sit on a bench and watch their children run tireless circuits of the playground knows sometimes it goes so slowly you feel as if youre losing your mind i know people who will do anything to avoid playground duty will beg their friends to coordinate so they dont have to do it alone or will discreetly wear headphones throughout so that while maintaining eyes on their children they can listen to a podcast and be entirely mentally absent as the weather heats up and we crawl out of our screendependent winters new york playgrounds are alive with the shriek of joshua minutes i have fought with the joshuaminutes tendency for years the urge to cut short the visit to the playground the park the toy aisle at target came on strongest when my children were smaller and could still be a danger to themselves somehow the combination of mindless repetition on the slide on the swings and the need for hypervigilance in case someone fell off something induced a state of almost exquisite boredom that i occasionally think has an equivalence in for example bag checkers at the airport the job is monotonous in the extreme but the consequences of not doing it properly can be dire that particular dynamic has changed over the years as the requirements for my involvement have evolved these days long periods will pass in which nothing is required of me at all punctuated by the occasional request watch this that wasnt it that wasnt it either that i check in to witness someone doing a cartwheel if i wanted to i could disappear into backtoback episodes of my current podcast obsessions youre wrong about and this is actually happening and at the beginning of this spring i did the experience felt simultaneously like an amazing win and vaguely like cheating to be presentnot present when youre cleaning the house is one thing yet to mentally absent oneself from ones kids to be always projecting forwards in anticipation of this particular moment being over has started to feel like missing the point i should add that in general and when it doesnt involve swings i am very good at doing nothing i could sit looking at the wood grain on a table for a long time and be more or less content there is copious literature on the necessity of boredom for children mostly mentioned these days in the context of warnings about overscheduling and screens there is less about the usefulness of boredom for adults and what there is tends to be found in the literature of timemaximisation where boredom is often framed as an aid to creativity or achievement in and of themselves these idle periods have no apparent value but increasingly they strike me as the solid matter of life and the moments ill look back on with the deepest nostalgia ive been having this sense for a few years now but its pathetic that what has sharpened revelation is the experience twice in a row of accidentally going out without my phone after the panic subsided i sat in the sunshine while my children rode their bikes up and down and then ditched them to play in the sand i watched a barge make its way up the hudson i pointed out two sparrows enjoying a sand bath what even is that i could have been listening to the reallife story of a woman who survived a home invasion but instead i eavesdropped on some young people playing volleyball farther up the sand i felt very happy that i was neither young nor under any obligation to play volleyball when the reflex urge to shout guys minutes surfaced because realistically how long can i be expected to just sit here i did the wildest thing and resisted it dont bring your phone they both say now when we go out there are limits to this lassitude which the other day nearly caused us to miss the last ferry off governors island and i do occasionally worry that taken to an extreme i will one day relax into a formless blob of inactivity that i will never fully be able to pull out of the funny thing is that of the two experiences of boredom fighting it was the one that delivered the greatest sense of dead time of passively waiting for something to end

much of the thought behind this column is to balance the highs and lows of parenting celebrating its joys as much as i lament its tedium i have mined the latter for laughs as much as any parent but i hope ive put across that for all the easy jokes about how terrible parenting can be its also genuinely enjoyable not just in some theoretical love conquers all kind of way but in the real tangible nonsentimental sense of actual enjoyment being a dad has i hope ive made clear given me more wrinkles from smiling than frowning and basically i hope ive built up enough goodwill that i can afford to write the following being without my children for four days last weekend was truly truly wonderful mick and maria got married in galway in a beautiful ceremony attended by many of our favourite people in january we decided we would take this run solo and my inlaws agreed to mind the kids we hatched alternate plans as backup then our daughters sleep training finally took plans became bookings became a schedule and we set off for four days and three nights of childlessness four days is as long as weve ever been away from our son and a good deal longer than weve been apart from our daughter so it would be customary to say we were worried about leaving them i find that worried is not quite the right word but ecstatic might get a little closer as everyone who met us there will testify theres something unspeakably gauche about being childfree at a wedding for one thing you find yourself mentioning it to everyone in the manner of an elderly aunt and uncle whove returned from marbella with breathless stories of tapas and orangina we took a dip in the pool this morning youll say to deeply unimpressed childless friends together youll add all but wiping tears from your eyes we drank and danced and stayed up late collapsing into bed with the shocking nerveshredding pleasure of knowing we could sleep for as long as we want without child services becoming involved we ventured into galway city for lunch with pals walking its pretty streets starryeyed like ariel from the little mermaid our friends wisely kept their distance as we clapped buskers and pointed moronically at things in shops astounded by all the quotidian joys of our newfound independence delighted not to be carrying either small people a buggy or the kg ballast of baby accessories which has accompanied us outdoors for the past five years we held hands like young lovers and generally made tits of ourselves we returned refreshed and ebullient to find our kids had hardly noticed wed gone perhaps we chafed

my daughter being oneyearold mostly keeps her thoughts to herself i won the battle of the primordial syllables so for the past two months the only word shes said is dada a small consolation for the fact that like her older brother she vastly prefers her mothers company to my own her refusal to say mama appears to be an accident of speech and her obsessive repetitions of dada are about as meaningful as they would be if she said the name of our local amazon delivery man times a day but ill take the victories where they come i dont yet know which of these uses of dada are automatic responses and which might be placeholders for actual speech tiny little attempts to articulate those thoughts and feelings she cant yet verbalise still less whether she is simply referring to the early thcentury art movement begun by the zurich avant garde all could be true at different points of each day and much of my time with her is spent trying to decipher each utterance and sort it into its category youd be forgiven for thinking this doesnt make for especially scintillating conversation but youd be wrong it is inarguably the part of her development i find the most fascinating shes started standing for seconds of a time and i cheer each time she does ditto her increasing dexterity with objects at least on those occasions on which she is not smashing them over my head but none of those small milestones fill me with as much headscratching wonder as speech development theres a ted talk called the birth of a word by mit computer scientist deb roy i watched it long before i had kids long enough ago that people were still watching ted talks i guess in it he illustrates his sons fairly standard experience of language acquisition which resulted in him learning words by the age of two what is remarkable however is that roy deployed a suite of cameras and microphones inside his home for the entire period picking up every utterance his son made allowing him to showcase their gradual evolution this culminated in a second clip of his son at bath time in which we hear the babbleword gaga slowly mutating over months to waga then wada and finally into water its a stunning sequence of audio compacting the experience of every single human on the planet into a single wondrous slope of increasing awareness rendering the mundane act of speech miraculous moreover it suggests that even those smallest most garbled syllables our children offer could be conveying meaning much earlier than we realise so i watch my daughter speak with this in mind as dada morphs into the occasional baba and gugug makes its first few appearances at bath time she opts for dededeh rather dashing my hopes that she would emerge with a gaga fully formed not that i mind of course with the flowering of her language iits only a matter of time before she addresses my wife by name and i lose the one advantage i have left i resolve to say nothing in the hopes i can stall this whole thing

in i found myself living as a sole parent to an eightmonthold baby i had been on holiday in nimbin visiting mum when my partner ended the relationship from sydney via email this was a huge shock and obviously not something i was expecting i was forced to leave my career and friends behind and move to a town with the highest unemployment in the state i had a degree in social science with a double major in government and policy and had worked at state parliament so this was a huge change the caring responsibilities as a new mother were also a shock i was neckdeep in parenting custody issues and had taken on caring responsibilities for my elderly mother when i got a letter confirming my eligibility for parentsnext in at this time there was only one article on the entire internet about the program because my daughter was fouryearsold not five i was ineligible as per the legislation and went to my initial appointment fully prepared the woman treated me like a petulant child and said if you dont sign this privacy waiver allowing her to call my gp without my knowledge we will cut your payments if you dont take your child to swimming lessons we will cut your payments she asked me what i wanted as my goal i made her write get parentsnext abolished then i went home and started a war with the department of employment sign up for guardian australias free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup during my fiveyear campaign i heard horrific stories from other women a woman with a threedayold newborn still bleeding and still sore from the birth was made to sit in a parentsnext office where she was told her payments would be cut if she didnt attend storytime there were other stories the whistleblowers working for parentsnext being told that they had to force women to sign the privacy waiver knowing they were vulnerable the women whose providers chastised them threatened them and made them feel they were worthless the monetary value of unpaid care work in australia has been estimated to be billion the equivalent to of gdp unpaid work is not included in gdp calculations however parentsnext providers were certainly reimbursed for their time and also incentivised with bonuses million of public money was channeled to private interests with the parentsnext program thats a lot of money invested in devaluing parenting i made submissions to two of the three inquiries into parentsnext and at both inquiries there was strong support from the contractors to keep the program due to its benefits however the stress of trying to fulfil mutual obligations so you dont lose the only money you have to house and feed your children is not a benefit its extremely scary and the mental health effects of the program were obvious to me in the work i did advocating did the government realise the detrimental effects of this pressure did they care why were we slogging it out parenting if no one gave a shit it was the hardest job id ever done and yet was seemingly useless i was useless this was the place most women went i wont forgive the government for treating parents women unpaid workers like this today the news came through that the government will scrap the parentsnext program from july and from today mutual obligations and any penalties are suspendedcancelled already this morning my facebook group has been flooded with comments and messages from parents receiving texts and emails saying they are no longer compulsory participants parents are relieved they can focus on raising their children instead of worrying if their payments will be suspended because their child is sick in the hospital and cant get to their swimming lessons australia doesnt value parenting but parenting is work and cancelling this program is a step in the

every festival season i think about something the writer nell frizzell once said to me during an interview about being the child of hippies and being taken to womad the international arts festival she described it as standing in a field next to your dad wearing a bumbag and thinking oh ive seen enough men from kazakhstan playing fiddles it never fails to make me laugh because not only have i lived that experience though it was my mum who took me to womad but because it comically captures that feeling of your parents dragging you along to something that they insist youll love when really youre there because they want to be im still recovering from glastonbury my first trip away from my son and it turns out the perfect choice for that purpose because there was so much going on that i couldnt focus on worrying about the distance between us and it turns out that parenthood prepares you well for the chaos and squalor could i handle very little sleep and quite a lot of exposure to human faeces absolutely am i inured to unpredictable behaviour strange meals at odd hours and weird bursts of overwhelming emotion also yes i was never going to take my son to glastonbury because i wanted that time for myself but i didnt really have any thoughts about those who choose to take their children to large festivals until i saw firsthand what a miserable time some babies were having on arrival i was almost immediately confronted by the sight of a nearnaked newborn being carried through a campsite i try as much as possible not to judge other parents but when after midnight you see a baby in ear defenders being hauled in a cart through a crowd of adults all of whom are off their faces while the infant cowers under a blanket it doesnt really seem in their best interests a couple of times i saw parenting that shocked me its really not ok one young woman said to me near tears about one especially distressed baby still im not saying these people were categorically bad parents weve all misjudged situations been overly optimistic and ended up regretting it perhaps these parents spent all day at the kidzfield which has amazing entertainment and where the national childbirth trust is on hand to help with feeding bathing and changing and found they couldnt find their way back to their camper van i noticed the kids having the worst time didnt seem to be the hippie kids the hippie kids you see at womad and glastonbury largely seem to be having a blast the happiest baby i saw all weekend was in a tipi in the healing fields with her mum having a lovely peaceful time i also loved seeing the older kids who reminded me of the ones i grew up around you know the type beautifully and rambunctiously feral with ratty long hair bleached by the sun bare feet weatherbeaten faces you can tell they live offgrid in cornwall or wales spend all their time outdoors and scarcely know what the internet is if my experience is anything to go by lets just say theres a chance that theyre not all up to date with their immunisations and that really isnt ok and as i wrote in an article in about the hippie revival they definitely face significant embarrassment in school and social settings but in terms of the values that they are raised with they are caring and kind and progressive often the world that isnt comes as quite a shock festivals are important for kids i think because they show diverse groups of people coming together in a largely harmonious way to engage with music and culture they teach children about costume and play and allow them to explore the outdoors safely away from screens recognising that modern parents are especially keen to continue going to them festivals have become more childfriendly than ever with womad having a whole world of children and camp bestival being entirely conceived of as a familyfriendly festivalcumcamping holiday with a plethora of activities and even a cbeebies bedtime story tent and theyre important for parents too some people would have you believe that your life is over when you have children festivals prove that you can still do things albeit a bit differently though i didnt have my child with me and was very much partying as a verb i was still such a mum making sure unaccompanied children made it out of the toilets ok forming a human barrier to protect a crying teenage girl from a drunken oaf carrying around a mini firstaid kit and a little sandwich bag of sliced orange for my premixed negroni seeing the hippie kids of glastonbury also made me question my own parenting something that is healthy to do from time to time do i want my child to live a largely urban indoor life or am i interested in giving him something closer to my own childhood we know from the children of the counterculture that hippie parents dont always get it right while researching my first novel which is on this very topic i read some harrowing accounts and would particularly recommend the book wild child girlhoods in the counterculture edited by chelsea cain but nor am i convinced that modern urban environments are always the best either and so like thousands before me i have come away simultaneously shattered and enlivened feeling that i have much to think about perhaps ill want to change our lives or perhaps ill come back to earth go back to how things were and forget that other ways of living are possible until the next one of course whats working blood on the tracks bob dylans album is the babys latest lullaby record he is almost always asleep by the end of idiot wind which at minutes and seconds long almost sends me into a stupor too im pleased at how effective it is but i sometimes wish i could hear beyond the first four songs whats not the sprinklers at our local playground are broken again and during some of the warmest weather our landlords are refusing to give us an outdoor tap so we cant even fill a paddling pool perhaps this is why my childhood of paddling in rock pools and swimming in cool mountain rivers feels so tantalising at the moment rhiannon lucy cosslett is a guardian columnist,2023-06,every festival season think something writer nell frizzell said interview child hippy

the people who design travel cots belong in prison im generally in favour of restorative justice and rehabilitation but for this ill make an exception we are luckier than most in that the baby will sleep on the hard bit of plywood thats supposed to pass for a mattress but he does need a few pats on the bum to settle and unless you are stretch armstrong a contemporary reference there for you kids this is all but impossible likewise lowering the baby or in our case large toddler into the cot which if youre a woman of average height involves squatting over one of the corners and hoping you dont bash your crotch on it so that your swearing wakes them up something which definitely hasnt happened to me ever basically they are designed for babies who are heavy sleepers and tall men if i sound grumpy its because weve just been on our first seaside holiday as parents so travel cots are fresh in my mind though i opened with a negative that first time your child sees the sea if he or she is lucky enough to get there is something very special i knew he would love it but i wasnt prepared for how much i have written before about how parenthood allows you to experience childhood again and as it turns out this very british seaside holiday conjured for me many happy memories of crabbing and paper sandcastle flags and fingers playing with the surface of rock pools the soft spongy feel of green seaweed beneath your toes the roughness and smell of its black counterpart it was like travelling in time and has given me some of the happiest moments that i have ever known holidays change when you are a parent the packing and unpacking of bags feels almost constant the volume of stuff that you have to bring is astonishing the timing and smoothness of the journey becomes a lot more important so when for example the airconditioning is broken as it was on both train journeys thanks south western it doesnt just feel uncomfortable but actually dangerous as for flying we havent done that yet but our nct whatsapp group has seen people sharing the minutiae of their journeys what to do about bottles which toys to pack to entertain their child what to do if they have a massive nappy explosion im grateful for this information from the parents braver than i until quite recently i couldnt face the prospect mine is a welltravelled generation five times more than our grandparents according to one survey and not having been abroad much growing up i was lucky enough to be able to do so in my s but our preterm baby took a while to adjust to life outside the womb and weve had a hard time with illness so we cocooned ourselves for longer than many there were times during my maternity leave that it felt almost as if we were wasting it by staying at home a good friend went to countries during her maternity leave including argentina and japan she works hard and this was their opportunity to travel as a family of course at times i felt jealous especially over winter as i pounded the pavements around my house for the thousandth time in the driving rain but i also thought all power to her for being so intrepid though she feels guilty im waiting for him to be an eco warrior when he grows up and hate us you have to hate your parents for something we are not the first generation to have travelled a friend of mine was taken to tibet as a baby but i think we are the first generation to take it for granted not only that but we risk our children turning to us and asking us given the climate emergency how we felt that we could justify ourselves so in a way not fancying a trip to crete in august with a newborn something a friend described as hell has been good for our carbon footprint its a shame uk holidays are so expensive some london nurseries do day trips to the seaside but every child deserves a holiday as well as being a matter of privilege and finances i suspect travelling as a parent is down to temperament i have learned that i am not one of those laidback gungho mothers i will probably never take my child backpacking even the more remote greek islands that i love are off limits for now yet the seaside trip has made a holiday abroad feel possible i want a short flight a nearby airport a decent hospital and reasonable temperatures but im starting to feel more optimistic that i am coming to understand is one of the lessons of parenthood things can seem hard impossible even and in the moment that feeling gives the impression of being permanent it never is when people say it gets easier this is what they mean sometimes you try things and they dont work out and these setbacks can shake your confidence but often like our little seaside trip they do and you can feel the world being returned to you wider and more brimming with potential than before holidays may not be the same but the joy of seeing the sea through your childs eyes makes up for the fact that you may have opted for a trip to robin hoods bay as opposed to hiking in peru perhaps the time will come that i feel brave enough theyll have to design a better travel cot first though whats working i thought this novara media article about the history of national dried milk which fed of british babies in and the astronomical price of formula was just the kind of radical thinking and research we need when it comes to infant feeding whats not we are seeing our first glimpses of toddler tantrums especially when it comes to the high chair the baby adopts a stiff starfish position whenever we come near it but im not about to let him eat his dinner while he does yoga poses in the living room hes throwing some great shapes these days any advice appreciated rhiannon lucy cosslett is a guardian columnist and author,2023-06,people design travel cot

jalna hanmer who has died aged of heart failure was a leading feminist campaigner and scholar in she founded the ma programme in womens studies at the university of bradford an influential course that helped establish feminist studies as an academic field within sociology both in the uk and internationally hanmer saw academic research and publishing as a way of influencing the policy and practice of state agencies in tackling domestic violence and sexual assault and was a founder of the national charity womens aid she is best known for her work influencing police to improve their response to domestic abuse hanmers research on this topic published as women violence and crime prevention included numerous interviews with victims and criminal justice agencies alongside this she founded an activist group that helped raise public awareness her efforts resulted in changes to policing policy in yorkshire and nationally including a specialist unit of trained officers the start of domestic violence units and the directive that guidelines be issued to all officers attending domestic violence callouts additionally police officers were mandated to classify domestic violence as a crime rather than a family dispute or a civil matter and to offer information on support available such as womens aid refuges to the victim i began working with hanmer at bradford in early helping organise what remains the largest ever feminist gathering in europe focused on tackling male violence towards women and girls the weeklong conference violence abuse and womens citizenship was held in brighton that november hosting speakers from across the globe including andrea dworkin on pornography and teboho maitse an adviser to nelson mandelas government delegates came from more than countries and numerous international and regional networks were set up during that week many of which still exist one ukbased conference speaker was irene ivison whose daughter fiona was abused into prostitution as a child and subsequently murdered alongside ivison hanmer founded the leedsbased coalition for the removal of pimping crop now known as parents against child exploitationpace an organisation that was key in exposing the prevalence of grooming gangs in the north of england inspired by norma hotalings keynote speech in brighton on setting up in the us the first perpetrator programme for kerb crawlers hanmer and i devised a similar scheme in west yorkshire launched in during the oneday course for firsttime offenders speakers including police officers health workers and women who had escaped street prostitution themselves would address the men with an aim to dispel the myths about prostitution being harmless and to expose them to the consequences for the women and wider society of their actions born in walla walla washington state hanmer spent her childhood on the west coast of the us her father nevin alderman was a newspaper printer while her mother marie donley owned a restaurant when they divorced in hanmer moved to california eventually attending berkeley and graduating with a ba in sociology in in the late s she moved to europe spending a year in la rochelle france where she met and married charles hanmer an english artist they moved to the uk and were then divorced during the s hanmer worked for a tenants housing association and as a community organiser before beginning her academic career as a lecturer in sociology at the london school of economics during this period she lived with the playwright leonard webb with whom she had two children stephen who died in an accident in and laurence she was involved in the antivietnam war movement chairing what became known as the vietnam solidarity campaign but she found her true calling in the burgeoning womens liberation movement of the s she played a leading role in the annual national conference and in helped found the national womens aid federation later known as womens aid which grew into a national network of refuges for women escaping domestic abuse from her early days of activism and academic study hanmers work centred on the victims and survivors of male violence describing these women as the experts in she took a number of women from womens aid refuges to the international tribunal on crimes against women in brussels attended by women from nations where they spoke about the realities of living with domestic violence in hanmer moved from london school of economics to the university of bradford she introduced a unique requirement for acceptance on the womens studies course every student had to volunteer at a feminist project such as womens aid or rape crisis throughout the year she firmly believed that feminism could not be learned through academic theory alone her publications include well founded fear written with her longtime partner sheila saunders a founder of jewish womens aid with whom hanmer lived from until her death in in the early s hanmer set up

domestic abuse survivors are being forced to return to live with perpetrators or face homelessness because they are unable to get a place in a refuge amid evergrowing demand a report seen by the observer to be published on monday found that more than a quarter of the women supported last year through a governmentfunded scheme were subjected to further abuse by the perpetrator while waiting for a refuge space of the women who completed support from the womens aid programme in spent time sleeping on other peoples sofas had no money for essentials and nine slept rough the no woman turned away research found that of the women had disabilities had no recourse to public funds and were from black and minority backgrounds despite being required by the domestic abuse act to provide refuge services and safe accommodation to domestic abuse victims local authorities in england often did not have the resources or the knowledge to fulfil their statutory duty failing victims the report found these findings suggest that despite these encouraging developments many statutory agencies far too often fail to uphold their duty to support survivors it said the observer reported in april that safe housing was denied to more than women in england escaping domestic abuse last year lisa johnson manager of direct services at womens aid condemned the latest findings the worst since the project began in blaming system failures theres a real lack of refuge vacancies in the country local services are under a lot of pressure to financially support women particularly with no recourse to public funds and theyre not in a position to do that she said other contributing factors include inadequate funding the cost of living crisis poor access to support for women with insecure immigration status systemic racism and insufficient knowledge among professionals working across public services when women reach out for example to the police local authority housing team social care there are real system failures within all of that johnson said most survivors when they reach out for support thats a huge courageous step for anybody to take because we know working in the sector that leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time if women fail to get support johnson added their choice is to go back to the perpetrator or become homeless as well as being potentially dangerous this can have a disastrous impact on a womans chances of finding refuge her hopes of safety are pretty much lost or diminished for the future johnson said we know perpetrators as soon as they feel theyre losing control of that relationship losing control of that woman losing control of the children violence will escalate and could be lifethreatening calling for mandatory training across all services including the judicial system she said demand for the services is evergrowing womens aid urged the government to commit to a minimum funding settlement of m a year for specialist domestic abuse services in england of which a minimum of m it said should be ringfenced for refuge services they also said women should be protected whatever their immigration status the local government association said more funding was needed to meet huge demand nesil caliskan chair of the lgas safer and stronger communities board said domestic abuse is a horrendous crime which councils take extremely seriously however they cannot tackle this alone the cooperation of other public services including the police is essential if we are to work to eliminate domestic abuse while the new funding announced to provide accommodationbased support under the domestic abuse act was positive the current provision is under huge demand further funding would help to alleviate these issues calling for an equal focus on funding for prevention and early intervention caliskan added this should be alongside wider communitybased support as well as accommodationbased support and refuges a government spokesperson said it is absolutely critical that victims get the support they need and councils have a duty to provide safe accommodation to victims under the domestic abuse act that is why since april we have provided over m to councils across england to ensure that victims can find safe refuge alongside a range of services including counselling and therapy children support and advocacy support to access healthcare and benefits we have also committed a further m in funding to deliver these duties from april they are most at risk when trying to leave at any given time habiba molvipathan is working on to domestic abuse cases helping survivors get into a position of safety but a considerable amount of her time working as a practitioner for no woman turned away is also spent explaining domestic abuse to the services that are supposed to be helping survivors were always having a conversation with statutory services just to explain the dynamics of abuse why a woman doesnt leave straight away why doesnt she report to the police why she cant go back to the danger area why she cant just get into refuge said molvipathan who has been working in the violence against women and girls sector for a decade she wishes there was funding for them to provide regular training to statutory services so they would better understand domestic abuse its important just like you would with first aid every couple of years to refresh in the last year she has seen client referrals go up particularly around holidays and football matches many have no recourse to public funds which means theres less support available to them they have fewer options and it takes a lot longer to find them suitable accommodation because there are so many other issues that need to be unpicked while they are waiting she helps her clients devise a safety plan which is regularly reviewed until they find safe suitable accommodation whilst youre trying to leave thats when the survivor is at most risk thats when the likelihood of abuse escalating is worse so thats a really important part of our work and risk assessment the most important way to respond to a woman making a disclosure is to listen and believe she said its responding with empathy and understanding thats so important,2023-06,domestic abuse survivor forced return live perpetrator face homelessness unable get place refuge amid evergrowing demand report

my wife calls me from ireland the baby has been acting up barely eating and refusing to sleep since she doesnt have a temperature were content she doesnt have a fever and wonder aloud if theres a sleep regression weve missed this is likely as we realise neither of us have used the term sleep regression since our son was her age when such phrases held biblical significance to us both back then we knew the timelines of sleep regressions and growth leaps as if they were our own medical histories in the years since a combination of gained experience increased confidence and an undeniable amount of sheer exhaustion means this has not been the case with our daughter whos been raised basically on vibes i try to console and counsel but find i can be of little help im in london and shes still in dublin as we have no childcare this week and her parents with a grace and kindness we can never repay are minding the baby during the day while she works from their spare room i meanwhile have travelled back home to walthamstow with our son for a week of solo parenting just in time for fathers day i expected it to be a strong test of my parenting mettle but my wifes experience has put mine in the shade and i squirm a bit as i tell her weve been having a wonderful time we have though aware that he might miss his mum and sister ive branded this week as a madcap holiday with his funloving dad calling it boyzweek i had in mind the kind of no rulez situation you got in s kids movies where the leash is off and anything goes milkshake and whipped cream sandwiches for breakfast skateboarding inside the house that kind of thing its a testament to the power of advertising that he bought this despite the fact my wife and i parent identically but ive had to get creative in turning boyzweek into the nonstop thrill ride its been billed as in the end i settled on letting him go to the playground for twice as long after school each day and enacting a special exciting configuration of snakes amp ladders where he can go up snakes if he wants i cannot i drew the line at letting him sleep in his school uniform to reduce dressing time in the morning a bizarre request rendered more bizarre still by my immediate memory of having wanted to do the same at his age but i have allowed him to tumble into bed beside me as soon as he wakes up so he can use my phone to find videos of giant squids and quiz me on facts about orcas my wife finds this all perfectly charming when i tell her about it but is interrupted by the baby crying it is only my son who is capable of stopping the tears taking my phone and pulling faces until his baby sister is reduced to fits of laughter can we do girlzweek soon he asks his mum as i unfurl the snakes amp ladders board with one

james a marketing manager from hove remembers the weeks after his son jude was born in spring last year mostly as a blur i had two weeks off which is not enough time to adjust to parenthood he says i found the experience uniquely confronting seeing and holding my son for the first time was overwhelming i felt instant love for him but was illprepared for the crash when the initial joy wore off i felt a crushing pressure to be attentive and conscientious at one point after a visit from a health visitor i found myself sobbing the raw emotion sleeplessness snatched conversations and scoffed meals of those early days have convinced him james says that the uks paternity leave offer needs to improve it should be far more generous six weeks paid leave should be the minimum my employer was supportive and flexible but i found the adjustment to fatherhood brutal and all the while in the back of my mind was the knowledge that i had to go back to work after two weeks which felt cruel the uk has the least generous paternity leave rights in europe the statutory paternity leave entitlement for new fathers is up to two weeks almost a third of fathers say they took no paternity leave at all after their last child was born according to a recent poll matthew is one of those fathers the it specialist in the west midlands says he dearly wanted to take paternity leave when his children were born i thought then and still think now that its a vital time to bond as well as to share the load he says finances barred him from doing so however as his employer offered only the statutory legal minimum pay to take it would mean not having enough money to cover that months mortgage and bills he says putting my new family even deeper into debt wasnt exactly a palatable option so i missed out on that opportunity for the sake of keeping our heads above water i feel bitter that some dads are criticised for not taking paternity leave without it being considered that doing so can be financially devastating fathers who benefited from longer leave were effusive about how beneficial it was for them and their families jacob a local government officer from bromley was able to take four weeks off work after the birth of his and his wifes twin boys in march and considers himself very fortunate my wife had an emergency csection we were in hospital for close to a week after the birth and she could barely walk in that time he says i had saved up as much annual leave as i could during the year to take two extra weeks off after the boys were born and im really glad i did so i could support her jacobs employer paid him his full salary for the first week of his leave before statutory paternity pay of about kicked in for the second week taking a full month off rather than two weeks really allowed us to bond as a family and gave my wife extra time to recover jacob says the twins are the most delicious little things and i wouldnt have traded that first month with them for anything we could get to know each other work out a routine find our new normal taking more time off with the help of shared parental leave was out of the question jacob says i earn quite a bit more than my wife so it didnt make financial sense for us to split her leave if the finances had been different i would definitely have taken shared parental leave three months off to be with my boys would have been fantastic time ill now never get back he feels attitudes towards parental leave are changing in his social environment im not sure my father ever changed a nappy and i dont think thats terribly unusual for men of that generation but the men around me of a similar age who are having children all want to be very engaged and active in raising them i would love to see the implementation of fairer and more generous parental leave in the uk scott inglis a university lecturer from carlisle was able to take shared parental leave after his daughter esme was born so far its been magical i love it inglis says the twoweek paternity portion while woefully inadequate was easy to organise the shared parental leave however was hopelessly byzantine and overly complex it took us a couple of months to sort that out with hr shared parental leave rules meant the couple ended up having to work alternate weeks instead of splitting the working week between them during the leave period this is of no benefit to our employer made no sense to anyone involved inglis says he and his partner will both have to return to fulltime work in september esme will have to go to nursery when shes five months old which is not a great thought but five months leave was the maximum we could afford the culture here in the uk seems to be mum takes the leave dad gets back to work as soon as possible six months paid leave would boost breastfeeding productivity it would make all the difference,2023-06,james marketing manager hove remembers week son jude wa born spring last year mostly blur two week

almost a third of fathers took no paternity leave after the birth of their child as a result of the uks measly paternity leave rights according to research two decades after paternity leave rights

according to a yougov survey commissioned for a report by the campaign group pregnant then screwed the centre for progressive policy thinktank cpp and women in data of the fathers surveyed said they would take more leave if the rate of statutory paternity pay spp increased the report released by the organisations before fathers day this weekend argues that boosting rights for fathers and second

local authorities could boost gdp by increasing economic output by bn these things really do make a difference to gender equality said rosie fogden the head of research and analysis at cpp the report titled leave in the lurch paternity leave gender equality and the uk economy argues that the low rate of pay available to fathers after the birth of a child a week or of the national living wage

a new mental health issue in the two years after the birth of their most recent child and of those parents had received no treatment joeli brearley the founder of pregnant then screwed said it was the first data of its kind to show the economic benefit of paternity leave and she called on political parties to include progressive parenting policies in their manifestos before the next general election we have the least generous paternity benefit in europe she said dads and partners get a measly a week for two weeks and because babies cant suddenly look after themselves when they are two weeks old this means the joy and sometimes the burden of care falls on to the shoulders of women analysis of pts state of the nation survey data weighted by women in data to provide a nationally representative picture shows that women who had a child or adopted in the past three years had taken an average of weeks leave compared with an average of two weeks for fathers of those surveyed of

had access to and had taken their full entitlement of leave compared with of men with a household income of more than recent research by the trades union congress tuc found that one in five fathers were not taking any paternity leave mainly for financial reasons with half of families struggling when fathers did go on paternity leave the report estimates that increasing paternity leave to six weeks offering it at of salary and opening up the eligibility criteria to all working fathers and partners would cost between bn and bn a year for all those benefits that is a bargain said brearley

has labour rowed back on its promise of universal free childcare coming so soon after rachel reeves tempered the green new deal pledge telling the today programme that everything we do must rest on these pillars of economic and fiscal responsibility it sounds like the kind of thing it would do labour says it never promised universal free childcare in the first place and i went back to the primary text a bridget phillipson interview from april its true she talks about reimagining early years care as part of the education system which makes it sound universal and free but she also references estonia as a model where parents are guaranteed nursery places but pay according to their means the quality of the care is high wages and qualifications are higher and the sector is seen as a critical element of child development this is in contrast to the liz truss and jeremy hunt model where nursery is a place to park your child while you earn money so the drive in the sector is to keep wages low and childstaff ratios high ive actually seen the estonia model although it was in berlin and years ago a hangover from reunification east german universal provision overlaid with west german meanstested access all the nurseries were good enough that people didnt opt out and none of it was expensive even for affluent people i was struck not just by how happy everyone seemed with it already back then in contrast to the swingeing costs we faced in the uk but also the socially cohesive effect of parents from all classes putting their most treasured thing in the same place im not against that model but when you add together higher wages for nursery staff guaranteed places affordable prices better provision for parents doing long or irregular hours and a higher quality of care it doesnt sound cheap so if everything rests on the pillars of fiscal responsibility it doesnt sound true critically labours plan sounds both less generous and less likely to happen than the conservatives notion which is to guarantee free hours per week from the age of nine months is the gamble that everyone under is so sick of tory government that theyll vote labour whatever the promise the polls seem to bear this out but when parents are spending more on nurseries than mortgages the sheer pressure of that might be decisive when the time comes my happy place is to default back to the question when will labour realise that you cannot inspire voters by ceaselessly counselling caution but you cannot consider that seriously without making a proper reckoning of how much the conservatives have polluted the ecosystem of campaigning the tory idea of more free hours from a younger age wont happen the hour model is hanging by a thread anyway where the fees of the kids under three crosssubsidise the free hours of the kids over three if everyone over nine months has free hours nurseries will go bust and people wont be able to find places whatever theyre entitled to better cheaper childcare wont happen just like the new hospitals that wont happen like the levelling up that isnt happening like the taking back control didnt happen like the maweek for the nhs didnt happen like the restabilisation of the public finances that emphatically didnt happen we parse these differences between conservative prime ministers rishi sunak is a jam tomorrow person they say unlike chaotic liz truss and blowhard boris johnson who were jam all over everything now people but the underlying reality of the project they share is that the jam is fake and tomorrow never arrives this intense relaxation around breaking promises enables sunak to simply lift anything that sounds popular phillipson suggests breakfast clubs its in hunts spring budget parking his tanks on her lawn the commentators say using the lexicon of the olden days when people only said things they intended to do now when a tory pinches your idea it isnt cunning political plagiarism it merely invites the idea into the graveyard of things that by dint of having been promised will never happen how does an opposition party meet that challenge with secrecy by floating decoy ideas how do you insist on this fundamental difference between your parties that you are sincere and they are not its a genuine conundrum with no obvious fix all thats certain is not like this not by making continuous downward adjustments to the ambition of your project as the fiscal envelope tightens which brings us to the crunchy bit of the tory toxification that fiscal envelope yesterday yields on twoyear government debt rose by basis points debt repayments are growing faster than any other element of government spending labour seeking to regain a reputation for fiscal responsibility that it failed through its own negligence to protect during the cameron years has started to vocally prioritise prudence this lends it an aspect of complete impotence peddling a message whoever you vote for in the end the markets are in charge dont listen to your heart listen to your mortgage psychologically labour has elided the markets with the rightwing media and assumes theyll be out to get any labour government and must be preappeased i dont think thats true the high gilt yields are merely a logical response to the conclusion weve all reached if youre going to lend money to chancers grifters and nihilists you want to

labour has ruled out offering universal free childcare for children over nine months old but is considering a meanstested offer sources have told the guardian as the party strives to prove its fiscal credibility bridget phillipson the shadow education secretary told the sunday times earlier this year that labour would guarantee childcare from the end of parental leave until the end of primary school saying her reforms would resemble the birth of the nhs but shadow ministers are exploring options that backbenchers warn will fall short of that ambition instead of offering free or very cheap childcare to every family with a child over nine months old labour is looking at giving more support for poorer families while tapering it off for those on higher incomes labour officials are working on their plans even as the partys leadership tries to reduce spending commitments in an attempt to ward off attacks about the partys tax and spend policies a labour spokesperson said an expansion of childcare to all children is not labours policy last year labour announced that as part of its plans to modernise childcare that we will deliver free breakfast clubs for all primary school pupils in england paid for by closing the nondom tax loophole and allowing councils to offer more childcare provision where they are able to do so everything in our manifesto will be fully costed fully funded and subject to our fiscal rules the uk has one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world with some parents spending as much as of their takehome pay on care for young children but while the conservative government plans to expand the current offer of hours worth of free childcare a week so that parents can claim it before their children turn three labour has vowed to replace the system entirely saying it does not pay enough to providers to offer the necessary places labour officials are now fleshing out the details of that policy with sources saying they are looking at a range of options to extend support to as many families as possible without breaking the partys pledge to ensure government debt is falling by the end of the parliament party sources say they are keen to eliminate the gap that exists between the end of parental leave and when a child turns three and qualifies for the freehours programme one of the most effective ways to do this would be to increase meanstesting they say at the moment most working families where both parents have an expected annual income of below qualify for the full hours of free childcare in england labour officials are looking at whether that could be adjusted so that some families below that threshold do not get the full allocation as a way to pay for more support to families with younger children another option would be to give schools money to offer subsidised but not free childcare places estonia for example offers guaranteed kindergarten places from the age of months at heavily subsidised rates with fees in some settings equivalent to about a month while labour officials say they never promised universal childcare from nine months onwards some backbenchers are concerned the eventual proposals will not live up to phillipsons rhetoric one labour mp said they were concerned the childcare policy had become an easy target for the party as it tried to demonstrate its fiscal responsibility last week rachel reeves the shadow chancellor wrote to shadow ministers warning them not to make any unfunded policy announcements and on friday she announced the party would not meet its flagship promise to spend bn on green energy schemes until several years into the next parliament drastically cutting the scope and cost of the plans reeves has also told shadow ministers that the green prosperity fund would be the only pot of money available for new capital projects sparking a flurry of lobbying as senior figures in the party push to earmark money for a range of projects from schools to

university exams are over so our sons will be home soon that means we have spent a full academic year as emptynesters and im apprehensive about what they will find on their return and not just the brown crispy corpses of the elders houseplants we havent fallen apart split up or sunk into desperate sadness we missed them but they seemed happy enough so we were happy for them however their absence has made us what odd i think thats it odd for a start they havent been back since we installed two chairs in front of the glass door to the garden where we now spend all our free time like statler and waldorf from the muppets commenting usually unfavourably on the local birds im uncomfortable at the thought of our sons overhearing this stuff here comes doublechin magpie starlings are

monitoring and complaining about household electricity consumption in his eyeline he even calls it my pigeon domestically things have deteriorated dramatically we do one load of washing a week if that the not dirty enough to wash floordrobe situation is intense and i have largely kept my promise never to cook again unlike the groaning bird food shed the human cupboards are as bare and austere as my fathers were when i would visit him in my university days the only treat he could offer was a twopack of shortbread fingers pilfered from some great western train im not sure how to reconcile this with the two hours of vintage masterchef australia we watch every night but i can now judge the cuisson on a mud crab at paces and know how to use lemon myrtle or add macadamia crumb for a crunchy

back home in ireland this week my daughter plays with her cousins charlie and lucy who are eight days older and eight weeks younger respectively lucy and my daughter convey their love by pulling at the candyfloss strands of each others wispy hair charlie by contrast offers kisses to both but he appears to have learned how to kiss from a manual on giving the perfect headbutt thankfully each glancing bump from his noggin delights his smaller cousins immeasurably so tears are avoided were not so lucky when it comes to the other order of the day charlie has recently taken his first steps and an arms race legs race has arisen it would be wrong to be jealous of another baby for having walked before our own so we avoid saying this and instead focus on making sure were second and not third my baby is still very much finding her feet if you think about that phrase for any longer than a few seconds it doesnt make much sense in common parlance but fits her situation perfectly she spends much of her days doing it quite literally reaching for her feet as if shes just discovered they exist sometimes to engage in her favourite pastime of pulling off her socks or just to hold them in silent reverent wonder she pulls them inward to get a closer look bending them towards her face with the elasticity of a contortionist as for getting on her feet well at months old she can just about stand and is extremely pleased with herself when she does so its just that moving said feet is a harder task weve come close to a first step a few times which is to say we havent walking is one of those things you cant really almost do taking a single step is arguably not even walking so i must concede that taking zero steps is something less again we resume training shes gripping my index finger tightly extremely tightly she is still so small that her wrist is a single infinite dimple intersecting the lovely chub of her arm and the hand that emerges from the other end looks like it has been screwed on perhaps drawn from a big basket of replaceable hands sold separately for different needs this one is clearly the kung fu grip attachment though absurdly small and as soft and pink as an uncooked cube of chicken breast it never relinquishes its vicelike grip and turns my finger white as i raise her up to a standing position her legs wobble slightly before her knees click straight like a tape measure snapping into place still holding tight she takes one step then two but as i try to let go she bumps to the ground for the th time today as tears erupt our attempts at comfort fall on deaf ears luckily charlie is on hand to push past us and take control offering the one salve that stops her crying for good a big loving headbutt that soon has her smiling again did ye hear mammy

in september i thought i was the most intelligent person ever to exist by some masterstroke of family planning id managed to have two children spaced almost two years apart but because the first was born in september and the second august they were in adjacent school years by my calculations id saved two whole years of childcare which back then was more expensive than the mortgage but only because at that point liz truss was still in charge of childcare costs and had yet to screw with everyones mortgage and it wasnt even intentional my miracle i was a genius at the level of the ovary obviously i hadnt really thought through what the consequences would be once they hit the meaningfulexam stage of life which they still havent at the moment im just observing other people gcse and alevel events are objectively weird for a household whatever its composition because for the first time the kids day has the highest stakes you can pretend this is true for the preceding decade big day darling youre the narrator in sinbad the sailor and yes it is a big deal whether you get the crabs and the dancing squid in the right order but now it is real it doesnt matter what your job is whole human lives could be hanging off your performance you still wont come anywhere near the singular tightrope of the exam that absolutely atomised space where youre not allowed to ask for help you cant take a little more time and youll be judged on the outcome indeed that is all youll be judged on until such time as you achieve anything else which could be never the standard in the nuclear family industrial complex is to space your kids two years apart which means the day will arrive when that problem is squared gcses and alevels are happening at the same time per ancient sibling tradition one of them will be working neurotically hard and the other will be doing nothing at all it is impossible to tell whats really going on is the slacker doing secret work you have to hope so because the alternative is that theyve sacrificed their life chances just to make some obscure but universal point i and my sibling are not the same person witness in the matter of learning french vocabulary we are in fact opposites all the regular priorities and hierarchies are completely destroyed whose turn it is to feed the cat to use the bathroom to be a dick in normal times youd adjudicate on the basis of who was under the most pressure but now theyre both under intolerable pressure all the time ideally youd have foreseen this and had a third child who could act as an emotional donor sibling but you most likely didnt they fight constantly nobody knows why but we can all remember that hot indignation my sister and i had a massive row on the way to gcse physics me and alevel maths her she hit me in the face with a plastic bag it didnt really hurt is hit even the right word with plastic bags but i stormed off to get a different bus which didnt arrive so she was on time and i was late but for the first minutes of her timed conditions teachers kept going up to her and asking where i was the reason im still telling this story years later is that i did arrive eventually and i got an a and she got a b which is why you should never flap someone in the face with a plastic bag naturally then surveying this carnage in more or less every family i know my

the privatisation of childrens residential care in england over the past decade has resulted in worse outcomes this has long been suspected by critics of the current system which is dominated by providers either partly or wholly owned by private equity investors researchers at oxford university have now supplied proof the study found that outofarea placements which involve moving children away from their home networks could be attributed to outsourcing between and while there is wide variation between local authorities the ones that rely most on private placements are those with the worst outcomes the frequency of disruption was also measured like outofarea moves discontinuity is associated with worse experiences and reduced likelihoods of children developing the capacities and relationships that they need in order to thrive a vivid demonstration of this was provided in recent weeks by whistleblowers from the chain outcomes first following its decision to close homes at short notice a worker in one of those homes described the acute and selfdestructive distress of one young resident when told of her transfer as one of the saddest things ive ever seen the childrens homes association which represents owners took the unusual step last month of publicly berating outcomes first which is not among its members these hasty closures it said fell woefully short of the standards expected already attempts to repair this broken market have been promised an investigation by the competition and markets authority cma pointed to providers high profit margins and the risk of bankruptcies due to debt as evidence of dysfunction but it stopped short of recommending an end to forprofit placements or price caps last year the government rejected the recommendation of its independent reviewer josh macalister that a windfall tax should be levied instead of the bn overhaul proposed ministers said they would invest m in a series of pilot projects including regional commissioning hubs to strengthen councils position relative to suppliers from a roughly mix of public and private placements in england in we have moved following a decade of austerity in which council budgets were hit particularly hard to a situation where around are private we already knew that businesses were making excess profits with the cmas analysis showing an average profit margin of among large providers between and now we know that these businesses are looking after children less well than their public sector counterparts too the scottish and welsh governments have already committed to move away from a profit model with a separate review in northern ireland due to conclude soon the case for more radical change in england is overwhelming it is time to admit that the national market in childrens social care has failed and that this should have been foreseen because markets respond to prices residential care was bound to gravitate to where property is cheapest thus blackpool with a population of just now has childrens homes while london has to task cashstrapped councils with placing children close to home networks as ministers did while promoting a structure in which property and wage costs were bound to influence supply was a mistake throwing children out of their homes with a months notice as private equityowned outcomes first did is cruel what is needed is a longterm plan to develop alternatives which could include notforprofit as well as councilrun homes regulation must be tightened and disruption reduced some current practice makes a mockery of the states obligations and raises the question of whether children in care are actually being looked after or harmed,2023-06,privatisation childrens residential care england past decade ha resulted worse

one of the most memorable birthday parties ive hosted was also one of the easiest and cheapest our eldest son was turning five and wanted to invite his whole class i wasnt willing to host a party with more than fiveyearolds but i was willing to invite them for a play in our back garden after school i made a call no games no prizes no party bags no banquet just an invitation to swing by on their way home from school hang out and have some cake i added a firm no presents please so it was easy for the guests as well the result was short and it was sweet the kids amused themselves the parents watched while chatting the birthday boy had a ball then be still my beating heart they all went home no one expected more so no one was disappointed the bar was low stress levels were as well it wasnt the best party ever and it wasnt meant to be it was good and good was plenty good enough of course it could have been simpler still a handful of friends or even one some dont do a party every year how radical and how reasonable we might think of this as breaking vital rules but such rules are mostly selfimposed we have a choice its one thing to throw a party because you want to because it will bring joy to your child your family and your guests its quite another if youre driven by rules and expectations you secretly resent if youre paying for things you really cant afford if the process makes you snappy and stressed out perhaps if we spent more time doing things the way that works for us our families and our budget and less time trying to do things the way we think were supposed to wed be more relaxed and more sociable sometimes a bar were aiming for makes sense but sometimes its a result of precedents we perpetuate unthinkingly or assumptions about others expectations that weve never sought to question or to test whatever the case it seems to me we can be a little too diligent when it comes to meeting expectations and not diligent enough when it comes to questioning them will fellow parents really judge us harshly if we do things differently will our children really care if their party doesnt have all the trimmings if they do it might disappoint them and it might build character it might be an opportunity to direct their gaze from what they want to what they have if parties are allornothing affairs we might end up throwing them in the toohard basket if theyre casual and fun we might not dread them we might even enjoy them which will make guests more likely to as well i once received an invitation for a party at a park that asked kids to bring their own drink bottles it was a great idea it saved the hosts from buying drinks and made sense from an environmental perspective i can imagine some parents would worry this would be too much to ask of a guest but why shouldnt we seek ways to simplify and share the load sometimes parents tell their kids to use their words if were really worried that bucking a tradition will cause awkwardness or confusion if we want to do something differently but also want people to know what to expect we can use our words we might be worried the word party means were obliged to provide lunch a cake games and lolly bags these may well be expected but expectations can be changed hey friends johnnys turning five weve decided to go for simple this year no party just a play at the park after lunch no presents please xx it feels ridiculous to say something so obvious but also strangely necessary communicating can change expectations our words can engender understanding dispel awkwardness and confusion change onerous traditions and make life easier we gently teach our kids that they dont have to do things just because their friends do that they dont have to be like everybody else that if theyre struggling they need only ask for help we encourage them to use their words and then we do the opposite ourselves by choosing not to meet this or that expectation i can make my life easier i can be a more relaxed parent and i can lower the bar for others some parents might judge me but im willing to bet that most will rejoice emma wilkins is a tasmanian journalist and freelance writer,2023-06,one memorable

i cant fit myself under the bed well i can but only by lying in profile as it doesnt have enough clearance for my nose my large beak is a genetic trait my son has not yet inherited and its something which he finds unaccountably hilarious we need a laugh because hes under the bed again sometimes we see the fuse snap in person other times we only realise hes gone when we hear the upstairs thumping of short angry legs and the telltale sweep of a slowly closing bedroom door hed prefer to slam it of course but its a little too flush with the carpet very nearly five my son is now less likely to throw the tantrums that typified his twos and threes these you might recall were thrilling primal things great big explosions in primary colours alarming in their fierceness and sincerity hed stamp his feet and clench his fists and say things like i feel like an incredible hulk except he couldnt quite pronounce hulk properly and thus was reduced to saying i feel like an incredible hug these days such outbursts are rare and weve watched with amazement as hes grown to share and even compromise with a maturity thats startling to see especially in someone who still thinks all cats are girls and all dogs are boys this makes his recent strops all the more difficult to watch since theyre not so much tantrums as grand sulks the triggers are common sharing having a toy taken off him by a friend or detecting that someone is treating him unkindly laughter too has become a touchy subject and to mistime any laughter in his direction is like buying him a oneway ticket to the underside of bedsville my inlaws were here when he came home from school with a union jack hed made for the coronation from an artistic standpoint my wife was delighted at his handiwork say what you want about the british flag it is difficult to draw but thought her parents would get a kick out of seeing their english grandson waving it in their faces she was right but phrased this poorly go out to the garden and show them theyll laugh she said why he asked his nose already crinkling why would they laugh at meeeeeeee an ascending scale of vowels trailed all the way up to his sulking place which is where i find him minutes later i reach in to console him hoping to hold his hand as i speak but finding only his leg so i hold that instead i tell him no one was laughing at him and that its hard to feel like people dont take you or your art seriously i tell him it looks nice and cosy under there but i cant fit im not coming out he says with the slightest hint of a chuckle at his ungainly father all right then i say grunting like a washed pig as i slide myself in beside him i cant move my head but its pointed straight at him as he begins to laugh dont move he says as the hysterics take over youll hurt

the uks controversial twochild benefit limit which restricts welfare payments to larger families in an attempt to force parents to find work has failed to increase employment levels but it has left hundreds of thousands of households in poverty according to the first study of its kind the government introduced the twochild limit in arguing that removing eligibility for benefits worth a year per child for a familys third and subsequent children would incentivise parents to move into work or work more hours to make up the difference however the study says the policys impoverishment of larger lowincome households has helped few parents get a job instead its main function has been to push families further into poverty and damage their mental health we found that rather than increasing employment the twochild limit increases poverty and hardship and that this can actually make it harder for parents to take up work said kitty stewart a coauthor of the study and an associate professor of social policy at the london school of economics the policy called the worst social security policy ever by one academic expert shortly after its introduction is now estimated to affect about million children with more than a million of them growing up in poverty more than half the households affected are working families the study says the twochild policy fails to understand how and why parents in larger lowincome families prioritise caring roles over work it underplays many of the costs and complications of moving into work while bringing up young children such as finding accessible and affordable childcare impoverishing larger families because the parents actively choose to look after their youngest children appears to be ineffective at best and discriminatory and harmful at worst the study says it is scathing about the design of the policy suggesting it relies on theoretical economic models that assume reductions in benefits would automatically increase labour supply through an income effect incentive an effect evidence shows to be weak or nonexistent in practice many parents hit by the limit said they found it harder to enter paid work because they could no longer afford skills training or to buy equipment for fledgling businesses financial difficulties caused by the policy also led to a deterioration in their mental health a key lesson the study says is that policymakers need to understand the everyday lives of those in receipt of social security before designing and predicting the effects of welfare reforms a failure to do so can in cases like this preclude the main aims of the policy from being realised while creating significant harms to affected families the architect of the policy one of many austerityera benefit reforms is the former chancellor george osborne he announced it in amid media hysteria surrounding benefits broods large families supposedly having several children to exploit an allegedly overgenerous welfare system the policy was later savaged by tory former welfare reform minister david freud who called it vicious and an excrescence and said it should be scrapped he claimed the policy was forced on a reluctant department for work and pensions dwp by the treasury as the price of introducing universal credit research published last year found the twochild limit hailed by one minister as a way of teaching lowincome families that children cost money has had little impact on restricting family size since the policys introduction the fertility rate for third and subsequent children born to poorer families has barely fallen a dwp spokesperson said we want to help more parents to reenter and progress in work and encourage them to consider our childcare offers which we are boosting to help lowincome families the twochild policy asks families on benefits to make the same financial decisions as families supporting themselves solely through work and there continues to be careful exemptions and safeguards in place within the policy to protect people in the most vulnerable circumstances,2023-06,uk controversial twochild benefit limit restricts welfare payment larger family attempt force

i dont know whose idea it was to take my father out for the day but it was me who suggested the cinema my brother dara and i were back in derry for the weekend to celebrate our dads th birthday and such visits typically involve us staying out in his house in the sticks where he lives with my sister caoimhe and her husband eddie his favourite son and making occasional trips for provisions to the city we spend the rest of our time harassing him to talk about the olden days which he doesnt much care to do to distract him from giving us jobs to do around the house which he very much does in this way it is a regression to childhood which was apt as we had both travelled without kids even five years in acting like a parent around him gives me impostor syndrome theres something about juggling babies or scolding children and then being marched up to the attic to find a very important piece of wood which my dad needs right this minute that makes me feel like a small boy playing at being a

instruction from me on what was going on he certainly didnt evince much interest in my treatise on the series unwieldy naming schema hamstrung by their insistence on keeping the colon between mission and impossible for the first one and refusing to include another resulting in titles that now sound like runon sentences pronounced by a breathless toddler its near threehour length was a bit of a

single mothers on postgraduate courses say they are being unfairly pursued by the department for work and pensions dwp over thousands of pounds in benefits which officials claim were paid in error one researcher faces a demand of more than after having been told she was entitled to claim universal credit campaigners are calling for an urgent review ruth talbot the founder of the campaign group single parent rights said the dwp was making errors in the calculation of benefits and in its repayment demands which were causing hardship and distress for single mothers including those studying for further qualifications she said the dwps policy of demanding large repayments from singleparent families for official errors is completely unacceptable and leaves many families struggling in the midst of a cost of living crisis if the dwp makes overpayments any subsequent demands for repayments must be made in a timely transparent and reasonable manner the dwp must also shoulder some of the financial burden for their own mistakes universal credit was introduced in the welfare reform act and replaced six legacy benefits and tax credits including income support child tax credit and housing benefit the dwp estimates that in there were about m of overpayments of universal credit caused by official error it says it can demand overpayments back from claimants but the high court ruled in a case in february that its decision not to waive recovery from a claimant who provided all relevant facts and would suffer hardship was unlawful single parents who are in further education are advised on the government website they may be able to claim universal credit if they are responsible for a child some single parents who have claimed after providing all information to the dwp have later been landed with large repayments demands penny davis an artist from loughborough who has three children faces a demand of from the dwp after she claimed universal credit while taking a break for family reasons from her phd in drawing and maternal subjectivity at loughborough university she was in receipt of a university scholarship for her living costs while studying but it was suspended during her leave of absence from january to september last year she provided all relevant information to the dwp and was paid universal credit worth up to a month during the period she was not receiving any grant the dwp said she owed the money after she notified the department she was returning to her studies last september the dwp said its rules were that anyone taking a break from studies must be treated as receiving the same income from any student loan as prior to the suspension of their studies davis is not in receipt of a loan so the rules cited appear to be irrelevant the dwp rejected an appeal and she is now appealing to the social security and child support tribunal she said it has pushed me into a desperate situation where i can no longer claim anything i have got massive credit card debts just on my living costs jane wardle from darlington who has a yearold daughter started a phd at teesside university funded by the economic and social research council in october and was told by a dwp agent she was entitled to universal credit she changed to parttime studies in may because of illness and requiring more time to look after her daughter she was issued with a demand for

and then youre penalised because you are a single parent this overpayment will not only push me into extreme financial hardship but the stress as a result of this will have a severe impact on my physical and mental health and have a knockon effect on my daughter like davis wardle is now appealing to the social security and child support tribunal a government spokesperson said we apologise for any error caused generally students access fees and living costs support for their higher education courses through various loans and grants funded through the student support system it is important

rishi sunak has been warned that highprofile plans for a huge expansion of free childcare are undeliverable as hundreds of nurseries across england said it would lead to a chronic shortage of places and leave many parents still having to pay a survey of hundreds of childcare providers seen by the observer reveals a sizeable mismatch between the free places parents are expecting and what nurseries and childminders can provide they also warn that many parents will continue to be charged or face higher fees as providers face a growing shortfall the conservatives regard the proposals on childcare as a key part of their election pitch to voters the chancellor jeremy hunt used his budget in march to announce eyecatching plans to extend the governments existing offer of hours of free childcare to children aged between nine months and two years by however with eligible parents expecting the free hours and nurseries already facing surging inquiries for when the full package is introduced the vast majority of childcare providers said they were not planning to increase their capacity due to costs staffing levels or the space they had available more than of all providers surveyed said their service was already full with a waiting list the findings come from a nationwide survey of about providers by the early years alliance shared with the observer of the of respondents who currently offer places to twoyearolds plan to offer a limited number of places under the governments scheme and charge privately for the rest another said they were unsure whether they would deliver places under the new scheme of the of providers who currently offer places to oneyearolds are undecided about delivering new funded places while plan to offer a limited number and charge privately for the rest among providers planning to offer places under the scheme for twoyearolds expected an increase in demand of these were not planning to increase the number of places offered some of those planning to offer oneyearold places anticipated higher demand but were not planning to increase places concern is acute because childcare providers have traditionally used the fees provided by younger children to cover the shortfall created by the free provision handed to three and fouryearolds in reality they say state funding for older children has never covered their real costs under the expanded scheme they will have less scope to make their services economically viable even before the new offer kicks in of nurseries and childminders currently offering funded places for three and fouryearold children said the government funding pledged from september would be less than the cost of delivering the places some said they would cope by increasing fees neil leitch chief executive of the early years alliance said the government had blindly made a promise to families that many providers simply will not be able to deliver on he said a combination of poor funding a lack of capacity and insufficient time to prepare means that many preschools nurseries and childminders may quite understandably choose to limit the number of funded places available under the expanded offer or in some cases opt out entirely as a result many of the parents and carers who are pinning their hopes on benefiting from the new offers when they roll out next year are likely to be left sorely disappointed bridget phillipson the shadow education secretary accused the government of trying to hoodwink parents with the pledge these findings suggest that the chancellor has written a postdated cheque to britains children and at this rate the cheque will bounce the department for education said we are rolling out the single biggest investment in childcare in england ever set to save a working parent using hours of childcare up to an average of a year to make sure there are enough places across the country we will be investing hundreds of millions of pounds each year to increase the amounts we pay providers and are consulting on how we distribute funding to make sure it is fair the early years alliance carried out its survey of members between and july the nursery manager there wont be enough spaces it is still more than two years until working parents of children aged between nine months and two years are given hours of supposedly free childcare yet mihaela fulga the manager of meadow view childcare in welwyn hertfordshire is already worried about what parents are expecting and what she and her counterparts will be able to deliver we already have inquiries about places for she says parents want places for september we have six or seven visits a week now from parents since the government announced this plan the parents want to make sure they will get the space because they know there will not be spaces for everybody eleanor lucas the nurserys business manager added the government again has clearly underestimated what early years providers need to keep their doors open to provide highquality practitioners and care we are the forgotten sector the introduction of hours of free childcare for eligible working parents which chancellor jeremy hunt promised by the end of has not only created a worrying gap between what parents think they have been promised and what many nurseries think they can deliver it has also left nurseries with unanswered questions about how they will fund the places working parents are currently given hours of supposedly free childcare for three and fouryearolds but fulga said that in reality these places were not fully funded by the state in fact they are crosssubsidised by the fees paid by parents of younger children expanding free hours to younger children has left nurseries questioning how they will cope or whether they will simply not take part in the government scheme or charge some parents even more she said all her costs were going up and she didnt want to save money by easing staffing ratios as ministers have allowed nurseries to do in our opinion it is not really safe she said its not because something will happen with the children you would overwork the staff they are already overworked anyway,2023-07,rishi sunak ha

since becoming a parent i no longer have much time there are unread emails in my inbox and i only recently got a pedicure despite the fact that its been at least months since ive been able to see my feet again but it turns out that i do have time to be properly livid with the labour party which is refusing to budge on its failure to promise to scrap the twochild benefits policy despite the fact that it has pushed a quarter of a million children into poverty and even deeper below the breadline perhaps its tone deaf to talk of pedicures in the same breath as child poverty but these small things mothers do for themselves getting our roots done or even just a long hot bath help us stay sane the toll that parenting takes on your body doesnt stop after birth it is physical boneaching work and birth of course can lead to myriad longterm health issues these small acts of selfcare matter they make us feel worth something they are also the first things to go in times of financial hardship we all make sacrifices for our childrens wellbeing to different extents and in a cost of living crisis money for such things might be needed elsewhere pedicures are the least of it there will be many women going hungry in this country today so that their children can eat the effects of the twochild policy which limits benefits to the first two children born into a family have been widely and rightly condemned the bitter internal row in the labour party over this especially cruel and nasty legislation shows what an emotive issue it is it goes without saying that punishing innocent children for their parents apparent reproductive profligacy is a heinous political strategy and for what it hasnt even worked the social policy professor jonathan bradshaw has called it morally odious and worse than the legislation that brought workhouses into existence considering how that policy broke up families starved children and essentially warehoused undesirables in a way the nazis would later replicate that is quite a strong statement but what is less discussed and which i cant stop thinking about is its impact on the female body philip alston the uns then rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights said that the uks benefits system was so sexist that it might as well have been conceived by a group of misogynists in a room determined to make a system that works for men and not women there was rightly outrage about the rape clause in this policy that requires that women who have had a third child as a result of rape prove it to the government in order to claim for benefits but less about the fact that the reproductive rights of every single woman in the uk have been quietly encroached upon essentially what we have here is the legislating of the female body in plain sight yet with none of the outrage and fury that we see over abortion rights in forcing women to choose between abortion and poverty the policy appears specifically designed to limit womens reproductive choices but because i suspect societal ideas about workingclass maternal fecklessness are so ingrained even people who consider themselves socially progressive might um and ah when asked their views on women on benefits reproducing and so there are no marches two years ago two single mothers and their children valiantly challenged the legislation in court on the basis that it was discriminatory but they lost it was noted in the coverage that one of the mothers had become pregnant despite being on the pill and that the other was in lowpaid work ie they were the right sort of single mothers in the judgment the supreme court president lord reed said that while the policy had a disproportionate impact on women parliament had decided that was outweighed by the importance of its economic aims how chilling i find that sentence how chilling we should all find it but as my own single mother frequently says twas ever thus our bodies are under the bus again and scarcely anyone seems to care they are i suppose the wrong sorts of bodies poor bodies black and brown bodies the policy disproportionally affects women of colour disabled bodies even if your body is none of these things and youre one of the women getting monthly pedicures it is a dangerous precedent that has been set and in the spirit of maternal nay female solidarity we should all abhor it as sian norris the author of bodies under siege tells me the twochild policy seeks to legislate over womens bodies treating womens wombs as something that can and should be arbitrated on by the state it ties into ideas of womens wombs being public property which in turn links to antiabortion ideology ironic considering the policy is pushing some women to terminate wanted pregnancies as they cant afford to care for a third or fourth child she added there is a specific classbased element to this that states that if you are on a lowincome then you are not entitled to make your own decisions about pregnancy fertility and your family a labour party without the moral courage to challenge this policy is unworthy of the name set against the background of demographic panic about the birthrate its stance is even more nonsensical the birthrate is plummeting and women are ending wanted pregnancies in the british pregnancy advisory service noted that since the policy was introduced the proportion of abortions to women with two or more children had risen by theyre the wrong sort of women to be having babies though we dont want migrant or impoverished mothers and we dont want their children who if they have the audacity to exist must be punished we want only the right sort twas ever thus rhiannon lucy cosslett is a guardian columnist do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article if you would like to submit a

a third of parents with young children in england say they are struggling to afford childcare the highest number in almost a decade according to a government survey one in three of those with children aged four or younger who responded to the survey carried out by ipsos on behalf of the department for education said they struggled to meet childcare costs in this marks the highest proportion of parents who said they found it difficult or very difficult to afford childcare since just of families said the same in the last comparable prepandemic year for which data is available the study also showed an increase in parents saying they had difficulties finding a suitable childcare place while of families with children aged four and under said there were not enough places in that figure had risen to in the data also shows fewer older children attending childcare the proportion of to yearolds in either paidfor or informal childcare usually meaning that they are being looked after by a grandparent or other family member fell from in to last year overall the proportion of unders in childcare dropped from in to last year close to twothirds of the parents surveyed who were not using childcare in the past year said this was out of choice but families with children aged four and under were more likely to say they could not find a place or could not afford to do so almost one in five parents of underfives said it was down to childcare being unaffordable compared with among parents with children aged five to there has also been a rise in parents saying they have struggled to find the right care for their child with of those surveyed in reporting problems finding flexible childcare to meet their needs compared with of the respondents in megan jarvie the head of coram family and childcare said that the governments childcare expansion due to start in april was welcomed by parents struggling with high bills but unless there is also action to support childcare providers these plans will not live up to parents expectations she added highquality childcare can help boost childrens outcomes and narrow the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers which opens up before they even start school but a third of local areas do not have enough childcare for disadvantaged twoyearolds the very children who stand to benefit the most a government spokesperson said these findings demonstrate how important our biggest ever investment into childcare is it will save a working parent using hours of childcare up to an average of per year we have raised the amount that parents on universal credit can claim back monthly for their childcare and were investing an additional m this year to increase the rates we pay providers for places in just two months time we separately have set out our plan for working parents of older children to be able to access wraparound childcare we will continue to support fantastic workforce so that they can deliver on our

ministers should remove business rates and vat from nurseries so that they are able to pay their staff more a group of mps have recommended in the spring budget jeremy hunt pledged to reform the childcare system including by offering parents of children aged nine months to three years hours a week of free childcare in termtime which was expected to cost bn the government claimed that it would reduce childcare costs for a family by almost although the education select committee has welcomed these new childcare provisions it has also called on the government to go further in making childcare more affordable one recommendation is that nurseries in england should be exempted from business rates and vat in recognition of their role in delivering a key government policy the committee says removing these rates could lead to nursery staff being paid more the report also says the government has much more work to do to address the structural problems within early years childcare and that plans to expand the number of subsidised childcare places in england should not come at the expense of quality the report calls on the government to stop referring to its flagship childcare policy as being hours of free childcare and rather refer to it as funded or subsidised childcare hours robin walker the committee chair said nothing can be more important than the start we give children in life and early education should be at the forefront of education policy the chancellors major spending commitments to extend subsidised childcare were well intentioned and showed the government recognises the huge benefits to the country of fixing this sector highquality early education should be a win for children parents and the education system throughout this inquiry and in the incredible response from families and providers there was no shortage of people ready to point out flaws in the system but there was a great deal of praise for the brilliant people who work with young children and strong evidence that with the right support they can do more there were also an abundance of practical ideas to revive the childcare sector and update the offering to young families we look forward to the governments response to our recommendations a government spokesperson said to make sure that we are supporting our fantastic early years workforce we will be investing hundreds of millions of pounds

before we decided to have a baby i thought a lot about what being a mother would be like but there were some respects in which my imagination failed me both are related to my living environment i live in a firstfloor flat with quite a few steps leading up to the front door from street level and it did not occur to me that this would be what might politely be termed a complete and utter ballache both in respect of getting myself and the baby outside but also his many effects meaning it requires at least two trips and unless i am using the babyzen yoyo which is extremely light the assistance of my husband or sometimes my very kind neighbour without that pram and someone there to assist id basically be housebound which makes me feel pathetic and a tad vulnerable for a while i could pop the baby on a blanket in the communal hall while lugging the pram down the steps but now that he is mobile hes on a kamikaze mission to go headfirst after me the other was toys for some reason i had not realised that there would be so many toys and that not tripping over those toys in the dark at am when retrieving a bottle would become quite key so when a friend falls pregnant now i tend to gently highlight these two things especially the former so that she can be prepared although what tends to happen is that her housing situation comes with its own issues as in the case of the friend who moved to a ground floor apartment in preparation but has found the neighbourhood outside it to feel crimeridden and lacking in green space having a baby changes your approach to housing both in a practical and an emotional sense the way you use space changes as does the way that you feel within that space its all for someone else now and so your homes shortcomings feel more depressing and distressing than ever i write this as a renter in an area that has gentrified so completely in the past decade that any former resident who comes to see you spends at least the first minutes swearing in disbelief as such its been a lovely place in which to have a baby and there is still a feeling of community here on the other hand it can be quite fatiguing being surrounded by millionaires and now that im a parent the absurdity of the wealth divide in my borough hits even harder that there should be babies in beautifully appointed nurseries in victorian townhouses all decorated in various shades of sad beige the satirical term used to describe the way uppermiddle class parents eschew colour in pursuit of a scandi aesthetic a stones throw from children living in appalling cramped conditions it breaks my heart its not that i begrudge the friends and acquaintances who have made it on to the property ladder most of them usually with huge cash injections from family they are admirably candid about this but living sidebyside with them at times makes that lifestyle feel achievable when in fact you might as well wish that you had won the lottery so successful has been the media manipulation around the housing crisis that to be renting at my age and stage of life feels like a personal failure even though i know objectively that it isnt at one point a few years ago buying a house somewhere else in the uk started to look possibly achievable though relocation workwise would have been a challenge and then liz truss happened there are many thousands of others in the same boat or worse off and many thousands of others living with mortgage terror working multiple jobs in fear of losing their homes the social contract in terms of being able to provide an affordable comfortable home for your family by working hard has completely broken down the landlord class continues to leech off the younger and the poorer i think about the parents who are waiting to have the lift repaired for the seventh time the ones who already have too many children in too little space or who have decided that they cant have another despite desperately wanting one because theres nowhere to put them i think a lot about awaab ishak the twoyearold boy who died because of a respiratory condition caused by exposure to mould at his rochdale home especially last winter when the black mould bloomed on our own windowsills and while my husband scrubbed and scrubbed i sobbed and sobbed because our son had needed help to breathe when he was born early and i was scared for his tiny lungs i couldnt write about it at the time i felt ashamed because how could someone with all my privileges someone writing a parenting column for a national newspaper be in such a situation i consider myself lucky i have a landlord clarion housing that will eventually replace the windows though it took two years for them to fix the crumbling brickwork that made my sons room so damp and they are yet to make the collapsing wall in the back garden safe or provide an outside tap for a paddling pool or fix the hob in the kitchen but its better than what most tenants get the bar is very low if youre reading this in your beautiful secure home you are one of the fortunate ones there are millions of parents out there who are not i suppose i want them to feel seen because it used to be taken for granted that you could give your children a better life than you yourself had and in the past decade weve lost that principle i dont know how we find it again whats working colin and zach the paramedics who took my son to hospital last weekend and were so kind to us the baby is now on the mend you joked that id write about you in the guardian so here i am doing it thank you i couldnt be more grateful for you and our nhs whats not my husband has noticed an alarming number of viral funny kid videos in which parents deliberately make their children cry i feel queasy enough about putting children on social media without their consent but to upset them and then film it seems doubly cruel if someone treated their pet in such a way for the cynical reason of simply getting likes

thousands of parents could be freed from the chore of having to fill in a selfassessment tax form after the government announced changes to a tax charge that affects higher earners ministers have said that in future those in work who are affected by the high income child benefit charge which affects people earning more than a year and their partners will not have to register for selfassessment in order to pay what they owe instead the money will be clawed back via peoples paye tax codes which experts said should tackle the problem of families being hit with fines for inadvertently not paying the charge the high income child benefit charge has been controversial since it was introduced in and steve webb the former pensions minister said the move to simplify the rules is welcome just years too late child benefit is not meanstested and the charge is the governments way of reducing the amount that is paid to higher earners it means some of the state payment is clawed back via the tax system where a parent earns more than dubbed by some as a tax on children the charge has resulted in large numbers of parents repaying some or all of the benefit which is paid at a week for the eldest or only child then a week for each additional child about individuals were hit with the charge in and it raised m for the governments coffers that year alone however as of august more than families had opted out of receiving child benefit to avoid being hit by the charge one reason it is controversial is that as the association of taxation technicians explained a combination of frozen tax thresholds and wages rising with inflation have dragged more parents into the charges net the investment firm quilter said that if the threshold had been increased in line with inflation it would be above today the charge is of the amount of child benefit for each of income on a sliding scale between and for those earning more than the charge is in effect they receive no child benefit in a statement the government said it wanted to simplify the process and would provide details later on how it would enable employed people affected by the child benefit tax charge to pay it through their tax code without the need to register for selfassessment sarah coles the head of personal finance at the investment platform hargreaves lansdown said this meant parents earning just over wont need to go through the pointless rigmarole of registering for selfassessment purely in order to repay a chunk of child benefit webb now a partner at the actuarial business lcp said one of the many flaws of the high income child benefit charge is the way it has caught thousands of families unawares parents with simple tax affairs who would not normally have to fill in a tax return have needed to do so once their annual income exceeded those who have failed to do so often simply through lack of awareness of the system have had to pay the charges and have also faced fines,2023-07,thousand parent

as a single parent i feel like im letting my kids down one mother of five affected by the twochild benefits limit who did not want to be named told the guardian she said she is on antidepressants and skipping meals about one in children are affected by the twochild benefit limit a policy introduced by george osborne that prevents parents from claiming child tax credit or universal credit for any third or subsequent child born after april labour has now said it will keep this policy which has been blamed for pushing families into poverty ive had to cut down i only eat once a day now the woman said i cant eat two meals a day because im so used to it she has five children aged eight and four the youngest one i dont get anything for her she said the benefits cap has made her situation worse people dont realise how bad the benefit cap is she said even though four of my kids are eligible for the child tax credit the benefit cap means i get the equivalent support for only two of them i dont think they realise how much of an effect it has on peoples mental health she added i am on antidepressants with financial stress being one of the reasons the twochild benefit cap was introduced as a way of encouraging parents back into work if i could work i would but i only have two to three hours free she said even then i couldnt afford to get childcare and with my mental state right now i couldnt work her children have also been affected i usually only take the youngest ones out the older ones understand the younger ones dont know better but the older ones it affects them more she said when they want or need something they have to wait luckily my kids are very understanding when i tell them i havent got the money they understand she said she is not totally against the twochild limit i do think they need to look at cases separately in my case i had no choice but to get out of my relationship while i was pregnant people do have accidents and you can fall pregnant i dont think

my son has turned five and the temptation is to say that this seems ludicrous my little boy all grown up a man of the world already that kind of thing in truth i dont really feel that way at all ive been keeping pretty meticulous records of my calendar and the numbers appear to check out plus he is ft tall and closing out his first year of primary school so yes five does seem about right i dont however say this out loud when fellow parents at his small birthday gathering ask where the time went i just say wow yeah can you believe it even though i can believe it perfectly well theres a mote of shame in this as if the best thing i can say about my son is that i feel like ive only known him for a wet weekend maybe i counsel myself the passage of time has simply been complicated by covid lockdowns which took up a decent chunk of his toddler years indeed stretched them to nearpurgatorial lengths this theory hits a snag when i consider that this has been true for every parent i know and they all seem utterly perplexed at the speed of the earths orbit i picture them now leaving with their party bags wordless and disconsolate returning indoors to crunch numbers on battered calculators and scream at the hundred calendars theyve connected with red twine across their kitchen wall or maybe im being too literal and its just something you say and especially about nice things time flies when youre having fun and all that well my son turning five has been extremely fun his party was small because he tends to become overwhelmed with big groups overwhelmed here is a euphemism for extremely unreasonable we had a handful of family and friends there who well and truly spoiled him with presents his favourite was the globe he got from his nana and grandad it lights up and plays videos about any place you press with a stylus and different settings tell you about that countrys culture animals flags or landmarks you can even press a specific point of the oceans and it will tell you what marine life lives there i watch as he prods it and repeats facts about the migratory patterns of the basking shark or the megafauna of madagascar soon i am dispatched to the globes ancillary website to download an addon which does the same but for all the dinosaurs that have been found on any corner of the globe you care to point to he is generous to friends and cousins when they ask for a go and even shows his baby sister the screen any time a seal pops up that being the genus of her favourite toy it is thrilling to watch him aswim with wonder laughing at everything the planet has to

parents across the uk are forming partnerships with local councils to build pioneering supportedliving homes for their autistic children with high needs with growing numbers of parents increasingly unable to find suitable safe and secure residential accommodation for their young adult children and cashstrapped councils having to pay exorbitant costs when already expensive placements break down the two are coming together to forge a solution the breakthrough is based on the success story of linden farm built by the simon trust and surrey county council working together in what is thought to be the first venture of its kind the simon trust was set up after sally and peter lawrence parents of simon were told by their local authority that there was nowhere local for their yearold son to live once he moved out of the residential school that had been his home since he was eight years old refusing to send simon whose needs are highly complex to live in another county the lawrences persuaded their council to buy a local hectare acre site they then formed a charity raised and worked together with the council to create the bed linden farm which offers accommodation activities and specialised care for autistic adults with complex needs since setting up linden farm we have been inundated with parents absolutely desperate to find somewhere for their children to go once they enter adult social services said sally lawrence theres barely anything available across the uk we started putting these parents together saying that if they were determined and had a lot of time and energy they could do what we did peter lawrence said it was an automatic response of social services to send young adults out of county but it was potentially a recipe for other problems such as poor or inappropriate care mark nuti surrey county councils cabinet member for adults and health said were pleased that linden farm has come to fruition and we value our partnership with the simon trust the lawrences are now helping five parent groups to bring similar schemes to fruition sarah the mother of a severely autistic young adult recently submitted a proposal to her local council my son is severely autistic nonverbal and has severe learning disabilities she said it was horrific enough to have to send him as a sevenyearold to a different part of the country to live because there was nowhere for him in our county but now hes an adult provision is even worse there isnt anywhere suitable another parent who is also working on a proposal for their council who asked not to be named said the current situation in my area is unbelievably bad for profoundly autistic adults weve got no choice but to create something ourselves there is no money available and everyone we speak to tells of atrocities of autistic folk being placed in unsuitable settings which then break down and end up costing millions in psychiatric care plus all the trauma associated with that were not prepared to let our child go down that route they added fraser hardie the chair of the autism centre of excellence in cambridge said there is a crisis playing out in this country if youre autistic in my county there are between to children who will need this care in the next five years and literally nothing for them in the health foundation estimated that turning around the crisis in adult social care would

new childrens care homes are being disproportionately placed in cheaper and more deprived parts of england according to an observer investigation over the past five years the number of childrens care homes located in areas with the cheapest house sale prices has risen almost three times faster than in the most expensive places among the regions with big increases in homes was the northwest including in parts of blackpool and burnley and other northern cities such as bradford childrens services directors warned that the trends were driven by the blatant profiteering of private care providers targeting cheap housing and local labour the findings suggest private companies are locating homes where it is cheapest for them to do so rather than where they are needed the practice helps them increase profits however it also means vulnerable children can end up being moved hundreds of miles for a care place splitting them from family and support networks that they rely on it comes after the observer revealed that some children were being moved to care homes more than miles away from their neighbourhoods almost one in five of the care homes opened in the past decade was located in areas with the cheapest house sale prices as opposed to one in every in the most expensive areas in response to the findings tory mps representing some of the areas said the care system was failing miserably and stated they would be seeking answers from ministers josh macalister the author of an independent review of childrens care said it was the latest evidence to show that the childrens social care market is broken the findings raised concerns with local mps and childrens services directors who said provision should not be driven by profit a review by the competition and markets authority last year found that the average operating profit per child in england was with profit margins averaging the only thing that should guide where children in care are placed is where they can best be supported said antony higginbotham the tory mp for burnley in the vast majority of cases except where there is a safeguarding need thats in the place where they have access to friends family and a support network its clear from these numbers though that property prices are taking priority over what is best for those vulnerable children its not acceptable and ill be raising it with government paul maynard and scott benton the two tory mps for blackpool also raised concerns maynard said that planning law changes were helping to tackle the problem which was becoming less acute in the town but said the care market was dysfunctional it would be cheaper to send these children to our local public school as boarders than it is to accommodate them in some of these properties he said benton said from the exchequers point of view from a public policy point of view and more importantly from a childs point of view this policy fails miserably from a childs point of view it can be catastrophic and it clearly isnt in the childrens best interests macalister whose review recommended a fiveyear bn plan to tackle the childrens social care crisis said the clock is ticking for action where children in care live should not be influenced by house prices but by a focus on keeping them close to their friends family networks and school in homes that provide them with stable loving relationships he added clare bracey policy director at the become charity that helps those in care and care leavers said the housing market was having far too big an influence on the childrens care system we should expect children to be living in safe nurturing communities she said where children are being moved to places far away and to a more deprived area thats not in the best interests of children either we have a huge number of children being placed far away from the people that matter to them from their schools their communities john pearce the president of the association of directors of childrens services said that the placement of homes in poorer cheaper areas was part of the blatant profiteering in the sector and called for a plan to move away from the profit motive in care louise gittins chair of the local government associations children and young people board said there had been complaints for years of many childrens homes being concentrated in areas where property is cheaper many councils are now developing their own childrens homes to tackle this problem she said however in a context of significant pressure on council finances this is a challenge the observer matched registered care homes against the level of deprivation and house selling prices in the parliamentary constituencies they are located in the number of homes increased by in areas with the lowest housing prices between march and august that compares with the increase in five years in the areas where houses were sold at the most expensive price there also appears to be a disproportionate number of homes in the northwest compared with more expensive regions in the northwest had a quarter of all the care homes in england the region is home to just of englands under population the number of care places available in childrens care homes increased by between and in areas with the cheapest house sale prices compared with a decrease of in the most expensive parts of england analysis of official figures published by ofsted also shows that places have increased four times faster in the most deprived areas of england between and places went up by in the most deprived areas compared with a rise in the least deprived some of the most deprived constituencies with the cheapest housing had some of the biggest increases in childrens homes blackpool south has seen the number of care homes increase from to over the period the number in burnley has increased from four to there was an increase from one to homes in wolverhampton north east and three to in wolverhampton south east homes in bradford south increased from two to and in bradford west from one to four a department for education spokesperson said every child deserves to live in a safe and stable home local authorities have a responsibility to place children in an environment that is in their best interests as part of childrens social care reforms we are investing m to create more placements for children in highquality and safe homes we are also working with ofsted and the childrens homes sector to develop a robust financial oversight regime to make sure we have greater transparency of ownership debt structures and profitmaking preventing sudden market exit and making sure that children receive the care that they need there was no warning or anything i cried all the way no other kids were there jade barnett was just when she returned from school to her foster home to be told she would be moving to blackpool after entering the care system at in the south she had already relocated to birmingham unsurprisingly the sudden news that she would be moving to a new town completely unknown to her was hard to process at first i tried to run because i didnt want to go to blackpool she said i tried to get some of my stuff but everything was gone from my room already i literally had no way to do anything i had nothing i felt angry there was no warning or anything they were literally waiting for me to get home so i could go she was put in a black cab and sent to her new home that evening i cried all the way she said by then it was pretty late no other kids were up when i got there there were two staff members who showed me to my room you could literally see the seaside it was right on my doorstep i think thats probably when i realised i was in a completely new place jades experience reflects the revelations from the observers investigation which found childrens care homes have been disproportionately located in poorer cheaper areas over the past five years as companies behind them target cheap housing and labour it means vulnerable children are being forced to relocate to available housing rather than homes being located where there is the most need parts of blackpool are some of the cheapest and most deprived in england at one point most of the children in jades blackpool home were from london she said she did not go out much and felt alienated in the area when she did one stranger asked to touch her hair when it was in an afro style youd walk down the road and there would not be a lot of people that looked like you she said it was weird because i had to be put in situations sometimes that id never been in before that made me feel uncomfortable jim hobson blackpool councils cabinet member for childrens services said the town was tackling the boom in childrens homes by changing planning rules but criticised providers targeting the area for profit many are opening their homes in places like blackpool for profit motives and not for the best interests of the children in their care he said the reason for this is that the property prices in such places are low due to these areas suffering with higher than average levels of deprivation and all of the knockon problems associated with that the significant growth in private childrens homes especially those run for profit is concerning and a distraction from work that we should see which is more foster homes and greater support including policy support and funding from national government to help struggling families stay together jade now has been able to channel what she has been through and now tries to help other young people facing hardship working with the princes trust on youth development and with the mayor of london on reducing youth violence ive used my

im not really in the habit of recommending parenting hacks but one ive always liked is presenting commands as choices if for example i ask my son if he wants veg with dinner hell offer a comprehensive no but if i ask whether hed prefer peas or carrots hell pick one that he usually refuses to eat whatever hes picked is of course regrettable but thats why im not a professional supernanny i do now have an unlikely ally in this fight however and his name is bear grylls my sons new favourite show is you vs wild an interactive series in which you pilot bear grylls through survival situations like a painseeking voodoo doll it should be said that bears idea of likely survival situations could charitably be described as speculative i laugh smugly as my son tells me sleepily after three backtoback episodes that the best way to struggle out of a sinking bog is to move as little as possible i dont think thatll come up any time soon i chuckle before an inward glance reminds me that i spend the entirety of our watches attempting to memorise these selfsame strategies im reasonably confident the shows fanbase contains as many men my age as it does children under i reckon kids love bear because he affirms their own sense of invincibility a confidence that given the opportunity they probably could parachute into the jungle and build an entirely new airplane from the trees rocks and animal droppings my theory is that he appeals to men approaching middle age for precisely the opposite reason we are disconcertingly aware of our own mortal uselessness and his promise to help us cheat death even from threats abstracted to the point of absurdity provides a welcome palliative to put it another way believing youd withstand a bear attack when youre five feels cool to do so when you routinely get dizzy if you stand up too quick is near euphoric at each big decision bear gives you the pros and cons of two options before asking you to pick up your remote and choose whether he should for example eat berries or moss make camp or hunt for food or this being bear grylls eat animal faeces or not its your choice he says before adding with a gravitas known only to those who recreationally drink wolf piss you decide it is quite simply an impeccable televisual format more importantly his signature catchphrase is one i can now use to get my son to do anything peaaaas i say exaggerating the vowel sounds in an impression of bear im unduly proud of theyre small but they pack a lot of taste and energy or caaaarrots theyre bigger come in funkier colours and help you see in the dark its your choice you decide to my astonishment he doesnt just pick the peas or carrots but eats them i use the same tactics for choosing books before bedtime and getting his socks on before school i

sorry to break it to all the other parents out there but my toddler is objectively speaking the cutest child in the world she is an absolute cherub a delight and a privilege to be around especially in the economyminusclass cabin of a cramped transatlantic flight when she is belting out twinkle twinkle little star at the top of her lungs for the fourth time in a row while everyone else is trying to get some sleep ok maybe not then even with my besottedparent goggles on i am fully aware that being forced into close proximity to other peoples children is no fun particularly on an aeroplane heck being in close proximity to your own children on a flight isnt fun im still recovering from my recent flight en famille to the uk highlights of which included my toddler singing every song she knows then announcing that she was going to throw up just as the plane started to descend luckily for everyone on the flight she waited until the taxi ride to vomit all of which is to say that even as a parent i am in full support of childfree spaces an increasing number of pubs and restaurants are implementing childfree policies and airlines are also getting in on the act turkishowned corendon airlines has announced it is introducing childfree zones on one of its routes a few other carriers such as airasia have already trialled childfree seating and im sure others will follow the only thing more stressful than your kid announcing that she is going to vomit on a plane is having to endure the alarmed looks of the childfree passengers nearby still lets not stop with childfree zones my toddler might get motionsickness but putting my besottedparent goggles back on she still behaves better than many grownups including the person in front of me who fully reclined their seat the moment the fasten seatbelts sign was turned off if you want to unnecessarily recline your seat you should be banished to a zone of your own arwa mahdawi is a guardian columnist,2023-08,sorry break parent

as the end of my last childs schooling approaches im thinking about freedom i know once youve had children you always have them francis bacon called them hostages to fortune for they are impediments to great enterprises i dont want my children gone for ever nor do i have any great enterprises in mind like you i just need a rest im so sick of being a good parent a good enough parent an ok parent a shitty parent recently i found something id written in when my kids were two and six brace yourself the thing about children is this they need your attention all of the time you need to be feeding them giving them drinks getting them warmer or colder stopping them from being bored what are you going to cook for dinner what will you give them for lunch how will it balance out with the dinner will they have had enough fruit and vegetables what are you supposed to do if you cant get them to eat fruit or vegetables you have to stop them from hurting themselves but allow them to take risks what if another child said something awful to them which they are worrying about but they havent told you so you cant help them what if you lost your temper and screamed at them and scared them are they getting a cold do they have cancer or are they just hungry what time honestly is it reasonable to begin drinking wine the pain in your breasts your hip behind your eyes your teeth is it normal why are you feeling dizzy in the morning where will you fit in some exercise how much can you talk on the phone how often can you sneak a look at your email looks like i had a lot on my mind our biological kids are and now and our foster daughter is while they were growing i invented a few unwritten books even gave them titles the one i really thought i would write was called menopause and the hsc however menopause scuttled that plan fun times if id written a pitch it would have read like this im anxious about everything anxious about anxiety to begin with so much of it everywhere i look anxious about phones anxious about the stupid hsc anxious about having failed to teach my kids how to clean a toilet but now our last hsc is a matter of weeks away the kids are not dead and im somewhere new somewhere we might call feeling the anxiety and giving up anyway i look at younger friends worrying about whether their kids are exposed to too much social media and are getting low selfesteem because of it and i think meh we had low selfesteem in the s let them have their phones thats where all their friends live dont lock them out of that vital conversation and yes they have seen porn it wont kill them i look at younger friends locked in ceaseless battle over screen time an expression i never want to and dont have to hear ever again i remember the days of sticker charts and timed gaming goodbye sticker charts have at it kids i see friends worrying about their kids drinking and taking drugs smoking vaping and skipping school gaining or losing weight being depressed having the wrong friends no friends mean friends drugtaking friends you know what let them sort it out stand by them protect them when you can and love them pencil in a few boundaries but dont lose your shit when they cross them talk to them about anything they want to talk about and some things they dont feed them whenever they will eat encourage them not to take too many drugs to slow down to read books do not go to the wall for any of these things some of it is your fault sure so suck that up but the rest well my attitude these days can be summed up by an exchange ive been having for years with one of my closest friends when our boys are being horrible question is it something i did or is he just being a dickhead answer just being a dickhead kids are frequently dickheads but you are too go forth babies and be dickheads the world will let you know what it thinks of that and this is also true the children are beautiful they smell nice when they were little they noticed things youd long forgotten to notice like moths or sticks or stop signs they said stuff that made you gasp that realigned the way you thought about the world my daughter finding the pulse in her wrist i have a heart in my arm my son holding the hand of one of his godfathers why are the grownups in charge remember this too they used to dance when they felt like it and and skip or jump with happiness the promise of chocolate or a party made them ecstatic they helped you to grow up yourself you relatively patiently and bravely survived those long years of absolute service you finally found out what it was to work hard you learned to see life for what it really is it is so brief it is uncontrollable it cant be saved if it is going to be lost sunlight has to be seen as a gift like food the world that you brought your kids into is worse in some ways but so much better in others your kids will have space to learn themselves to find an identity that is true to who they are rather than an identity decided for them by others your kids have learned kindness and tolerance in a way you never did were a few weeks away from the beginning of spring and soon enough the final exams will begin every morning the light falls differently into the house i can track it by the cat our very own sun dial the kids are doing ok but as my partner said when they were small if theres one thing ive learned about having children its that nothing ever stays the same why are the grownups in charge who knows maybe our children will have children themselves and be surprised pleased grateful and furious with us for everything we have done maybe theyll pass on the art of loving as well as the art of screaming till your throat hurts tegan bennett daylight is the author of royals a novel for teenagers in which six kids and a baby are trapped alone in a mall and everything eventually turns out fine,2023-08,end last child schooling approach im thinking freedom know youve child always francis bacon

we are in the dregs of the english school summer holidays now all the organised fun is done and so are the adults who organised it if memory serves money time off and energy all spent round me that seems to mean kids mainly doing their own thing tinies confined to gardens are getting creative with toys or dirt or the recycling while the older ones are hanging around sitting on walls kicking a ball on the verge or riding bikes along pavements can i swerve around you one asked as i walked to the shop scoring highly on the making your own fun scale once i agreed he swerved happily around me several times then did it again when i was walking back minutes later which was very bracing is my consent to being swerved around irrevocable this could get interesting theres some chucking of apples too judging from the debris strewn around the street and my own experience one year i naively put out a bucket of cookers to give away only to face apple carnage the next morning its nice not the apples so much but the rest i find it comforting its vaguely reminiscent of my own childhood which wasnt exactly jumpers for goalposts but was certainly plenty of aimless loitering i like that about living where i do how there are kids doing kids stuff but it seems theyre lucky according to research on street play from play england published last month opportunities to play outside which were the near universal right of previous generations are now available to fewer and fewer children the saddest part for me was the percentage of children significantly more than the previous report in who have been asked to stop doing such ordinary things as making a noise sitting on a neighbours wall and hanging out in groups and what hurt was done to the people who told of kids surveyed to stop chalking on the pavement i suppose it depends what theyre chalking but wouldnt you feel like a baddie from the beano actually the people who told kids to stop doing stuff most often were parents and carers worried about what neighbours would think stop your kid playing ipad games without headphones on the train by all means you have my tearful thanks but hanging out outside they have more right to be there than i do i can only hope theres no overlap between the neighbours generating this parental apprehension and people who complain that kids spend all their time on screens but i have my suspicions how did this climate of anxiety and intolerance emerge im not a playful person personally too stiff for physical play put a ball in my hand and ill quietly wait for an opportunity to put it down and too selfconscious for silliness or pretending when my sons were small play with me would degenerate into tidying the animals taxonomised and the lego sorted by size and colour board games make me aggressive card games confuse me and i dont like noise or boisterousness im basically a joyless soul is what im saying but even i know play is precious it facilitates independence confidence and sociability adventurous play is correlated with better mental health but it doesnt need to be any of that to be vital its a portal to joy i see and hear that on the streets around me even my ancient arthritic dog feels it my husband chucked a tennis ball for him recently and just as i started to remonstrate it was cruel oscar bounced off bringing it back expectantly more animated than i had seen him in months we threw it again he did it again it didnt last but it was heartbreakingly lovely to see him momentarily puppyish so much of childhood looks unfun now that was the conclusion of

i knew our holiday was off to a bad start when it refused to start at all our flight to lanzarote had already been delayed an hour before wed boarded bringing us perilously close to the babys midday nap could be worse we thought if she sleeps on the plane we could get two hours sleep out of this threehour flight after an hour on the runway we were still being informed that takeoff was minutes away this would be the same entirely stationary minutes wed been chasing for the previous secondly instead of her usual twohour nap our baby decided on one of those express sleeps the kind that parents share tales of round campfires the kind that leave your sweet little cherub as wide awake as a soldier roused by gunfire happily screaming with the plane still minutes from starting its threehour journey things surely couldnt get much worse with a furiously crying baby and an increasingly bored young boy on my hands not to mention a wife who was thinking many unkind things about my adult capabilities i decided i should get some more things to distract them by this i mean my kids there is little on gods green earth that can distract my wife from her husbands human failings in reaching for the overhead locker i received a stern and i think needlessly personalised message from the steward telling all passengers to sit down and belt up i apologised uselessly and out loud to no one and sank back into my seat redfaced and sullen my wife was now looking out the window hoping our fellow passengers would regard my facial similarity to her two children as mere coincidence things surely could not get much worse well guess what wed been airborne for an hour when i withdrew my daughters water bottle from my illegally requisitioned bag wearily i flipped its cap and wondered truly wondered at the absurd geyser of water that leapt from it in something like a dream state i marvelled as a solid column of liquid spurted ft into the air hitting the dimmer switches and aircon panels above before cascading down on me and the woman in front who reacted with an entirely appropriate jesus christ by the time shed said this water was still coming out of the bottle as the wonders of cabin pressure proved faster than my own failing mind leaving me and my front neighbour soaked and confused and me again apologising profusely and uselessly dabbing her chair with wet wipes not excellent for water absorption i can confirm with the majority of a fourhour flight still left to go yes fourhour flight in our haste ok my haste id seen that the arrival time was four hours after departure but had helpfully decided that this was due to time difference i had not realised that lanzarote despite being a spanish territory has the same time zone as the uk so the threehour flight wed booked and arranged ourselves with full knowledge of all its details was not three hours long but four and would be undertaken soaking wet ashamed and wreathed in screaming children at least

the first time i encountered the school summer holidays as a parent i experienced that very real sense of something having gone quite quite wrong like when you stumble upon an eclipse and the birds stop singing or you take a hot swig of cold tea if there was a manager to complain to i would have called her within a second less the maths of the thing simply did not add up six weeks without school set against first the paltry reality of everybodys annual leave from work the equivalent ratio of water to ribena and second the temperaments of both adults and children carefully balanced to withstand only i find fairly specific conditions these conditions include but are not limited to the presence of other people of the same agegroup sleep time alone culture three meals a day two snacks dessert intimacy etc any deviation from the list any absence of an element however tiny sets off a chain of stormlike chaos this summer daily adventure has quickly become essential too so far the children have gone on a tube adventure get on the tube get off again a pizza adventure order a pizza a boat adventure failed due to queue but the power of the word is unfortunately waning you find me today a week away from the end of the holidays nippledeep in devastation and unable or unwilling to try and fix it look around and you will see a parent in a similar position to you she is smiling glassily in a playground inside she is a climber stuck on a mountain considering chewing off her own foot the dad in tesco explaining to his daughter why she cant open that yoghurt right now hes crawling through a desert in bloody rags promised a faroff lake everywhere loving parents are developing sharp little twitches in their left eyes small earthquakes have been recorded across the uk as parents working from home bounce their legs against the bottoms of desks with increasing force and frequency bonk bonk bonk suburban homes are shrinking walls close in at an imperceptible pace personally ive been spending a lot of time in the bathroom we recently put down a new floor in there my partner head of childcare taught himself how to do mosaics spending weeks cutting his hands to a kind of fleshy lace and then one day through the blood and tiles i came home to find hed laid three delicate pictures down beside the bathtub and i was too pleased even to conjure a metaphor for parenthood we knocked down a wall in the bathroom too revealing a new kind of light generous and buttery which streams now into the hallway and creates warm new patches for the cat not when the doors shut though which it is now frequently as i perch on the side of the bath or on the toilet seat or lean against the mirror and meditatively scroll through my phone until someone shouts for me for a third time it was here as my children raged through the house that i first discovered the newly public instagram of one carrie johnson having recently given birth to her third child with husband boris she appears to be using social media to position herself as a tradwife mumfluencer complete with fashion recommendations and radiant pictures of floral rural fun one photo had me particularly transfixed shes sitting in bed in an elaborate white lace nightgown gazing down at her newborn baby it was partly the white linen serenity that held my attention absent of husband as all the photos are either he has transitioned to behindthecamera instagram boyfriend or his absence from the narrative is intentional who could say and partly the comments where when she asks for boxset recommendations someone suggests the handmaids tale the aesthetic was immediately recognisable traditional femininity often appears in my various feeds and just as incel culture presented itself as a cure for modern mens problems content like this suggests that being a housewife and having lots of blonde babies might cure modern women of theirs the aesthetics of modern motherhood were evident too an image of the good life that glamorous graceful commercial balance of selflessness with selfcare it appears she is having the good kind of summer holiday there are photos of idyllic country walks beside a handwringing video of a son scribbling on a wall the frazzledness of motherhood essential to document in service of both feminism and clicks i scroll on in loving disgust as i write this having excused myself from the house to find a caf with wifi my son somehow flooded the new bathroom this morning another story it occurs to me that upon writing about the unfathomable depths of the summer holidays i am doing similar work to johnson am i mumfluencing though with fewer affiliate marketing links by writing eyerollingly about my children am i mumfluencing cynical petty and constantly shocked that my actions and choices have resulted in living outcomes is it possible to document parenting today without it reading as mumfluencing a business decision and one held in contempt sometimes for presenting motherhood as an aestheticised lifestyle choice and other times for revealing it through those links and sponsorships as awfully a job i am counting the days until school begins partly because the house will be empty again allowing me to think and partly so that i will no longer have to think about this until christmas anyway email eva at ewisemanobservercouk or

my son has been on school holiday for a month now and is keeping himself busy with numbers its his latest thing and were running with it he whispers sums in my ear separates everything he owns into sets of s and s and asks mathematical riddles of everyone he meets its compelling to watch his brain work to see his intuitive sense of numbers at play stranger though are the gaps though he can add random numbers at will and double any number up to he remains stumped by which hes convinced is luckily such missteps are easily corrected and best of all he receives every clarification with delight even euphoria there are transcendently lovely moments in parenting brief and seldom but so glorious they catch you off guard i simply didnt expect fiddly sums to provide so many like when i taught him he could do superficially massive sums like m m because the solution is the same as for only with a million at the end to watch him realise this was sublime the cartoonish eye bulge the exploding smile the knowledge revealed of a tiny crack in the cosmos a loophole so beautiful it seemed thrilling possibly even illegal he could add millions actual millions and he was walking on air some questions i cant answer to his satisfaction i guess i learned adding and subtracting offrote and have long since lost the ability to show my workings some of my calculations are hard to express since theyre workarounds i developed when my brain was as wet and plastic as his if i add to for example a big part of my process involves knowing that is less than so the resulting digit will end in a number thats one less than when i add say to ill subtract from the smaller number to get the larger number up to its nearest and add whats left i do these things instantaneously but reading back those descriptions makes them seem like the ravings of a maniac chalked on some walllength blackboard try explaining negative numbers to a fiveyearold scratch that try explaining them to anyone within seconds youll sound like a hash casualty in a teenage bedroom marvelling at the idea of imaginary numbers with practical uses i try to sound confident as i tell him that no you cannot hold apples in your hand but they do still exist somehow hes doubly confused when i tell him about infinity but its as nothing compared to my own befuddlement as i try to explain it i screw my face up like robert oppenheimer as if contemplating the bleeding edge of quantum theory and not the maths expected of a child who cant yet tie his shoes if my son detects my internal crisis hes not letting on he resumes his numerical onslaught and soon were adding millions together for what seems like hours i look at the clock and it is am with three weeks of summer holidays remaining lessons in infinity are it turns

domestic violence perpetrators are weaponising subpoenas from family court proceedings to gain access to their victims personal information including counselling notes medical details and addresses in child custody battles parties can request up to five subpoenas which are almost automatically issued by the courts the information can be given to the abuser even if it will not be used in court the federal government is considering how to protect peoples confidential information and allow the court to access relevant material when considering child custody cases as it looks to amend family law to ensure the best interests of the child are prioritised gabrielle craig of womens legal services australia wlsa said despite a rule that the material not be used outside proceedings perpetrators could generally do what they liked such as stalk a former partner craig said she had seen cases where a father with a history of perpetrating violence has filed a court application with relatively low merit and immediately has the right to issue five subpoenas without leave meaning it goes via the court but is issued without checks and balances he could automatically get access to somebodys counselling notes medical notes and that obviously includes really personal private details but also might have other details like where shes living whether she has a new partner she said within that material it might have her address so he could start stalking her at her address her place of work even where shes attending counselling its also often used to embarrass someone you might see them posting on facebook sign up for guardian australias free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup craig said these details can also be used in court say there was childhood trauma mum might function perfectly fine but theyll bring that up weaponise it use it to question their parenting craig emphasised that the subpoena issue was just one component of the changes that were needed in family law the planned amendments to the family law act also include removing the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and other measures to improve the safety of separating families people have a right to object to a subpoena but craig said this was a difficult and onerous process particularly for someone without legal representation she said the details were buried in complex and overwhelming court documents and the court could still override the objection a senate committee inquiry into the proposed changes to family law is due to report on august an initial draft of the bill included protections against some personal information being introduced as evidence but the section was withdrawn to allow the government to consider complexities raised by stakeholders during consultation craig said she was supportive of the principles in the draft legislation but said more work was needed to get the balance right to ensure subpoenas dont automatically go to the other party and to inform parties about their right to object terese edwards chief executive of single mothers australia said not only could the subpoenas be weaponised but they could add to litigation abuse keeping women in expensive court proceedings and women who post separation immediately take a huge drop in cash reserves can then be living under the poverty line and that can also be weaponised against the woman portraying them as not being able to provide for their children she said it could also deter women from seeking help she said leaving in itself is not protection she said within that context there are fears about women reaching out regarding their stress their anxiety or their mental health because that can be subpoenaed larissa waters the greens spokesperson for women said she supported the department redrafting that section of the family law act and that the greens would push to ensure the right balance was struck between protecting vulnerable people and ensuring the court had the necessary information to decide what was in the childs best interest attempting to weaponise a persons confidential records through the family court is an obvious abuse of power and privilege she said in a hearing during the senate inquiry last week waters asked the attorney generals department about the removal of the provision relating to subpoenas rebecca mills the acting assistant secretary of the family law branch said the department was working through a range of issues in consultation with stakeholders were very conscious of the need with this one to balance the different interests she said so protecting parties from the harm that can be caused by the exposure of their personal records and also ensuring that the courts and opposing parties have all the

please can you help me with finding a way to tell my daughter that her driving is dangerous she drives incredibly close to the back of the vehicle in front it is difficult to judge but it sometimes feels like we are no more than a couple of metres away while we are driving very fast we live near lots of major roads and motorways so trips will usually involve this type of road i am not a nervous driverpassenger and if it wasnt so dangerously close id possibly be able to live with it she has two young children and a husband whose driving she thinks is bad as he is so fast i do occasionally say i think she is a bit close and she tuts and pulls back but within five minutes she is right up behind them no one likes having their driving criticised and i dont want to fall out over it eleanor says the fact that you havent already done what many parents would do in your situation clung whiteknuckled to the coat hook above the door bellowing too close says a lot about you and your relationship with your daughter its thoughtful to want to broach this carefully and to be alive to the fact that nobody likes to be told what to do that said this might be one of those situations where theres no way out except to say i think x while someone else says x is false often when we have something difficult to say we look for ways to get the message across that wont require disagreement having to say i think x is so squirminducing and so difficult that we kind of hope we might stumble across a way of implanting x directly in their head without having to announce that its our view unfortunately when a habit like this is ingrained you do actually have to draw someones attention to it for it to change there are more and less critical ways to do that but theres no way out of the essential conflict youre trying to get her to think something that she currently doesnt think i think there are two options she doesnt know that she drives unusually close to other cars or she doesnt mind it might help to get precise on which it is you can start by just asking questions did they teach the rule that you should be able to fix a point that the car in front drove past like a tree or a particular dashed line on the road and count to three seconds before you pass it yourself once you have clarity about which one it is you might just have to say some of the things youve said to me and not while anyones driving i know youre a competent driver and i know its not my place to baby you but i worry that if someone stops suddenly you wont have time to react you could point out that if she ever does rearend someone shes more likely to be the one found at fault and that most people overestimate their own reaction times and also underestimate the impairments of rain fog or distraction in the car the key would be to keep stressing that you only want her to be safe and that its not about knowing best or getting to boss her around to offset that implication you could even put the conversation on the back end of an interaction that makes clear that you dont take yourself to know everything is there something you could ask her to teach you or some problem you could admit youre embarrassed to need help with im thinking that if she has an opportunity to help you and be the expert on something it might feel more like information and less like a power struggle to hear the correction on the driving youre exactly right that nobody likes to be told what to do but if you want people to know things they currently dont sometimes theres no option but kind candour ask us a

i didnt become a childfree woman i was born childfree much like everyone else then i simply stayed that way there was no need to go through a futuremother phase to know that in my home there would be no chirpy childrens laughter or tippetytap of bare toddler feet poor david then my partner he most definitely was in his futurefather phase when we met aged david blond short coweyed warm smooth kind hands dramatically affectionate a natural born father if ever i saw one but in meeting me and falling in love he found himself facing a decision of epic proportions children or me when i was i went with my parents to visit family friends one night the woman in this family karina was extremely pregnant with her second child i was mesmerised and appalled the swell the veins the movement just centimetres beneath the skin alien stuff so alien in fact that to my eyes the thing i had been told to be most natural peak wholesomeness looked well im just going to say it to my yearold self it looked freakish a physical impossibility i dont think im able to have children i remember saying upon which karina replied i dont think anyone does until the ultrasound i asked myself then do i really not think im able to have children as in physically and i realised i had missed the mark it wasnt the physicality of it it was something else it was the role me as mother what i strongly felt was motherhood is not on the cards for me able probably but not willing did i mention i was a precocious child i was not shy though and had no qualms voicing this newfound epiphany i would never have children another sparkling curio added to my rapidly growing identity and ive never stopped voicing it i am lucky with family growing up i was met with neverending interest and attention there are no naysayers in my family and i have not once been told to be sensible or any such nonsense so far so good my childfreeness has not sparked any guilttripping or worry about what the neighbours will think other people have perhaps not always been as easygoing its just a phase or who will take care of you when youre and of course the wellworn favourite you will change your mind when you get older this from relatives friends acquaintances and yes strangers too a chorus so recurrent i know the lyrics by heart i can sing its harmonies probably even pick it out on the piano if asked i dont mind much its not malicious its a routine reaction one i can sympathise with and understand it doesnt hurt my feelings one bit but scratch the surface of this statement a little and underneath i wonder is there a tad of the old women are so emotional and hysterical and irrational they cant be trusted to know their own mind consensus yes i think there might be will i change my mind not impossible but unlikely and that brings us back to poor david he has been dripfed this piece of information about me since the very beginning it was not a shocking conversation we had to put our relationship through before sitting down to write this i asked him when i first told you aged wideeyed and radical and hair cut like a boy did you think it was a phase did you think id change my mind when i got older he says he doesnt remember it being quite undramatic and all but that yes he probably did think it we were so young after all we barely knew who we were i do remember one of those early conversations we had moved from stockholm to a prototypical swedish small town one car factory two wine and spirits shops or so hairdressers population a slight goodhumoured accent david was working in a large clean supermarket supporting me while at uni one day he cycled home his nose and cheeks rosy like always from stocking the freezer section all day but still i could see he was flustered while changing out of his fleece uniform he told me jimmys girlfriend is pregnant jimmy being his closest coworker the other freezerstocker theyre buying a house jenny hes there it was davids free spirit his need for stability security comfort never successfully subduing his want for the big adventure david the escapader experiencer of romps a bit of the nomad in him seeing how the news about jimmy made him doggedly protective of our geographical freedom was a relief and a joy i got chills i kissed him hard there were no smalltown chainhouse savings accounts in davids budget and soon thereafter we emigrated to london but back then in the small town he still took for granted he would be a father one day it was the normal thing to do and i remember a certain look he used to get seeing a sevenyearold in a flamboyant dress on her way to a birthday party and i figured if it wasnt for me he would delightedly buy flamboyant clothing for a future daughter hold her tiny sticky hand with his warm smooth kind one patiently endure the tinnitusy screams from a squadron of berserk children huddled with the other parents before safely bringing her home her new dress sullied and grassstained does picturing this scenario cause me guilt yes i am being dramatic david would make an excellent father yes but it doesnt mean he wants to and now it has been years since i last saw that specific look in his eyes david has gone from a content childfree person to an extremely happy one as he is wont to tell me after every dinner party with children present thank god and can you imagine if that sort of thing since i am the one inciting this lifestyle i do check in every six months or so are you sure there is still time and his conviction much like a fontanelle if youll allow the topicspecific analogy at first wobbly and pliant has calcified to seemingly bonehard bonehard or not whenever he suggests tying his tubes i do ask him to hold off i might not have many childbearing years left but his sperm could stay in mint condition for decades yet what if i die it could happen he should have the option anyhow there are other ways to contracept for the record i do not dislike children and the fact that i have to clarify this is a little strange to me i mean i wouldnt clarify being fine with japan as a country if not feeling like a trip to tokyo this year but here we are im clarifying a lesson well learned im not overly interested in children as a group i admit that specific ones i often find utterly fascinating even adorable but in general i do prefer adult company dont ask me why ive gathered that the stereotype of a childfree woman is a cutthroat careerist frigid and selfish and narcissistic even more than most ok i might be somewhat of a narcissist as my novelist and influencer job titles will imply but i am the opposite of a frigid cutthroat im a sweetheart not tough at all a surplus empathy vegan who cant watch cancer films or read toni morrison without it shattering her little eggshell heart show me a cat any cat and ill melt completely there are brands of caring other than maternal so please dont worry i am not here to convert anyone i have no stakes here i am not representing other childfree women we are not a group and even though motherhood and childfreeness are both highly politicised topics especially in countries where womens reproductive rights have either never existed or been recently revoked for me personally there is no morality involved i am not proud to be childfree but more importantly and if youre skimming this article this is where i would invite your eyes to pause though not proud neither am i ashamed my only reason for not having kids is that i simply do not want to flippant perhaps but not shameful it might be a tad abnormal probably unrelatable to most but that does not embarrass me there is no sense of lack i do not wonder what if i do not feel unnatural or less of a woman then what about david i know my own views but can a person ever truly know what someone else is feeling is there a sense of lack in him deeply hidden under layers of contentment i dont think there is but i will never know for certain what i will do though is take his word for it trust that he can make his own decision guard his own happiness respect him enough to not treat him like a hysterical irrational woman who doesnt know her own mind by telling him you know you might change your mind when you get older jenny mustard is the author of okay days sceptre hardback buy it for at guardianbookshopcom,2023-08,didnt become

my daughter is still not walking weve tried everything which in practice basically amounts to standing her up against the fridge and calling on her to approach us weve tried to incentivise her with treats and shiny things even the promise of her most coveted object the remote control for the tv in our sitting room i spice things up even further by clearly displaying that its batteries are still in place do not ask me why my monthold baby who cannot yet walk speak or reliably find her own mouth at meal times has such intuitive knowledge of powered electrics but suffice it to say she not only reserves preference for the one working remote control we own discounting the other five or six scattered around but knows that when i take the batteries out it is useless to her even this glinting bauble cannot induce her to amble forth in perhaps my most abject display of desperation i pulled the emergency cord about two months ago i wrote a column about her walking troubles it was not my hope that she would herself be shamed by such coverage you understand but i have often observed something which i call the column problem paradox put simply i have an eerily consistent record of writing about problems or phenomena which have entirely disappeared by the time they are published a week later ailments that come and go passions that burn brightly and fade away my sons insistence on saying only the word deeto had evaporated entirely by the time the world read about it his enthusiasm too for throwing the bin in the bath rang only the dimmest gong when readers referenced it to me on publication day obviously this is perfectly explicable kids do weird things for short spans and a week later youre dealing with some other thing over time however ive given into magical thinking raising this banal correlation to something like clairvoyance on my part that is until i tried to use my journalistic powers to make my daughter walk and the attempt fell as flat as her own small bum on the tiles of our kitchen floor her three other baby cousins have all started walking since we last discussed this and its getting to the point where id be mildly embarrassed to share the video of her taking her first steps as when a skincare brand announces theyre no longer partnering with an arms dealer and you wonder why that ever happened in the first place i fear showing footage of my daughter taking her first steps when shes old enough to legally drive a forklift might raise more questions than it answers we return to the fridge i have the remote in my hand she stares and laughs and crawls vigorously toward me not that i should worry there is magic in my fingertips and two columns ought to do it shell be walking by the time you read this i can feel it did ye hear mammy died

i assume eleanor talbot possesses a crystal ball considering her letter supporting the twochild cap on benefits august most parents do consider whether or not they can afford children before having them however life happens you may become disabled your partner may die you may lose your job no parent can predict these things upon conception and we should have a system to support all families who fall on hard times regardless of their size also children are not responsible for the choices of their parents and they shouldnt be made to suffer moralising about whos responsible for their upkeep does nothing to change the fact that once a child is born they have needs that have to be met a childhood of grinding poverty should not be the punishment for families who have more children this is the punishment for over a million children forced into poverty or forced deeper into it simply for having more than one sibling no child deserves poverty and destitution all deserve a childhood free of that burden and we should be outraged that theyre not tony blair promised to end child poverty by it is possible to end it now if we have the political will kathleen foster bordon hampshire while eleanor talbot makes some valid points regarding responsibilities as parents for our children she ignores several realities not all women even in the uk have freedom of choice as to whether they

the complexities of caring for someone elses child permanently as a kinship carer should not be underestimated as your editorial highlights august parents have relied on kinship care for centuries it enables children to grow up within their family maintaining key relationships and links to communities however changing family dynamics are not easy to navigate children placed with kinship carers by a local authority are likely to have experienced loss trauma and abuse and need sensitive and attuned reparative care support for kinship carers including financial help should be available regardless of the legal status of the kinship arrangement as a membership organisation corambaaf hears from local authorities about the many challenges they face in assessing and supporting kinship carers in the current legal and policy context the governments national kinship strategy is welcome and will increase the focus on kinship care we hope that this will lead to a legal definition of kinship care and commitment to support an allowance for all kinship carers is vital but support needs to be farreaching and responsive and meet the needs of both the children and their carers clare seth kinship consultant corambaaf i was very interested to read your editorial on the recent report on kinship care in england kinship care in scotland has provided stable caring placements for many children who could not be cared for by their birth parents and has allowed them to remain within their wider family plans to financially support more kinship carers in england are welcome but financial help is only one element many kinship carers are providing loving homes for children and young people who have experienced trauma abuse and loss as a result they need support not only from skilled social workers on a longterm basis but also from schools and therapeutic and mental health services if these children are to recover rebuild positive attachments and thrive this is not always happening in

the morning after the birth of our fourth daughter my husband bumped into a neighbour in our street and announced the news her response surprised him are you very disappointed she asked gary headed indoors and reported the news to me whereupon we cackled with laughter and had another glass of champagne the previous morning id finished reading little women with one of my older daughters id already had an excited inkling i was about to become marmee a mother of four girls and now id been proved right we were thrilled to have another daughter to add to our brood but it quickly became apparent that the world like our neighbour had other ideas and that view seems to be backed up by research published last week which found that the birth of a third daughter in a family with no boys was a downer on parental wellbeing especially the mothers psychological wellbeing the findings published in the journal of behavioural and experimental economics suggest that it takes the mother a whole decade to entirely recover their sense of wellbeing after the arrival of a third girl the research doesnt extend to the arrival of a fourth daughter but its logical conclusion is that a mother like me is in for an even rougher ride none of this corresponds to how i felt about having a fourth daughter pregnant with my first i remember thinking id probably be having a boy which i put down to inbuilt patriarchal bias boys come first in the sexist world that surrounds us the baby was rosie second time around my expectation was that id have a boy this time which was perhaps based on the law of probability the new arrival was elinor third time around i was convinced i was having a boy but the person who emerged was miranda and by the time i got to catriona i was absolutely certain id be having another girl and i was what i dont remember though was any sense of preference in all this but definitely others assumed id had a preference and their assumptions were eerily similar to the trends revealed in this study our neighbour who thought wed be disappointed was the first of many to assume wed been hoping for a boy and indeed wed already had plenty of similar comments after the birth of our third daughter one friend who had a boy after four girls encouraged us to keep trying even the nigerian friend who told me that youd be the luckiest mother in the village where i was born seemed to be trying to cheer me up assuming that id be wishing my fourth childs sex was different i found it all slightly mystifying because what felt very real to me was that gender is only one aspect of what makes your child interesting and it certainly isnt the most crucial element the authors of this new study write of the assumption that parents with two children of the same sex want a third child of the opposite sex and say it may be the case that some parents want a third child of the same sex how about parents like me and my husband who simply wanted another child i resisted any opportunity to find out whether i was having a girl or a boy on the grounds that this information would tell me only one small thing about the individual person i was going to shortly meet and with that would come expectations and assumptions and biases that i could perhaps swerve if i waited to see what sort of personality id given birth to rather than what sex twentyone years on from the birth of my last child the fact that theyre all girls doesnt give much clue as to who they all are one is a keen football fan and has been since she was a small child two earn as much or more as their male partners in the partnerships of at least two of them i wouldnt be surprised if the partners become the main early carers of any children they might go on to have i cant help wondering and in fact hoping that this new research has already been overtaken by a more enlightened approach it uses data from two studies one based on people born in the other based on people born in could it be simply that the trends the researchers have discovered are already outdated and that for a contemporary cohort of parents the arrival of a third girl might not be associated with what the academics in this paper describe as a negative hit id be interested down the line to read the views on this of participants in the millennium cohort study which focuses on people born around maybe they will have a different take on it its hard to understand what a piece of research such as this has to offer beyond fancy that and a flurry of headlines in a society thats increasingly aware of how blurred the boundaries can be between male and female and is far less limited by biology all very positive directions in my view research like this feels a bit out of its time so too does the assertion that in our results it seems that mothers do not want to have too many children of the same sex as them it is possible this reflects not just an issue of children but one of household composition with the mother not wanting too many females in the household the inference is jealousy that a mother is somehow programmed to become envious of or undermined by her daughters thats not a feeling ive ever experienced it seems to me to belong to a different place and time and happily not the space in which ive been raising my children joanna moorhead is a guardian and observer journalist do you have an

ive done my bit by having six children so now you do yours jacob reesmogg demanded of gb news viewers recently not so long ago politicians were panicking about overpopulation now many worry that there are or will be too few people in the world there is one critical outcome that liberal individualism has completely failed to deliver and that is babies one of the rising stars of the tory party mp miriam cates told the national conservatism conference in may the resurgence of such natalism has been provoked by falling birthrates across the globe in according to a study in the lancet women were having an average of children in their lifetime by that had fallen to and is predicted to fall below by england and wales are almost at that figure now the birthrate having dropped from in to in marking in cates view a population collapse in response many countries are actively pursuing policies to increase the numbers of children born though the efficacy of such programmes is debatable in japan and south korea decades of policymaking have done little to stem the downward trend in europe the charge towards more family friendly policies has been led by rightwing populist politicians notably in hungary poland and italy these programmes have won widespread acclaim from conservatives elsewhere there is however a paradox in rightwing natalism studies have shown that the biggest and longestlasting impact comes from expanding goodquality properly funded childcare and increasing paid parental leave while tax reforms and cash transfers have at best small and temporary effects yet conservative natalism often points in a different direction in britain a pernicious policy of recent years has been the two child cap on benefit recipients which punishes people for having too many children and drives larger families into poverty one might have thought that selfproclaimed natalists would oppose policies that penalise people for having larger families not so cates and reesmogg both support the cap cates also objects to government plans to expand free childcare arguing that instead there should be tax reform to persuade mothers to stay at home rightwing natalists may be desperate for people to have more babies but only the right kinds of people and within the right family structure theirs is a policy programme linked to fears about immigration and demographic change on the one hand and the breakdown of traditional gender roles on the other both fears have been exploited by western conservatives favourite natalist hungarys viktor orbn in his state of the nation address orbn announced a series of natalist measures including the waiving of income tax for women raising at least four children dismissing the idea that the answer to fewer children born in europe is immigration he insisted that we need hungarian children migration for us is surrender if in the future europe is to be populated by people other than europeans orbn told a demography summit in budapest later that year then we will effectively be consenting to population replacement to a process in which the european population is replaced it was a deliberate nod to the great replacement theory a farright belief that the elites are replacing indigenous europeans with immigrants immigration he insisted at the next demography summit is an identity issue for him only white christians make acceptable migrants others especially muslims are invaders the linking of baby production with the protection of racial identity and western civilisation has a long history at the end of the th century the future us president theodore roosevelt claimed that competition between the races reduced itself to the warfare of the cradle this has become a key motif within contemporary farright circles the cradle adriano scianca a leading member of the neofascist casapound organisation argues is the most powerful weapon when the baby cots are empty civilisation dies it is not just the far right that links civilisation to the cradle as orbn has become a lodestar for mainstream conservatives so they have been drawn not just to his natalist policies but also to his demographic vision of the west they increasingly worry about white decline and about europeans being driven out of their homeland and endorse the great replacement theory many yoke fears about the falling birthrate to a dread that europe will lose its racial identity fertility in africa and the middle east is skyhigh bemoaned the novelist lionel shriver in a polemic against the age of the antinatalists without drastic change she continued european peoples and their diaspora will dwindle if hostility to immigration is one pole of rightwing natalism the other is the maintenance of traditional gender roles the desire for more women to be stayathome mothers the expansion of childcare cates argues devalues the crucial role of motherhood for cates you cannot be socially liberal and economically conservative in hungary and poland natalist policies go handinhand with restrictive policies on abortion and contraception they also correspond to more hostile views of the gay community the western left attack the traditional family model orbn insists by relativising the concept of the family and promoting the idea that gay couples are equally capable of ensuring a flourishing family life that orbn claims is lgbtq propaganda italy too under giorgia meloni has joined in the legal assault on the gay community in the name of protecting traditional families there are good reasons for expanding affordable childcare and funding proper parental leave not because this might increase the fertility rate but because such policies are good for women for children and for society there are good reasons for thinking more concretely about the consequences of falling birthrates and the policies needed to respond to it and to acknowledge too that immigration cannot be the sole answer but is likely to be part of it there are though no good reasons for using concern about birthrates to exacerbate hostility to immigration to project divisive notions of identity and to restrict the rights of women and gay people that is to enclose iniquity in a family friendly wrapping kenan malik is an observer columnist do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article if you would like to submit a

its my first experience of school holidays as a parent and im realising for the first time how hard it is i should have known that this was going to happen time being linear and all that but i dont think id ever realised just how much time a summer break actually lasts weve signed my son up for one of those local summer workshop things that mostly exist to enable working parents to stay employed but cost so much that you basically end up working for free for its duration this one has a musical element for which he and his classmates will rehearse maybe from annie to my mind the finest song in which an orphaned child theorises on the social class of their biological parents the staff are excellent and seem invested in creating a fullspectrum experience for my son since he comes home each day having made a rice crispy cake muffin or gingerbread man ive no idea what my dad did to keep us entertained during the summer when we were kids northern irish schools take july and august off and in the republic of ireland secondary schoolers get june off too ive been told this elongated holiday dates from the days when teens were expected to suspend their studies to help with summertime farm work but ive never had this urban rural myth confirmed my dad didnt set us to ploughing or enlist the help of a vaguely musical theatrethemed summer club to fill this void i think he might have just thrown us a double pack of sliced ham and driven off to work we grew up surrounded by countryside so it would be nice to tell you that i spent my days gambolling through fields picking floral bunches perhaps conveying an easel to a pasture for some live watercolours i did none of these things instead my days began by watching the big breakfast at am and my eyes remained fixed on the tv until neighbours came on around lunchtime thereafter we would raid my dads strong collection of films taped off the telly looking for those wed not yet seen often these were two to a tape and after a strange afternoon viewing of say robocop backtoback with a womans heart live from rte my little brother and i would play football up against the garage until we broke something this was inevitably seconds before my dads car pulled in from work so he could shout at us and maybe threaten to apportion us less ham for the following day when i pick my son up he seems to have had a lovely time but i lament that he will never experience the unsupervised joys of my childhood hes a city boy and as much as i envy his access to public transport and interactions with people to whom hes unrelated hell never know the true horror of being forced to make your own fun in the pure proving fire of rural boredom poor thing i think hell have to content himself with show tunes and gingerbread men did ye

englands childcare sector risks becoming a playground for private equity experts have said as exclusive analysis from the guardian reveals investment funds have more than doubled their stake in the sector in just four years the findings come as the treasury prepares to spend an extra bn a year of taxpayers money funding nursery places the research prompted warnings that the increasing involvement of private equity in the sector could leave providers more vulnerable to closure and do nothing to address the shortage of places in deprived areas where parents cannot afford to pay as much for childcare the guardians detailed analysis of ofstedregistered nurseries reveals that in at least were fully or partially controlled by investment companies including private equity and venture capital firms of all nursery places up from in investment funds ultimately own nearly childcare places in england almost double the total the rapid growth means thousands of nurseries could be vulnerable to collapse according to unions and experts who say that the chaotic neardemise of thames water and the highprofile failures of private equitybacked firms in adult social care should act as canaries in the coalmine a ucl report last year warned that nurseries were being snapped up by profitfocused companies that were heavily indebted with risky financial operating models that could threaten the provision of nursery places the research found market dynamics can lead to insufficient coverage in poorer less profitable areas these potential risks were highlighted in the adult social care sector with the highprofile collapse of southern cross in and of four seasons health care which is operated by administrators after a previous owner the private equity firm terra firma racked up huge debts mike short the head of education at unison said many parents relied on privately owned nurseries for their childcare that needed to make money to survive he said if these companies dont make money they go under but once private equity firms become involved the pursuit of profit is ruthless and on a whole new level the structure of equityfunded nurseries is so complex often with hundreds of subsidiary companies created that its almost impossible to fathom where the cash is going the trades union congress tuc said the earlyyears sector needed sustainable and longterm investment not flybynight merchants looking to make a quick buck joeli brearley chief executive of the campaign group pregnant then screwed called on the government to intervene and put measures in place to guard against serious profiteering adding that private equity should have no place in the education and care of our children she said placing early learning and care in the hands of private equity is to play russian roulette with our children and the economy childcare mustnt be another playground for private equity the risks are too great dr antonia simon a leading expert in childcare sector financing at university college london ucl also said providers that are heavily reliant on private equity funding were more likely to have high debt low cash reserves and be at significantly greater risk of collapse she said if these nurseries collapse as we have seen in the adult social care sector children and families will miss out on vital and valuable early years care and many nursery staff could lose their jobs the government must make urgent reforms to make the early years sector more transparent and accountable private equity and venture capital firms have made at least investments including acquisitions mergers and buyouts in the uk early years and childcare sector in the last decade with of those taking place in separate guardian analysis of the venture capital database pitchbook reveals the data analysis does not suggest lesser quality in such facilities indeed some providers cited high quality ratings in their response to comments from the guardian responding to the guardians research a spokesperson for the british private equity and venture capital association said the inferences being made here about the role of private equity dont reflect the real world the average private equity investment is well over five years compared with five months on the public markets this longterm commitment from private equity investors is essential in helping companies grow in a responsible way the latest annual accounts of eagle midco the parent company of busy bees shows that the companys longterm debts were more than seven times higher than its pretax earnings according to their latest accounts the company disputed this ratio saying that this figure included future commitments to pay rent the biggest nursery chain in england busy bees nursery group is owned by the ontario teachers pension plan ottp a spokesperson for busy bees said it had long been recognised as a leader in childcare that of its nurseries were assessed by ofsted ratings as good or outstanding and that the scale and quality of our services people and centres have further improved through considerable investment by otpp over the past decade they said it invested proportionally more in its existing facilities and in opening greenfield facilities than comparable nursery chains including investment of close to m in the past two years the nurseries backed by investment companies include some of the biggest groups in england such as kids planet which was bought by the private equity firm fremman capital at the end of the provider which was first backed by the private equity firm bgf has gone on a buying spree of rival nurseries in recent years quadrupling the number of its childcare places between and from almost to more than the dutch private equity firm waterland acquired the partou group in may the largest childcare provider in the netherlands partou recently moved into the english market acquiring the nursery groups all about children and just childcare among other providers the londonbased oakley capital bought and rebranded bright stars nursery in one of the fastestgrowing childcare groups in response to the guardian a spokesperson for partou said recent reports commissioned by the dutch government showed little difference in quality between social and commercial childcare organisations in the netherlands they also said the current generation of private equity funds focused on quality to improve childcare organisations and professionalise the sector and that the fears of prioritising financial returns over public interest were unfounded they added that partou and its holding companies were part of an environmental social and governance fund established by waterland that had a focus on sustainability and responsible investing responding to the guardians findings bridget phillipson suggested that a labour government could tighten rules around the ownership of childcare settings the shadow education secretary said as part of the reformed modern childcare system labour will create with better support for families we will introduce stronger regulation of providers financial sustainability to ensure sustainability of the sector a department for education spokesperson said we will continue to closely monitor the sufficiency of childcare places as we roll out our single biggest investment in childcare in england

mom repeated my daughters voice on my phone ive messed up my heart sank and i started trembling i heard a man instructing her to lie down and put her head back my yearold daughter briana was at a skiing competition with my husband two hours away and i instantly thought shed been badly hurt i was in my car picking up her sister aubrey who is from dance class in arizona over the phone i heard briana bawling and shouting help me help me my blood ran ice cold and my legs turned to jelly as the man on the phone began explaining that he had my daughter and if i told anyone he would pump her stomach full of drugs drop her in mexico and i would never see her again i sprinted into the lobby of the building where aubrey was having her dance class putting the phone on mute i wailed for help from the other parents by this point the man was shouting threats down the phone a couple of mothers started calling coming out of class to hear what the fuss was about aubrey was thrown into a panic too i pleaded with her to try to contact the rest of the family but she was frozen in terror ill never forget her face as she tried to process that someone had taken her sister you need to pay m if you want to see her again the man threatened i didnt have that kind of money so agreed to give him he told me he would come and pick me up in a white van and put a bag over my head so i couldnt see where we were going i was told that if i didnt bring the money in cash id be driven to mexico and left there dead along with my daughter no part of me questioned whether this was actually real every instinct within me was screaming out to do anything to save my babys life one of the mothers who had been calling then burst into view her voice seeming slow and distorted in my brain as i heard the words its ai its an ai scam the police had been seeing a rise in cases recently with similar descriptions but i just couldnt accept it i kept thinking my baby is out there and someone needs to save her now it was my daughters voice i would never have mistaken that another mother then said she had managed to reach my husband who had found briana she was skiing and safe and hadnt got a clue what anyone was talking about the man on the phone was still arguing muting his call i demanded to speak to my husband and daughter on the other line i needed to hear their voices myself briana told me she had no clue what i was talking about and was safe with her dad at the ski resort my brain felt like fuzz i was relieved to hear her voice but still reeling i unmuted the other line where the man was still telling me all the things hed do to us if we didnt comply i started calling him out calling him a scammer but he kept going saying he had her i hung up on him afterwards i was devastated to hear that the police only considered this a prank call and wouldnt investigate it because no one had been hurt and no money had been taken they said it was probably an ai scam as there had been many reports of them recently they assumed brianas voice would have been aigenerated and the mans would have been real when i heard that i broke down traumatised i couldnt get over how real her voice sounded i was so sure they had been her cries aubrey and i drove up to join the rest of the family the next day i squeezed briana tight so grateful that we were all ok and back together again its really impacted aubrey a guy her age tried to give her his number and she ran over to me worrying he was trying to kidnap her its heartbreaking its said that all you need is three seconds of audio to replicate a persons voice though all of brianas social media accounts are private there are some videos of her being interviewed for sports and for school but nothing of her crying out im nervous about how new technology like ai can be used to harm children having seen firsthand how scary these things can be i want to do everything i can to protect my family and others from anything like this

estimates of the number of children living in some form of kinship care in the uk vary as does the definition but the figure could be as high as around twice the number that are looked after by local authorities in a minority of cases there is overlap with relatives becoming foster carers but despite their large number these households have a lower profile in policy terms than more formal care arrangements that might be changing as the local authority care system has become more dysfunctional due to funding cuts increasing numbers of unaccompanied children arriving in the uk and the damaging effects of marketisation it is being suggested that kinship carers could offer a solution or at least part of one josh macalister is one highprofile advocate for this view appointed by the government to carry out an independent review of childrens social care in england and wales he produced a report that recommended strengthened support for kinship carers mr macalister cited evidence of better employment and health outcomes for children cared for by relatives and a stronger likelihood of sibling relationships being maintained the government has responded positively announcing a

is a role for policymakers in setting the conditions in which such decisions are made in scotland around of lookedafter children are formally placed with kinship carers which is significantly more than in england and wales in some european countries the proportion is over half arrangements range from guardianship orders made by courts to informal agreements the definition being consulted on by ministers includes care offered by friends as well as relatives and the difficulty for the government is how to create a framework that benefits everyone tensions include where a relative is forced to make a choice between accepting parental responsibility for a child and becoming a foster carer thereby gaining an entitlement to financial and other forms of support a new kinship carers allowance as recommended by mr macalister looks like a way out of this dilemma and should be tested data showing that more than threequarters of kinship carers live in deprived areas is all the more reason to act kinship carers should gain an entitlement to paid leave from work like adopters and access to support networks backed by local authorities it makes sense to require ofsted to consider kinship care when inspecting councils more research is also needed but it would be a mistake to see the increased use of family placements as any kind of quick fix to the many problems with the childrens social care system if a childs best interests in most cases are served by being kept close to existing networks friends schools places they are familiar with this must be possible within the formal care

i am a staff member at the thomas coram nursery school and centre coram charity accused of throttling by stealth nursery it helped create july my colleagues and i are deeply invested in the campaign to try to save the nursery school and i am so furious with the defence that coram has given for its actions that i felt i had to write i have worked at the nursery for nine years four when it first opened and then again for the last five as part of the senior leadership team it is a unique and wonderful place that has served thousands of children in need coram has argued that it needs to raise our rent to unaffordable levels of hundreds of thousands of pounds and reduce classroom space on the grounds that it is a charity that is obliged to maximise income but the fact that it is a charity is the point it has a charitable object the provision maintenance and conduct of day nurseries nursery schools open spaces and other establishments and facilities for and in connection with the education and welfare of children in need coram set up the nursery in partnership with camden to fulfil its own objectives perhaps it is planning to change that objective to something like to make as much money as possible by building offices which seems to better reflect its current position but i wonder how popular that would be with potential donors coram seems to have forgotten that it was entrusted with its site in kings cross to carry out the work of providing service specifically nursery provision for vulnerable children not to exploit it as a piece of prime real estate many of the nursery staff have been horrified by corams actions because they thought of themselves as part of coram working together with the same objective we only hope that the trustees rethink and that we can

tens of thousands of children in england and wales have been left in limbo by delays in the family court that have meant many waiting over a year for their future to be resolved the law society said the system was in crisis after data showed that children removed from their parents were having to wait an average of weeks to get a final decision on where they would live in a quarter of areas the wait in family proceedings in public law cases was double the recommended government target of weeks with the longest delays in east london and norwich both of which had waiting times of weeks in the first three months of this year lubna shuja president of the law society said what is often missed in the debate around the unacceptable backlogs in our family courts is the impact on children they are suffering the very real consequences of months and sometimes years of uncertainty about their future preventing them from having the stability they need to thrive only one area worcester hit the week target in the first quarter of the year according to the statistics published by the children and family court advisory and support service cafcass west london and wolverhamptontelford were the next worst after east london and norwich with each recording a wait of weeks cafcass said it had open childrens cases at the end of may affecting individual children the law society which represents solicitors in england and wales said children involved in private family law cases waiting for decisions on living arrangements after their parents had separated also faced similar delays courts statistics showed that there are more than children caught up in private family law proceedings while the average case duration last year was weeks cris mccurley a member of the law societys access to justice committee said the entire family courts system is creaking after years of austerity cuts and neglect as a practitioner it is heartbreaking to have to deal with the consequences of this and i worry about the effect on children some of whom have not seen their primary carer parent for more than three years there needs to be investment in the system now the society is calling on the government to restore early legal advice in family law cases to help parents better understand their rights and their options for resolving issues involving children shuja said the government is focused on introducing mandatory mediation in family cases as the way to solve the backlogs in the courts but mediation is not always appropriate early legal advice means separating couples can get the guidance they need to identify the solution that works for them solicitors can assist in negotiating settlements or refer them to mediation where appropriate a ministry of justice spokesperson said we have been taking decisive action to improve waiting times in the family courts with over more private law cases reaching conclusion in than in and are investing m in our landmark mediation scheme to prevent disputing parents from needing to go to court in the first place while also investing millions in early legal support for those who do need to see a judge,2023-08,ten thousand child

theres a level of expectation that the world fits around the kids the kids dont fit around the world says stephen boydie boyd he is the ownermanager of the alma a pub in crystal palace south london that does not admit children under its a summer afternoon and most of the punters appear to be young adults and parents in their s plus some teenagers with gen x parents boyds observation strikes me as true at a cultural level even deeper than the pub the problem with kids isnt the kids its the parents or rather its what some parents become when their kids are under gripped by a sense that the burden of keeping them contented is astronomically heavy and should be shared by all martin bridge the owner of the whippet inn a boutique childfree restaurant in york says being in the industry odd years and also out shopping out in public places how parents view the responsibility of their children and how that has changed is quite mindblowing it feels as though the kids are now the responsibility of everybody all the time boyd continues none of the demands were particularly outrageous but the sheer volume apple juice with water in it babyccinos heat this up but not too much remove the mushrooms the onions the salt the pepper then there was the glaring at people who swear vape or give any other indication that they are an adult in a pub for me the peerless example of parental entitlement occurred years ago in an online comment underneath a restaurant review by the food critic marina oloughlin the busier it got the more the staff seemed to get annoyed with my child being there refusing to keep an eye on him for only two minutes while we went outside for a cigarette the aggrieved mother wrote my son was getting agitated crying etc so i began to breastfeed him the manageress came back with our brandies and just looked at me disgusted this basically turned into a standup argument between me and this woman who is obviously jealous for some reason the food is nice but the misogyny is another story altogether when it comes to questions of children in society there is no consensus about what parents can or should expect from others we could probably all agree that landlords cannot ban children in rental agreements yet a bbc investigation this month found that almost a quarter of ads on openrent did so explicitly its almost certainly a breach of the equality act but tenants may never know why their application has been refused conversely we could probably all agree that its not a waiters job to look after your baby while you go for a fag between these two points is a huge spectrum wherever parents fall on it they will most likely defend their position to the hilt the whippet has been kidfree since it opened years ago bridge remembers the initial response we got so many negative reviews it was unreal people screaming and shouting at us in the restaurant it was quite daunting certainly for some of the staff new parents were the worst he got the feeling it wasnt really about the restaurant it had become an emblem to these parents of how their lives had changed how their freedom and agency had been curtailed i am paraphrasing because he picks his words so carefully new parents are scary when i was a kid it was routine to bar children from pubs i remember my dad walking my sister and me what felt like miles it was probably three through heavy snow to a pub then having to sit outside with a lemonade and a packet of saltandvinegar crisps for hours i thought maybe it was just my dad but bridge has exactly the same memory down to the crisp flavour we used to get left in the car with the window down and a packet of saltandvinegar crisps your parents would look at you through the window to check you were all right that wasnt entirely parental negligence it was against the law to let unders into pubs in england and wales until when that changed in the teeth of significant moral opposition it was pushed through not as a parental rights issue but with a vibe of wouldnt it be nicer if we were more like mainland europe by the st century however the vogue had flipped to the extent that it was unusual for a pub not to have a childrens menu by when my kids were three and one pubs were experimenting with playrooms to get the smalls out of the main drag there would be one cranky parent from every group in a room full of duplo and lidless felt tips supervising mayhem with the onset of an unjust hangover recently though some parts of the world have had enough south korea has nokid zones which are scattered throughout seoul and have spread to tourist areas such as busan and jeju island these are thought to have taken off after an incident when a mother complained that her child had been scalded by a waitress carrying hot soup the subsequent outrage prompted the restaurant to release cctv footage which showed the kid behaving like a hellion in a court determined that the child had been partly responsible here began a new battle that spiralled into campaigns pronouncements and lawmaking jeju is working on a ban on banning children the national human rights commission of korea decreed in that childrens rights should be respected and that they take priority over the freedom of owners to operate their businesses it didnt make a whole heap of difference south korea has one of the lowest birthrates in the world but the reason is foggy is it because people dont want to have babies if they cant take them to burger joints or has the relative scarcity of babies made people less tolerant of them carrying on in public emilie cole a spokesperson for the childfree fistral beach hotel in newquay says in the end you know what youre getting adults are adults all children are different did restaurants used to be better at tolerating difference or did parents used to be better at stamping it out in other countries the examples come singly a coffee house in ireland a spaghetti joint in new jersey a restaurant named ironically grandmas kitchen in germany which has banned unders we have heard of these establishments not because they are numerous but because they generate the most furious overwrought debate is this a misogynistic throwback banishing mothers to domesticity what is wrong with a society that cant cope with its own young whither the future the central question is probably held in common with all intractable arguments who is being selfish and antisocial the parents of small children who want everything bent to their needs or everyone else who doesnt want to bend we are all antisocial sometimes but very few of us are all the time it depends what kind of nights sleep weve had boyd first banned unders when he reopened the alma postcovid and couldnt see a way to enforce the ruleofsix and social distancing with kids running around his daughter later persuaded him to reduce the age limit to on the basis that year s at school didnt run around causing havoc and were generally able to sit still and finish their lunch the biggest change is that our average spend has nearly doubled he says the atmosphere is more relaxing nobody is wedged in behind a buggy people stay longer they have cheese another bottle of wine perhaps they go up the wine menu parents are never going up the wine menu staff turnover is way down because its a less hectic environment previously bar staff used to try to avoid the day shift edie denvir has worked at the alma for months and talks in very forgiving terms about the hordes of kids at the last place she worked i wouldnt want to generalise a lot of parents are really nice but the higher table spend obviously means better tips in the garden steven penketh is enjoying a drink with his wife emma and three teenagers molly kit and blake generally people are quite aware of what their kids are up to so im not in favour of banning children emma says they live locally and have been coming in for years but still find it a bit hostile steven says the way its the first thing the staff say when they take a booking over the phone no unders i feel like saying what do you take me for one of those morons who gives birth to a child before its however he comes in anyway because i dont come to the pub to enjoy other peoples children under molly interjects with some detail about her parents they really like it in here one of the waiters knows their names two tables away lawrence and samsara are looking at the menu i ask him about the kidfree policy and affronted he says but im once weve cleared that up he says he likes it anywhere he is allowed to smoke i dont really when there are kids around i feel awkward perhaps the fiercest version of this row is played out not between parents and nonparents but between sets of parents who are either at different points on the rearing curve or have very different attitudes about what wellbehaved means and whose responsibility it is to mind the baby while you smoke when mumsnet users have this debate you can really hear how much people freight their parenting decisions with their own identity and selffashioning so the why cant we be more like italy where everyone loves babies and why shouldnt children learn to love fine dining at a young age crowd are essentially flagging their own sophistication while the no threeyearold can be expected to behave properly in a pub ive paid good money for the luxury of not hearing any screaming crowd are the voices of order and discipline and these two camps will never see eye to eye ultimately the prokids side is probably outnumbered by the legion who like children in principle but feel they have done their time at the coalface the day the alma really worried about in the first year they went childfree was mothers day it was by a country mile our busiest ever boyd says perhaps a selective child ban will pan out like the smoking ban fiercely opposed in the runup by stakeholders smokers but then when it had all shaken down everyone even smokers realised how much nicer it was without the smell of other peoples encumbrances incidentally calling the unders encumbrances is fine once they are

parents of nursery and primary schoolage children are facing more than of extra childcare costs a month a study has found as employers demand staff spend more days in the office more than half of parents said they had come under increasing pressure to increase time spent at their desks in response to a survey by the flexible childcare provider pebble the move by employers to issue new returntooffice mandates in recent months is resulting in higher childcare costs equating to an average of an additional every month according to a survey of parents employers were found on average to be asking their staff to return to their desks for an additional two days each week putting pressure on family finances amid the cost of living crisis sarah not her real name works in financial services in scotland and is struggling with the cost and logistics of childcare after her employer ordered all staff back to the office for four days a week up from the previous threeday mandate nobody is happy about it never mind working parents it doesnt make sense as the evidence shows working from home is very productive while the extra time with the family was a nobrainer she said sarah and her husband live in a rural area with no family nearby and limited childcare availability the cost of which she described as horrendous she is now looking for a job offering more home working people reckon the company is going in the direction of five days in the office and i just cant do that with the many years ahead of me with children in primary school she said two in five parents told pebble which enables ad hoc bookings at nurseries and other childcare locations they were struggling to afford additional childcare costs half of those surveyed said they expected to quit their current roles in order to find jobs offering more remote working meanwhile more than a third of parents surveyed said they had already changed jobs to avoid office time large corporates have started to call an end to the more flexible working patterns which followed the pandemic led by big tech firms including amazon google and meta and banks including citigroup and lloyds since the end of the summer lloyds has been encouraging staff back to their desks and it currently expects workers to attend for two days a week under a new flexible working policy the lender said it was offering compressed working arrangements to parents and carers with the option to squeeze a fiveday working week into four however one lloyds employee who did not want to give their name complained of a lack of flexibility i have to work tuesdays and wednesdays in the office which are not days i would have chosen due to childcare reasons and i have to work they said they claimed this was causing worry about what to do once their child starts school next year having to work in the office means i will have to pay for breakfast club and afterschool club but this still doesnt cover the time it will take for me to commute im at a loss as to what i can do some parents may have benefited from reduced childcare costs when they were required to work from home during the pandemic but many are now struggling to find adequate and affordable care according to lance beare the chief executive of pebble weve seen increases in fees due to cost of living pressures and of course some childcare settings have closed due to the increased financial pressures he said forced office rollbacks means the pressure is on for parents to secure fixed provision and to commit to higher fees consistently the impact of rising childcare costs was highlighted by the campaign group pregnant then screwed which surveyed more than parents it found that families with an annual household income under were being hit the hardest prompting a fifth of parents in such households to leave the workforce almost twothirds of parents with children under five said they or their partner had reduced their working hours as a

this july the body of yearold duvan tomas perez became entangled in meat processing machinery in mississippi according to a statement from marjac poultry the company where the boy was working perez was too young to be working there according to marjac which blamed an outside staffing company for failing to verify perezs age and identity perez was not the first worker to die at the plant in recent years and he was not the first yearold to die at work in the us this summer american legislators should be working to crack down on child labor here and abroad but instead politicians including democrats in at least states have introduced or passed bills that weaken child labor laws at a time when adult workers are demanding a fairer slice of the increasingly behemoth pie of corporate profits child labor is a capitalist workaround to increase the labor pool and lower the wages of all those who have to work for a living im embarrassed to be writing an antichild labor article in the year as if this is some charles dickens novel leaking gruel and cruel men it is not as if child labor had ever disappeared of course children around the world toil in fastfashion sweatshops and among the mountains of garbage in other countries but produced by silicon valley this is unfortunately where capitalism is heading and has always been heading children competing with their parents for jobs amid the ruins of societies we sacrificed for profit but for awhile it seemed like child labor might have escaped the empire to live primarily in its colonial subjects child labor was once as rampant in the us as it is in the countries of the developing world in one out of five american children including children as young as were employed a quarter of textile workers in the american south were under the age of in the north factories relied on child labor so heavily that some areas suffered from boy shortages that led to corporate agents traveling the country in search of orphaned children to put to work it is difficult to calculate the total number of legal and illegal child workers in the us today in the agricultural industry alone there are likely hundreds of thousands of children largely from central america a new york times investigation earlier this year found that many us brands directly or indirectly use child labor including lucky charms nature valley ford and j crew while some of that work is legal the federal government at least has been cracking down on illegal child labor the number of minors in child labor violations has increased by since according to the economic policy institute according to the us department of labor over companies illegally employed children in the past fiscal year and one meatpacking company was fined for employing children across different plants legal child labor may seem like an odd turn of phrase but child labor isnt at all banned in the us the fair labor standards act created a federal minimum wage and banned children under from hazardous work but left agricultural workers out of many of its reforms this is why so many children are legally employed and why many agricultural workers in the us do not have a right to a minimum wage these policies allowed the us to maintain its long history of relying on slavery and near slavery for its agricultural wealth and give companies the ability to replace adult workers with children when adult workers demand decent pay an increasingly common occurrence since covid reminded workers of how important they are and how little they are valued the pandemic killed over a million americans many of them workers or potential workers and brought on a wave of retirements that left an even larger hole in the labor market holes like this can increase the value of individual workers and allow them to negotiate for higher wages a trend that followed the bubonic plague in europe the meatprocessing company where duvan was working alluded to the underlying conditions that landed the company with child workers due to an unprecedentedly tight labor market marjac ms relies on staffing companies to fill positions at its facility a statement the company issued in july said while some companies are turning towards automation others are turning towards taking our teens from schools and into factories instead of cutting ceos record salaries corporate leaders and their political allies are fighting to maintain low wages by any means necessary iowa has moved to allow children as young as to work in industrial laundries and meat coolers as well as created a special license to allow some yearolds to drive up to miles for work between am and pm nebraska has moved to join other states in allowing employers to pay people under less than minimum wage as low as an hour these laws are being pushed by groups such as americans for prosperity various chambers of commerce and restaurant associations aiming to hire younger bartenders some legislators characterize the work that killed duvan as potential sources of revenue for struggling immigrant families but this is a macabre policy solution birthed by a sanguinary system instead of putting children to work we

councils police forces and hospitals are putting womens lives at risk by accidentally disclosing domestic abuse victims addresses to perpetrators the uks information watchdog has said john edwards the information commissioner who has reprimanded seven organisations in just over a year for data breaches affecting victims of abuse said this is a pattern that must stop complex databases and a lack of training have been identified as causes of the lapses which nicole jacobs the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales described as extremely dangerous after one data breach involving wakefield council a domestic violence victim and her children had to be urgently rehoused in another involving south wales police the name of a woman trying to check if her partner was a child abuser was disclosed to the man she was trying to use sarahs law which was introduced to provide access to sex offender registers after the murder of eightyearold sarah payne in by a convicted sex offender solicitors and the department for work and pensions were also responsible for data breaches the information commissioners office ico said edwards is calling for data handlers to receive more training and to doublecheck records and contact details and for access to information to be further restricted to reduce the risk of harm every year million women suffer domestic abuse according to the crime survey for england and wales these families reached out for help to escape unimaginable violence to protect them from harm and to seek support to move forward from dangerous situations edwards said but the very people that they trusted to help exposed them to further risk in one case that triggered a reprimand from the ico a woman had approached a subsidiary of the social housing provider bolton at home for help escaping her husband a violent domestic abuser but a staff member left a voicemail on the alleged abusers phone with the womans new address even though he did not know she was planning to leave him the man ended up going to the address in another incident in south wales police told a man with convictions for violence and sexual assault that his parter had applied for information about him under the domestic violence disclosure scheme introduced after the murder of clare wood by her exboyfriend in the wakefield council case it was handling child protection court proceedings when it sent the womans partner documents including the address where she lived with her two children despite her living in fear of the man due to a history of domestic violence the mother and her children had to be moved into emergency alternative accommodation on the same day as the data breach wakefield bolton at home and south wales police have all since introduced remedial measures for victims of domestic abuse a data breach can be a matter of life or death said jacobs there is no room for basic mistakes all organisations that handle victims data must implement proper training robust processes and regular checking farah nazeer the chief executive of the domestic abuse charity womens aid said these highly concerning data breaches have undermined womens safety had severe

why do we tend to bathe children before bed but wash ourselves in the morning ann menzies the wirral send new questions to nqtheguardiancom readers reply because bathing children is a lengthy process it requires extended diplomatic negotiations extravagant bribes and dark threats both to get the child into the water and then to get the child out of the water who would have time for that in the mornings ed couzens no one has time to bathe children in the morning dry them and get them dressed fed and ready and clean the bathroom mess afterwards grasmeregardens sleep leaving a warm bath makes the body temperature go down a bit which induces sleepiness our body temperature drops while we are sleeping so we bathe children before bed to help them get off to sleep reggiepurrin bathing is soothing and can be part of a bedtime routine for children most adults i know rarely take a bath and if they do it is also at night before going to bed adults sometimes bathe at night for the calming effect too but more often they shower in the morning to wake themselves up kids dont need help waking up they open their eyes and are ready to go leah sanft many adults shower in the morning because it helps us wake up and also because we smell when we sweat children dont so we try to minimise embarrassment and we dont want our colleagues to recoil at our stench percenter i always shower before bed never in the morning but as for bathing children before bed thats because they get filthy at nursery or school and with younger children who get up in the night parents believe a bath before bedtime helps the small child relax and so sleep better babylonianshedevil i never shower in the morning i like to go to bed clean and fresh so i always shower or bathe in the evening plus there isnt enough time when i get up it helps everyone including kids unwind and get ready for sleep my partner prefers to shower in the morning but i think hes got it the wrong way round slowee i always shower or bathe in the evenings helps me unwind and the feeling of being all clean in freshly changed sheets is one of the best plus if im perfectly honest if i were showering in the mornings id probably hit the snooze button and skip washing more often than not purpln i find it amusing that in north america most people tend to shower in the morning instead of before bed this means that people carry a days grime and sweat on to their beds i wont say anything about people sleeping with their dogs in asia bathing or showering before bed is the norm this keeps the bed clean not to mention that it is relaxing and makes sleeping so much more pleasant of course if it is a hot night and you sweat a morning shower is usually done so that the day is started fresh and clean some would bath before bedtime and shower in the morning before going to work is that too much not if you want to feel clean and refreshed to each hisher own john yu as a perimenopausal woman who languishes in a sweat bath bed overnight the morning shower is nonnegotiable and the evening shower or bath a total waste princessnutnut im always surprised how much people bathe their kids i used to have a bath once or twice a week when i was a kid im only in my s so this isnt one of those stories of yore but perhaps my parents grew up like this and so thought it would be fine for me too i survived chuffed my dad used to say theres people who shower in the morning before work and people who get real work done and shower when they come home dizzy if youre going to sleep with someone isnt it courteous to shower first dhmp maybe its because kids do dirty things during the day and should therefore be cleaned up before they go to bed whereas adults do dirty things in bed and therefore need to get clean in the morning brnost because grownups can generally eat spaghetti bolognese for dinner without launching it in their own earshairpants maviesdavies who knew people were so firm about this i shower when i feel like i need or want a shower maybe in the morning maybe at night maybe in the middle of the day back when i lived in a place with a nice big bathtub i often did enjoy a hot soak of an evening especially in the cold winter months but that was more for comfort than cleanliness when my daughter was a child we didnt do daily baths either surely that cant be good for a little ones skin i understand some children do play harder than others and may need a washcloth more often but i found every few days was sufficient shangers wait was i supposed to wash today dorkalicious,2023-09,tend bathe child bed

my son has started coding hes only five and i reckon we may have to expand the definition of coding a little but he has joined something called coding club at his school it involves him and his classmates sitting at computers and well im not sure what happens after that since he observes a fight clubstyle omert when it comes to anything he does at school he is familiar with computers and often joins me in my office his baby sisters bedroom while i work on these very articles it would be charming if i could say hes helped much in their writing perhaps offered a paragraph or two youve enjoyed but this has not been the case he mostly enjoys opening a new document and using the keyboard to write the longest rudest words he can spell pootrampoline being a favourite and i am left to do the grunt work myself i read that coding club uses a gamebased platform that enables students to code sprites to move around in different environments in which they make rockets trucks spiders and even cinderella it sounds impressive so i look online to find the module and try it myself i am presented with a cheery little penguin suspended in the void as i move said bird a readout displays his grid coordinates there are dozens of toolbars and dropdown tabs which i presume allow you to do magnificent things with this penguin but after about four minutes i realise i have no idea what im doing and return to my oppressive deadlines my own instruction in computing was mostly at home i was lucky in that my dad was an early adopter who first caught the tech bug in the s as a civil engineer his job had little to do with computers but his fondness for anything square beige and bleeping meant he was drafted as an adhoc it department for his office and our garage soon became an angular graveyard of discarded cpus printers scanners and servers with which he would mess fiddle and occasionally perform resurrections it was here that my little brother and i spent a large part of our childhood setting up battered servers and mounting local area networks to play doom on salvaged pcs we repaid our dad by telling him youre doing it wrong the second our skills overpassed his own the instruction i received in school was paltry in comparison i did my gcse in ict in a year before the curriculum was updated working from decadeold textbooks that referred exclusively to electronic mail and mentioned the internet only briefly by saying as many as million people may soon be on the world wide web an accurate number for would have been m its now almost bn my son among them i wont have

begins with the adult following them around sandpit wendy house playdoh little sit down no get up trains etc the day before my mum had half told me from the kitchen about the hawthorne effect which i gathered from the hallway describes the way people perform differently when they know theyre being observed and the phrase rattled around in my head as i enthusiastically crouched down among the dinosaurs aware of the other adults who appeared to be nonchalant i was trying to play really well i realised to be the best at playing i had to go inside for a bit and have a word with myself i was and not for the first time envious of the toddlers who are allowed to simply whiz around a space singing single ladies and if another child approaches when theyre not ready to talk find it acceptable to simply say nope and keep on whizzing on the second and third days the adults continue to play occasionally taking tea while sequestered in a bright little room it was while sitting here settling in that the concept started not just to make sense to me but to offer itself as a solution to so much more than simply nursery school we have tools to help us relax into difficult situations tools which include alcohol and small talk but rarely do we have a period of time set aside for somebody to help guide us from one stage of life into another the stages of life are generally broken up into seven or eight including adolescence and late adulthood but within each of these arent there seven or eight substages each one of which requires a certain period of settling in i guess i am in middle adulthood the costume of which is a carefully balanced combination of teva veja and windbreaker our hair splitting symbolically at its ends and it is becoming clear that in this stage i could do with assistance navigating a new transition every six to eight months currently these substages land in my psyche like dumped mattresses curling in the rain a combination of realisations whoops i forgot to learn to drive and emotions and incomprehensible leaps in time like ok the sudden shift from at feeling sexy wise and fundamentally lovely to one day around realising you are no longer a human woman but instead a sort of deflated bag for life halffilled with mince dragging itself between bed bar and playground emitting small caffeinated groans or what about the doubleheader of im actually quite good at my job well done to oh no im bad at my job and hang on my job is bullshit the capitalist system depends on me believing the deception of work as liberation and couldnt eliminating tax loopholes for the rich practically fund a universal basic income a warm gentle hand on the shoulder perhaps as each stage comes into view easing you gently onwards there is a moment in the mids for many when after a tumultuous few years of maybe fear maybe guilt or grief maybe hope maybe something looser that lives creakily in the chest a peace arrives with the knowledge that you need never think again about the possibility of having kids for this the settling in period might take a little while faster but more urgent is the substage when it feels suddenly terribly urgent that you get fit something rearranges and you are aware of such new words as cholesterol and prostate and you start feverishly exercising or else start worrying about not feverishly exercising if youre lucky it coincides with the bit where you must come to terms with such realities as care for the first time of the younger and the older and then the bit where you decide right thats it ive got to finally grow up and oh god someone to settle you into settling down and its lasagne of anxieties learning to put away your independence for best learning to breathe through the weeks when you worry about what it means to never fall in love again the stopping midway through a conversation about mould with the choking realisation of how far you have come since the night you two walked until dawn and kissed in the underpass an elder a wiser a someone to hold on to your water bottle and cut the apple up small on the third day of settling in my son wanted to clarify something with me before we parked his scooter and went inside would he be coming here tomorrow too yes and tomorrow and tomorrow and the next tomorrow yes and would he be coming to nursery on every single tomorrow forever and would i be

claire always dreamed of setting up a childminding business in her home so this year she applied for training through a company called tiney before she could go any further she was told she needed permission from her landlord after a month of waiting for an update claire was told in july that the local authority had said no citing health and safety it said her twobedroom councilowned property was too small claire from the west midlands argues that she has a garden and a park nearby and that her flat is not cramped i have a living room its not small but an average size and i can set up an arts and crafts table she says her plans are now on hold to make matters worse she claims the council is ignoring her appeal i have fibromyalgia a condition that causes pain all over the body she says i have two children of my own and im willing to put myself out there and do something i love to help other parents it feels unfair they are telling me to get a grant and rent a building but im currently not working her story is not unique tiney a leading childminder agency says of prospective applicants drop out because their landlord or local authority etc does not agree to let them run their business from home it comes amid a crisis in childcare in the uk with official data showing that between august and august the early years sector lost providers with most of that because of a sharp fall in the number of childminders at the end of august last year there were fewer ofstedregistered childminders than there were in august currently childminders living in rented accommodation must obtain written permission from their landlord or if they live in a councilowned property their local authority however tiney says childminders operate under strict ratios in england they can care for a maximum of six children under the age of eight and it adds that they are all regularly inspected by or on behalf of ofsted the issue was recently raised by the children and families minister at the time claire coutinho who said that too often prospective childminders were having the door slammed in their faces and called on housing associations landlords and developers to let childminders work from their rented properties to help encourage entry into the profession and increase availability of childcare laura a prospective childminder from london says she was so excited to embark on my new career as a childminder running her own small business i made it through each stage of the process without any difficulty but fell down at the last hurdle she says living in a property owned by a housing association means i need to get permission before offering childcare services from home i didnt expect to encounter problems with this i thought if anything my plans would be welcomed as id be helping the local community by offering affordable childcare but i was rejected and given no clear reason behind their decision ive been in touch several times since but received the same flat no she says she describes it as heartbreaking to have her dream halted by something totally beyond her control she says im currently working in a care home but its young children i really want to build my career around im seriously considering moving house in order to pursue this uprooting my family isnt my ideal solution but it feels like the last option available to me last month coutinho wrote to housing associations social landlords and others to urge them to provide better support to prospective childminders saying this would help tackle the unfair barriers confronting those who rent or live in a leasehold property compared with those who own their own home however in response the national residential landlords association claimed housing providers were not the issue and called for mortgage lenders and insurers to be more flexible as well as for tenancy deposits to be allowed to reflect the greater risk of damage to properties used for childminding brett wigdortz the chief executive of tiney and the founder of the educational charity teach first says it is true that some landlords are supportive however the idea that tenancy deposits should be larger for childminders falsely suggests that the profession is a destructive or careless one he adds it disregards the competency of these early years professionals childminders operate under strict adulttochild ratios and must pass home safeguarding checks that require their settings to be kept to a high standard far from damaging a property childminding offers an added incentive to maintain a welcoming environment he says wigdortz says that while insurers and mortgage lenders can make things easier by recognising that opening a childminding service does not alter the propertys domestic function landlords also need to be willing to have that initial conversation with their insurer and mortgage lender and not jump to the conclusion that this will be costly for them he says he constantly hears stories like lauras adding prospective childminders are going to great lengths to meet their local authoritys demands weve seen them provide solutions to every objection raised by councils and in some cases even obtain written consent from each of their neighbours but the outcome remains the same theres no way of knowing how many excellent candidates rule out a childminding career before embarking on a training programme because they think they wont get permission from their landlord across the uk its likely that thousands of people are prevented from becoming childminders because of this arbitrary process says wigdortz adding that this disproportionately affects those from deprived areas a local government association spokesperson says given the restrictions some childminders face when working from their home and the need to attract more people to the profession councils are in favour of more flexible measures to make it easier for those living in rental and leasehold properties this needs to be balanced against the safety of children and quality of provision offered which should always be the most important consideration,2023-09,claire always dreamed setting childminding business home year

children and young people have become significantly more concerned about rising prices and their family having enough money than about the environment or crime research has found one in children aged to are unhappy with their lives according to a study by the childrens society more than million children in the uk are estimated in the report to be more worried about rising prices than they are the environment while almost million do not feel positive about the future of the country or the future of the world future financial security however is the issue that most troubles the younger generation more than one in three young people worry about having enough money in their future four in five parents or carers are concerned about the impact of the cost of living on their families the report also shows that girls are significantly less happy than boys with everything in their lives except for schoolwork life is just too hard for too many children said mark russell ceo of the childrens society it is a national scandal that childrens happiness continues to slide it is really shocking that almost half of all young people feel gloomy about the state of our world we need real leadership from government to turn this around he added the need for improving childrens wellbeing is urgent nil gzelgn policy and campaigns manager at mind said young people are bearing the brunt of the worst cost of living crisis in a generation with almost a third of children in britain living in poverty its sadly unsurprising that so many are now feeling the impact on their wellbeing the report was published on the same day that a study by the food bank charity the trussell trust found half of working households on universal credit payments ran out of food last month and were unable to buy more universal credit the main uk benefit for those on low incomes or out of work is claimed by million people the basic rate is at least a month below the real cost of food energy and other basics the study which estimates that people on universal credit have had to turn to charity food in the last month also found working families on universal credit had struggled to heat their home were more likely to skip meals and go without toiletries russell said that against this background it is little surprise that the childrens society research found the overall happiness of young people was at its lowest point since the survey began years ago with the younger generation significantly more unhappy about every key element of their lives than ever before except their families jonathan townsend uk chief executive of the princes trust said the findings provided a stark reminder that the rising cost of living is having a debilitating impact on young peoples wellbeing and aspirations for the future yesterday we released research which showed that continued economic uncertainty and financial pressures are taking a significant toll on young peoples career ambitions and life goals with the majority feeling anxious unconfident and hopeless about their plans for their future barry fletcher ceo of youth futures foundation said that more than young people were not in employment education or training a rise over the last two years we need to create longterm solutions that support young people helping them to find good quality jobs and a brighter future he said the childrens society is calling for an increase to child benefits creating cabinetlevel posts of minister for children in both the uk and welsh governments and for the government to measure childrens subjective wellbeing on an annual basis especially that of girls,2023-09,child young people become significantly concerned rising price family enough money environment crime research ha found one child aged

children whose fathers read play sing and draw with them show a small but significant increase in their educational attainment at primary school according to research that suggests just minutes a day could make a difference while it has long been recognised that parental engagement is critical for a childs education and development a study led by the university of leeds claims fathers have a unique and important effect on childrens educational outcomes it found that greater involvement by fathers before their child attends primary school gives an educational advantage to children in their first year while greater involvement at the age of five helps increase attainment in key stage assessments at seven the effect is slightly more pronounced in maths the study which was funded by the economic and social research council drew a distinction between the impact of mothers and fathers while fathers involvement had an impact on educational attainment mothers had more of an impact on emotional and social behaviours the study recommends that fathers should carve out as much time as they can to engage in playful and educational activities with their children each week engaging in multiple types of structured activities several times a week even if just for short periods of time helps to enrich a childs cognitive and language development the study concludes just minutes a day could have beneficial impacts it also recommends that schools and early years education providers should routinely take both parents contact details where possible and develop positive strategies to engage fathers it suggests that the schools inspectorate ofsted should consider father engagement in inspections dr helen norman a research fellow at leeds university business school who led the research said mothers still tend to assume the primary carer role and therefore tend to do the most childcare but if fathers actively engage in childcare too it significantly increases the likelihood of children getting better grades in primary school this is why encouraging and supporting fathers to share childcare with the mother from an early stage in the childs life is critical the study published on wednesday is based on a representative sample of almost motherfather households in england drawn from the millennium cohort study which collected data on children born which was linked to the official educational records of children from the early years foundation stage profile at age five and the national pupil database at age seven fathers involvement had a positive effect on a childs attainment regardless of the childs gender ethnicity age in the school year or household income the study acknowledged the significant detrimental effects of early poverty on educational attainment helen dodd a professor of child psychology at exeter medical school said this is a strong piece of research showing the importance of parent involvement in childrens development it is particularly interesting that they found that fathers and mothers involvement might be linked to different outcomes for children with fathers involvement linked particularly to broad educational outcomes whereas mothers involvement was more closely linked to overall wellbeing attention mental health and social skills this may reflect the different ways that mothers and fathers might play with and interact with their children within traditional parenting roles in twoparent heterosexual families it serves to highlight the important role that fathers have it is important though to keep in mind that irrespective of the structure of a family children benefit when their parents engage in these types of playful creative activities with their child andrew gwynne the chair of the allparty parliamentary group on fatherhood said this study shows that even small changes in what fathers do and in how schools and early years settings engage with parents can have a lasting impact on childrens learning its absolutely crucial that fathers arent treated as an afterthought,2023-09,child whose father read play sing draw show small significant increase educational attainment primary

we were touched by our sons reticence to leave our company and go back to school so reminded him wed just be across the road we were speaking literally here since his school is on our street and this year his entrance directly faces our front door its cut our second commute down to a few seconds but this was still too great a distance for our homesick boy i used to travel for half an hour to get to primary school i told him and a full hour for secondary id like to think i intended this as a comfort but now realise it was that inescapable reflex of fatherly oneupmanship ive inherited from my own dad if we grumbled about having to travel the last two miles home from school on foot hed say we didnt know we were born he of course travelled to and from school by clambering into the wooden spokes of a passing horsecart and happily rotated for the full nine hours it took to reach his destination sensing some gentler treatment was needed my wife told our boy that if he stands by the door of his classroom he can still see us across the road with this he toddled in slightly reassured i cant remember my own first days back to school very well i dont recall much homesickness but this would probably have been impossible since i was joining a school that five of my siblings were already attending the record came the following year when my sister fionnualas entry to reception brought our familys count up to seven if i strain i can just about remember a vague sense of excitement and alarm and the halting awkwardness of seeing old friends for the first time in two months my sons gleaming uniform evokes that same sweet plastic smell i remember from my own uncommonly clean back school clothes the perfect respectability of which was undone by their ill fit we wore these uniforms to paraphrase raymond chandler like a horse wears a stable each having been bought a size and a half too big so as to accommodate our wearing it for the entire year as such we spent the first months of every school year perched within the inner core of a billowing polyester exoskeleton like sigourney weaver operating the power loader in aliens and if we complained about this my father helpfully reminded us that his school clothes were made from moss and sticks and did him for years my sons uniform was no longer gleaming when i picked him up but he seemed to have gotten over the worst of his nerves until he saw his mum that is and all talk was of betrayal it turns out that when shed said he could see us from his room meaning our house generally hed taken this concept quite literally and had like james stewart in rear window ventured out several times to said vantage point and been upset not to see us standing there holding vigil until his return we cant stand outside all day i said as he sniffled we live indoors now your granda on the other hand he actually grew up in a house without walls well i say a house it was more like a hedge this article was amended on september an

love isnt just for the young and taut of buttock thats the obvious yet still somehow revolutionary premise of my mum your dad itvs new dating show in which a bunch of twentysomething children oversee their nervous middleaged parents attempts to find love in a country house stuffed with fellow singletons originally billed as a kind of geriatric love island the first few episodes are shaping up to be something much more interesting not least because the format is surprisingly kind by the standards of reality tv think the gentle solidarity of the bake off tent rather than the psychologically twisted big brother house the emphasis is firmly and rather touchingly on the vulnerability of the fiftysomethings venturing uncertainly on to the dating scene in some cases a good three decades after they thought theyd left all that behind for good but what really makes the show is the addition of their adult children as a kind of fiercely protective greek chorus fondly observing via hidden cameras the singletons rusty efforts at flirtation and working benevolently to steer events from afar the opening scenes trailing the overgrown kids as they pack their nervous parents off to their new digs with a few last soothing words of advice could not more closely mirror the ritual of dropping your firstborn off for freshers week if they tried except this time the roles of parent and child are well and truly reversed nothing like youve gone for in the past says yearold tia firmly as she hugs her mum goodbye were going for nice men as connections start tentatively to form the relationship between the watching children meanwhile morphs into that mix of mutual supportiveness and vigilance familiar to anyone who has ever stood in the parental huddle at soft play halfwaiting for the first fouryearold to cause a scene by pushing someone elses child off the slide the whole thing is in short an unexpectedly tender reworking of the unmistakable turning point in family life where parents suddenly find themselves meekly submitting to the guidance of their child who appears to have become a functioning grownup overnight when nobody was looking while those children experience the blinding revelation that their parents are not just people in their own right but ones occasionally in need of looking after when that switch is flipped too early it can of course be disastrous forcing teenage children to become responsible for chaotic parents before their time but done right theres something intensely moving about this particular rite of passage and perhaps particularly so in singleparent families for at its heart this show is that rarest of hens teeth a love letter to lone parenthood and to the intense bonds often created when its just you and them against the world again and again adult sons and daughters talked affectionately to camera about parents who had uncomplainingly put their lives on the backburner for years while bringing them up and who didnt deserve a lonely old age in return the most moving thing about filming the series its host davina mccall has said was the idea that as a child you cant move on with your life until you feel that your parent is happy theres a danger in overly romanticising that worry of course when the children of happily married parents can take off into the world without a backwards look blithely assuming theyll simply look after each other some will wonder too why single parents should ever have been expected to mothball their lives in the first place why women in particular seem so often to be harshly judged for breaking what the writer stacey duguid in her new postdivorce memoir in pursuit of happiness calls the ultimate taboo and putting themselves first when they still have children at home but that doesnt change the reality now for a generation who often did feel they had no choice but to put their lives on hold and who are now emptynesters struggling to pick up the threads of their old selves in a world brutally transformed by dating apps and shifting sexual expectations this is just what middle age is going to look like for millions in a country where of couples who married in didnt make it to their th wedding anniversary according to those old romantics at the office for national statistics they deserve better than a culture that all too often treats the idea of fiftysomethings falling in

eighteen summers ago my partner and i came home from hospital with a newborn all three of us were exhausted only our daughter with her perfect fingernails nature looks after the first manicure and its matchless was sleeping her parents were wide awake and wired rattled like any new parents by the prospect of the unknown as we carried this tiny human into the house for the first time i remember feeling sharply as though our whole world had been picked up and put down somewhere else that we knew where everything was but didnt know where we were last weekend that same young person left home for university and the emotional dislocation is back i have absolutely no idea what feelings to expect either immediately when she isnt just a headroundthedoor away or as the days tick on and the absence of one quarter of the family becomes the new normal will we cry of course well cry were middleaged we cry at everything will we worry of course well worry were parents but how will we worry will it be the worry weve always worried or will it be a new variant omicron worry parenthood is one long goodbye the child leaves the womb she leaves the cot at the foot of the bed she comes off the draught then says farewell to the bottle she runs off in a park or a zoo both actually for the first time she starts nursery shes too heavy to carry up the stairs after a long car journey she starts walking to school alone she starts choosing what she wears and how she looks she starts doing her own thing at the weekend she stays out and gets back after youve gone to bed bye see ya bye and you get used to the farewell carousel but this is palpably different the strangenesses are many adding an address under her name in our contacts where there had never been one before because why would there be we all live in the same place and always have i go through the shopping list ive carried in my head for years organised aisle by aisle because i treat the weekly shop like a military overthetop and see that about a quarter of it is now crossed out but will i remember these deletions in the heat of battle or will i come home file something in the fridge and look at it three weeks later wondering why its untouched and going out of date i try to rehearse ways of thinking about this new normal shes just upstairs in her room like she always was except that instead of being on the floor above shes now several hundred miles upstairs shell be back at christmas christmas its c outside and im wearing shorts quality street isnt even legal at this time of year what about her younger brother how will he manage the sistershaped hole in his world will he be getting a psychological invoice for this at some point a therapist told me some years ago that sibling relationships are an absurdly underexcavated seam the two of them have always looked after each other can they do that on facetime were a threeperson household now that hasnt been the case since he was born its as if were reversing out of parenthood the way we came in from no child in the house to one peaking at two then back to one again and in a few years time all the way back to none well still be parents of course just parents of kids sorry what with different addresses yes while were here sod you the english language for never bothering to find a word for adult offspring you must have known that the word child was going to grow up one day tsk the day after dropping our daughter off at her student accommodation we distracted ourselves by wandering around an anthropological museum and i found myself confronted with a showcase full of spent birds nests even my sense of humour thought this was a bit on the nose besides ours is not an empty nest its just one fledgling lighter i think about the next time well see each other more time apart will have elapsed than ever so well notice how each other has aged and changed and well notice noticing and the first of the omicron worries arrives is there something we missed when we had an year chance to do it and is it too late now here we are again life picked up and put down somewhere else the second act heres hoping it isnt a letdown after the

my son has only recently discovered youtube but his interests are restricted exclusively to those videos which further his obsession with maths numberblocks mainly as well as kidfriendly explorations of mathrelated phenomena which he adores as they fly over his head were sanguine about all this because weve done the sums and are prepared for his eyes to go a little square if it allows him an hour a day to refuel his list of maths questions rather than repeating the same ones to us ad nauseum but mostly were hoping it will rub off on his little sister who has yet to take to screen time at all at the moment since birth in fact her relationship to us is less child and parent and more koala and tree for several hours each day she insists on being carried and no book toy or activity can dissuade her from this pleasure my wife and i realised some time ago that the backpain we share is from lifting and holding her for so much of every day but on the plus side weve learned a lot about those things we can and cannot do onehanded cracking frying and serving an egg yes buttering a single slice of toast no when he was her age my sons poison was baby shark so we turned to it for the first time in five years to see if it might work the same magic on her watching it now evokes a bittersweet sensation of time not just passing but being deleted entirely i know i watched this video thousands of times yet it seems impossibly ancient i remember our first goround with the adolescent selachimorph as a time of deadening grind although remember might be the wrong word this was december so i look up what else was going on then hoping i could compare how well i remembered the news stories of the time to the blankness with which baby shark now stares back at me with its dead dolls eyes i find i cant remember any of the news stories either likely because i was subsisting on two hours of trembling sleep a day the gatwick drones a waferthin sliver of remembrance the yellow vests movement a blur of french traffic jams and the vaguely understood aims of men in hivis and with no little embarrassment and my sincerest apologies to his family i can confirm that i have only now learned of the death of george hw bush even though it leaves us cold baby shark offers my son a flicker of distant recognition and he screws his face up in that how do i know you way he does when he meets an auntie he hasnt seen in a while my daughter however is entranced she jolts eyes popping as if no song has ever rung so sweet in her ear she claps her hands and approaches the screen with an addicts rapt attention my son loses interest and begins posing maths problems again but we dont mind if he has to pepper us with equations for his sister to loosen her grip its worth it weve done

ive got nothing ive worked for years and the only asset i have is my pension i have no savings no home and my credit rating is destroyed because of the credit cards and loans he took out in my name everything i thought we owned we didnt two years ago ruth dodsworth a television journalist and weather presenter gave a number of interviews disclosing that she had been a victim of domestic abuse for almost a decade her now exhusband jonathan wignall phoned her up to times a day tracked her movements and was physically abusive in wignall was sentenced to three years in prison for stalking and coercive or controlling behaviour he served months dodsworth claims he continues to pursue her for half her pension its only now however that she is speaking out about the economic abuse that she also experienced to help others she says she failed to understand the implications of what was happening to her at the time she told the observer ive a degree yet i didnt have my own bank account you think how can that have happened he took every penny of my salary if i asked for money for lunch at work he would give me exactly for a tesco meal deal work colleagues asked me for lunch and id have to make excuses so the isolation increased i never saw mail or bills i didnt realise economic abuse was part of coercive control i certainly didnt realise it would have ramifications for the rest of my life dodsworth is one of a number of women whose experiences feature in an important report seen yet sidelined published on monday by the charity surviving economic abuse sea the report analyses successful prosecutions of the offence of coercive or controlling behaviour that have been reported in the media over the eight years since it became a criminal offence in in england and wales even in financial abuse defined by sea as control of money and finances and economic abuse described as control of the resources that money can buy such as food clothes and mobile phones as well as the sabotaging of career prospects was not explicitly recognised in law as part of coercive or controlling behaviour largely as a result of seas campaigning that was rectified in the domestic abuse act in seen but sidelined twothirds of the cases reference economic abuse and half also feature physical abuse while the report focuses only on cases published in the press it gives an indication of how police agencies and the courts are responding or not to the offence strikingly in only of the cases did survivors receive any compensation for their losses yet in seven of the cases the total debts amounted to economic abuse used to go undocumented and unpunished said nicola sharpjeffs the founder and chief executive of sea it is better recognised now but awareness by victimsurvivors themselves is poor while police appear to rank economic abuse at the bottom when assessing risk yet in two of the cases in the report the perpetrator was found guilty of manslaughter a context of such control that the victim felt she had no choice but to take her own life in the cases in the report threequarters of those convicted received a custodial sentence although the offence carries a sentence up to five years the mean length of time spent in prison was only months if additional offences were also proved for example stalking or criminal damage the average length of sentence was months three life sentences were given the conclusion that the report draws is that coercive or controlling behaviour in england and wales is viewed less seriously than other domestic abuse offences and may be downgraded further by plea bargaining the wording of the law also means that coercive or controlling behaviour is seen as a standalone crime instead of being part of an overarching offence in which sexual physical economic and psychological abuse play constituent parts as it is in the scottish system in scotland because it is seen as a gendered crime it does not include family members as the england and wales legislation does and carries a prison sentence of up to years survivors tell us that coercive or controlling behaviour is the most dangerous aspect of their abuse said dr cassandra wiener author of coercive control and the criminal law yet the fiveyear prison sentence cap reinforces the message that there is a hierarchy of harm with physical abuse at the top and coercive or controlling behaviour at the bottom in one case in the sea report the perpetrator caused the victim to build up in debts in another the perpetrator gave his partner a weekly allowance of in p pieces he financially rinsed me one victim said how can that happen coercive behaviour is a course of conduct not a single event such as a physical assault wiener said a victim is subject to the arbitrary control of the perpetrator deprived of all rights and stripped of her autonomy the victim is terrorised by a fear of what might happen to herself and her children if she fails to comply to rules that often change constantly its as if shes in a permanent state of siege irya not her real name had risen to a senior position during nearly two decades in global banking when she married her husband in a month before he had attacked her it was a big wedding she said i couldnt call it off over the next two years she was hospitalised several times suffering brain damage in her husband was convicted of coercive or controlling behaviour he was sentenced to two and a half years and was released after six months thats what worth of lawyers buys you irya said when i was with him i had to pay for everything in the house he wouldnt allow me hot showers physical abuse was always the response if i objected it only stopped in when i thought he was going to kill me the implications of my economic abuse that have unfolded since i couldnt have foreseen five years on irya is homeless unemployed and because of markers on her credit rating cannot get a job in banking a mortgage a mobile phone contract or a car lease all impediments to her new business i was trapped he wouldnt agree to selling the house the building society wouldnt let me rent without his permission he stopped paying his half of the mortgage i had to pay each time a barrister went to court to push for an order of sale on the house i had to sell my jewellery and my personal possessions i was sleeping in my car i explained to my building society but it constantly harassed me protocols exist it should have treated me as a vulnerable customer but to this day it has failed to recognise my situation its harassment has turned me into a nervous wreck its almost as bad as the original abuse protocols do exist as does legislation that would permit victims to be compensated and the sea website lists the steps a woman experiencing the aftermath of economic abuse can take allied irish bank for example provides personal loans to those who have a poor credit score as a result of to domestic abuse natalie curtis a health and safety manager spent six years with her now exhusband he insisted that all loans bills and credit cards be in her name because he was selfemployed these included a loan which he immediately transferred to his own account and a bmw car bought on credit he was physically abusive destroyed her property and called her dozens of times a day in he was sentenced to three years for coercive or controlling behaviour one of the first convictions under the new offence he had made me financially destitute i couldnt even afford the diesel to get to work i had kept a diary and recorded his behaviour curtis said i did it for my own sanity because he kept telling me i was mentally ill and over the top but it helped in his prosecution curtis claims that the perpetrator left her with worth of debt supported by sea she utilised the financial abuse code of practice a banking industry initiative and worked with the specialist domestic abuse team at lloyds bank so that the majority of loans that her exhusband had taken out in her name were eventually returned to her account it took a long time but it was lifechanging for me five years on im debtfree but i was hoping to buy a house and i discovered there was a county court judgment against me for a parking fine he racked up thousands of pounds worth of fines curtis is now a domestic abuse campaigner among the many recommendations the sea report makes is to follow the canadian example and establish restitution orders they can address a victimsurvivors credit history or rating sharpjeffs said it is vital to find a solution so that a womans own creditworthiness is reflected and not the abuse she experienced sea is also lobbying for the victims and prisoners bill currently going through parliament to place a duty on public bodies to provide economic advocacy services as part of victim support sea also wants to see mandatory training on economic abuse for police and criminal justice agencies i found bags and bags of unopened letters and bills dodsworth said but as far as the police were concerned the economic abuse was a sideline a minor interest other sea recommendations include a government fund to recompense survivors for debts until the perpetrator can foot the bill an audit of an offenders assets rarely implemented in the cases in the report and better government collaboration with financial institutions so evidence can be more easily gathered sea believes that awareness of economic abuse should be taught in schools and research conducted into how factors such as religion disability and honourbased violence relate to economic abuse cases dodsworth who has since remarried said if i hadnt left when i did he would have killed me on that night or the next im in a far happier place now but i have nothing to leave my children for someone who has worked all her life thats a bitter pill to swallow,2023-09,ive got nothing ive worked year asset pension saving home credit rating destroyed

domestic abusers leaving prison will have to wear electronic monitoring tags in a move that the government says will offer better protection to victims under a pilot scheme launching in the east and west midlands and expected to be rolled out across england and wales next year any offender who poses a threat to a former partner or their children will be banned from going within a certain distance of a victims home andor subject to a curfew the conditions will be enforced on up to prison leavers who will be forced to wear a gps or curfew tag offenders who breach licence conditions such as by entering an exclusion zone or breaching a curfew face being returned to prison the lord chancellor and justice secretary alex chalk said survivors of domestic abuse show great strength and bravery in coming forward and it is right that every tool is used to protect them from further harm the tagging of prison leavers at risk of committing further domestic abuse is a further protection we are introducing to help victims rebuild their lives and feel safe in their communities the government also said on friday that more than victims had been protected from further harassment from their imprisoned abusers thanks to a prison service scheme relaunched last summer the unwanted prisoner contact service prevents offenders from dialling a victims number from prison phones or sending out threatening letters to their address louise a survivor of domestic violence said the thought of my abuser trying to make contact either from behind bars or once released was one that left me feeling anxious and powerless these measures provide reassurance that we as survivors are being better protected from these efforts to intimidate and terrorise us nicole jacobs the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales said i welcome announcements from government today to tackle perpetrators of domestic abuse the domestic abuse electronic tags pilot is a positive step forwards in protecting victims by blocking perpetrators from contacting victims the unwanted prisoner contact scheme sets an important standard that the criminal justice system will not be used to further domestic abuse making a difference for survivors safety recovery and freedom from abuse for too long the onus has been on victims of domestic abuse to protect themselves from harm i will continue to work with

my baby loves the rain it seems she reaches out and tries to grab handfuls of it in her gummy paws legs kicking in ecstasy she looks up to feel the splashes on her face straining against the straps of her buggy and rendering its protective awning solely decorative ive stepped out to collect the kids and it is really pelting down what began as a downpour is now a torrent and great big stair rods are pummelling the pavement as we make the short trip home she takes after me clearly i enjoy rain and the lack of it here is one of my main problems with london when i tell londoners this they act as if im mad but the fact is london gets about days of rain a year in the part of the derrydonegal border where i grew up the equivalent number is i didnt realise it was something id ever miss i certainly dont think i loved it as a child rain was so ever present in my childhood that enjoying it would have been like enjoying air or mass or homemade country music and yet here i gasp for it my wife has no such sentiment and has become used to a furtive look i get when heavy rain occurs its the same dart of unclean joy i get if i spot a caterer milling around with hors doeuvres at a wedding i try to keep my delight to myself for decorums sake but i cannot if im unaware she prods me as if my favourite song has come on the radio and watches me race like a dog to the nearest window so i can fawn at it through the glass on particularly heavy downpours ive had to exchange the glance the one that tells her i will be leaving my place on the couch to put my coat on and go out into it whatever time of day or night it is this i do yelping with delight while i presume she remains on the couch scheduling her many and varied extramarital affairs my son unfortunately takes after his mother in his ambivalence to rain not cuckoldry as his sister and i laugh in the downpour he glowers with revulsion he is distressed by the discomfort inarguable i must concede of having his body soaked by freezing water i try to offer him my usual bromides about there being no such thing as bad weather merely the wrong clothes but he is unmoved for one thing im the one who sent him off to school this morning wearing a corduroy jacket that is proving about as waterresistant as a trifle sponge so its a bit rich coming from me not least since i am wearing the huge hydrophobic parka i reserve for my little rain jaunts once we return inside i wring his corduroy into the sink get him into his jammies and we all sit on the sofa under a blanket i try to cheer him up by telling him this time next week well be in derry with his grandad does it rain as much there he asks not exactly as much no i tell him and save that conversation for another rainy day did ye hear mammy died by samas oreilly is out now

the biggest independent providers of childrens care in england made profits of more than m last year as concern mounts over the conditions that some children are being placed in and the spiralling costs for councils fee income for the largest operators of independent childrens care totalled bn last year a increase on the previous year and of that m was recorded as profit according to an independent analysis half of the top providers have some private equity or sovereign wealth fund ownership council spending on independent childrens care in england has more than doubled in six years in spending on independently run residential care for vulnerable children increased by on the previous year this comes with the number of children in care at its highest level since before the pandemic in england there are also concerns among councils over the indebtedness of some of the main providers the report was commissioned from revolution consulting by the local government association lga which worried that increasing fees were putting council budgets under immense pressure the report also raised concerns about financial transparency in the sector given a significant rise in mergers and acquisitions one company to increase profits last year was your chapter holdings accounts out this month show profits rising from m to m the company was formerly called care children but changed its name after criticisms over the care it provided just last month ofsted warned that your chapter had failed to sufficiently improve one home which it had deemed inadequate it stated there are serious andor widespread failures that mean children and young people are not protected or their welfare is not promoted or safeguarded a spokesperson for the provider said we strive continuously to improve and to provide the best possible care and education for the children and young people in our care katharine sacksjones chief executive of the become charity for children in care and young care leavers said there are serious questions to ask when we have a care system in crisis a chronic shortage of homes for children local councils struggling and private providers making everincreasing profits we know children in private provision are more likely to be placed away from their local area and the people and places that matter to them children in care who have experienced significant trauma must not be seen as a commodity this is public money that should be spent on providing a system where children get the support and stability they need local authorities report spending bn on childrens social care in compared with bn in senior figures fear childrens social care is affecting all other areas of spending what matters most for children who cant live with their birth parents is that they feel safe loved and supported in homes that best suit their needs said louise gittins chair of the lgas children and young people board while many providers work hard to make sure this is the case it is wrong that some are making excessive profit from this as the report shows spending on residential care placements for children has increased dramatically in recent years as councils have sought to find the best homes for record numbers of children in care while mergers and acquisitions have seen some large independent providers grow significantly yet while councils are having to divert more and more money away from early help services and into homes for children in care the largest privately run companies continue to bring in huge profits the childrens homes association said it shared these concerns particularly at levels of debt carried by large private equity providers but that this did not reflect the sector as a whole the majority of our members are micro or small providers that achieve small margins to ensure the viability of their organisations and critically are not carrying significant levels of debt it said the independent sector consistently provides care at a significantly lower cost than local authorities this combined with caring for a higherneed cohort of children and young people demonstrates value for money this article was amended on october an earlier version of the headline and article said that the biggest private providers of childrens homes made profits of more than m last year this figure was for childrens

my son has recently started reading to his sister this is adorable but it also happens to be convenient since my wife and i are well within that phase of life where any act of sitting on the floor is to be rationed if not avoided entirely so at least once or twice a week he now takes our place thumbing through her thickcard picture books and reciting their humdrum contents to his delighted charge there is an aspect of the performative here he is old enough to know when hes being cute and that said cuteness is usually rewarded but all artifice is inevitably forgotten once he becomes rapt himself leaving them giggling together on the carpet theirs is an unavoidably unequal relationship hes five and shes one and a half a gap large enough that my son feels no threat to his superiority and she no awareness that such a hierarchy might even exist as a result he is a good brother if inconsistent he vacillates between adoring and ignoring full of cuddles and kisses one minute grabbing things out of her hand as if shes furniture the next if i had to give him a rating itd be a she would probably give him a the happiest i see her every day is when i pick her up from nursery and her absurd little head explodes with smiles shes stretched and slimmed a little from her earliest days but her face still boasts the soft squareness of the stay puft marshmallow man i take what personal joy i can from her greeting before she is strapped in her buggy at which point her attention turns instantaneously to her big brother she knows were off to pick him up and begins chanting his name eighteen months in its the word she says better than any other and she repeats it nonstop for the entirety of the fiveminute journey to his school by the time we arrive she is waving her arms and kicking her legs in paroxysms of delight for a long time i thought i just had good timing an instinctive knack for turning up at the school gates just as he was coming out of the building to greet us i now know that his teachers have simply learned to recognise the slowly increasing volume of her insane siren song which precedes our arrival like clockwork and sometimes it must be said this adoration is indistinguishable from malice as when she punches him for no reason or pulls his hair both intrinsic phrases within any babys love language mostly trouble starts when her wish to sit beside him transforms via some logic known only to her into a desire to sit on top of him within him even stumped by the limits of euclidean geometry she cries in frustration as her attempts to occupy the same dimensional space as another object fails entirely my son used to bristle at this but now he knows what to do he pats her on the head and coos reaching across the carpet for a book he makes

it is unlikely the children clambering over the worlds first d climbing frame had any idea they were helping to explore higher dimensional geometry irregular polytopes or string theoretical physics but they unquestionably had fun they loved it and my kids are coming tomorrow so im very excited said gemma andersontempini an artist after road testing her climbing frame with leeds youngsters before school started on thursday for me this is a dream come true because it has been almost impossible to make as a climbing experience its very different to what people will have tried there are all these interesting angles and ways to twist around she added the frame is in the front garden of a huge empty victorian house in leeds that andersontempini has transformed into a kind of string theory playground there are drawings and installations in different rooms that are challenging but accessible and all exploring the scientific theory of the fourth spatial dimension an ideathat was popularised in the th century by charles howard hinton and other mathematicians hinton also made a climbing frame which he used to teach his children about maths his son sebastian who later patented the jungle gym recalled fond memories of his father commanding x y z go andersontempinis frame and other works in the house play on that history the installation and she built a crooked house has been created after years of working with alessio corti professor of pure mathematics at imperial college london but what is the fourth spatial dimension well we know about length width and depth says a spirit world voice in a room set up for a seance the fourth dimension is an extension of this beyond what our senses can perceive of course there is a lot more to it but the hope is that people ignorant of the fourth spatial dimension might have some idea by the time they leave or even if they do not they will have had fun trying to understand the idea another room is accessed only through a narnialike wardrobe of coats inside it is a remarkable mirrored infinity room with piles of laundry and a soundtrack of the artist singing to her threeyearold twins motherhood is another central part of andersontempinis show because she regularly feels as if she needs to be in two places at once while raising her young twins you do feel like a wormhole would be really handy she said its that feeling in parenting where you are stretched to your limits and then feel you are being turned inside out the installation in headingley is part of the year of culture in leeds and has been commissioned by artangel the adventurous organisation that takes pride in presenting art in unexpected places whether jeremy dellers battle of orgreave or michael landy destroying everything he owned it is the first artangel commission for its director mariam zulfiqar who succeeded james lingwood and michael morris in zulfiqar said andersontempini produces thought provoking work that is complex

my dad had one weird pocket of chauvinism in an otherwise solid worldview which was that men and women did not and could not like the same films my sister once told him that she couldnt imagine going out with someone with a completely different taste in cinema and he said in that case you are destined to marry someone who lies to keep you happy and there are worse people you could end up married to take out the nonsense gender essentialism indeed gender altogether and films substitute any couple and central heating and im pretty much with him there is no such thing as a couple who wants their house the same temperature and there are definitely couples who lie to keep each other happy i know a guy who pretends not to know how to use the thermostat which strategic incompetence relieves him of the burden of those wars stealthadjusting the temperature until it gets stealthadjusted back then his missus sets the heating to his preference because his cluelessness is just too cute there are couples who interact maturely on the subject with a lot of supplementary chat around thrift vests and windows there are households whose debate is very immature and ends with who could ever live in this heat apart from your mum your mum your mum the beauty of it all is how many other conversations about compromise lifestyle mortality domestic load and everything else get mediated through this very slowburn conversation which starts between late september when the person who wants to be warm enough notices the first cold day and runs until midnovember when the person who is too warm thinks central heating season should begin i think it is roughly what harvest time would have been to a preindustrialised marital unit the release valve via a set of practical cropandpigbased conflicts for

for sandy rensonsmith leaving the picturesque yorkshire cottage she had lived in for years to move miles to be with her adult children in crewe was a much easier decision than it might sound when i discovered my daughter jen was pregnant with her first child i realised i needed to be nearer to them she said weve always been very very close as a family because of me bringing them up on my own added rensonsmith whose husband died in a car accident when her daughter was four and its so lovely being with them obviously i miss my cottage but coming here and being next to the family to me is worth more than its weight in gold now the yearold retired primary school teacher lives in a purposebuilt cottage next door to her daughter and soninlaw kieron both and their daughters romilly four and talia two rensonsmith gets to see her granddaughters every day and takes romilly to and from school she has strictly come dancing takeaway nights with jen and has worked with kieron on transforming the garden from a horses paddock into a cottage garden plus football pitch free childcare and gardening treats from grandma and the chance to see grandchildren flourish day by day no wonder multigenerational living has become aspirational a survey by legal amp general found that nearly half of adults believe it would be a good thing if having three generations in the same household became more popular a third of adults thought the government should give them financial incentives and four in five thought people in multigenerational homes were better off how many people are actually doing it is a different matter the office for national statistics ons does not track the subject regularly but in estimated that the number of households with three generations living together had risen from in to when the ons looked again in it used a different measure and found that there were households that included a person under an over and someone in between people in total after adding in twogeneration homes with parents and their adult children as a study by the cambridge centre for housing and planning research cchpr did in it amounts to about m multigenerational households whether or not that figure is growing is probably down to the uks housing market and the bank of mum and dad people may aspire to coliving but combining two households can be a complicated and expensive business its an interesting part of the changing dynamics in our social and family life said stephen burke the director of united for all ages a social affairs thinktank this is something a lot of families want to do if they can but the big thing is having a property thats suitable big enough to have shared but also private space and not everyone has that luxury thats the biggest thing holding it back some purposebuilt properties exist the architect firm prp designed homes for the chobham manor neighbourhood in queen elizabeth park east london of which were threestorey townhouses with a separate but linked annexe government and local authorities give multigenerational families very little support in terms of public grants or tax incentives burke said whereas if youre interested in becoming a foster carer quite often local authorities might support you to develop a bit of extra space in or on to your home clarion housing group the largest social landlord in the uk has begun a programme called homeshare where older people can offer a spare room to a younger person who can offer practical support but for most people multigenerational living is only really possible for most by owning and adapting existing properties as rensonsmith did jen and kieron bought and converted a barn on the edge of crewe with an acre of land it was easily large enough for an annexe we were going to have a brick building attached to the house but the price of that with no plastering no electricity no plumbing none of that was horrendous said rensonsmith instead they went to one of the few firms specialising in the area ihus who bill themselves as the luxury granny annexe experts the alltimber structures are built in a factory offsite then transported and constructed which makes them substantially cheaper rensonsmiths twobedroom bungalow cost her including planning permission before fixtures and fittings her home is linked to the main house via decking she funded the building work through the sale of her yorkshire cottage and pays a share of the utility bills jen and kieron pay the council tax which is discounted because rensonsmith is disabled the only drawback she could think of was that her post is not delivered separately but through the main house however the annexe is owned by her daughter and soninlaw cchpr studies indicated that most people in multigenerational homes had a very high level of trust in their relatives and didnt introduce any extra legal structures occasionally this can cause problems the researchers spoke to a woman whose husband moved his mother into a granny annexe and later died leaving his wife and mother tied to the same property they did not get on but a clause in his will prevented his wife from dismantling the arrangement no such issues are on the horizon for rensonsmith however im very happy she said i like to help my kids i dont want them to wait till i die before they get something its fine that its in

female drug users are at risk of being groomed into sex work and other forms of exploitation when they attend treatment programmes with men according to new research some women reported feeling vulnerable to predatory males in mixed groups where they were often outnumbered twotoone by men but said they were not given an option to access womenonly treatment programmes one treatment worker compared these groups to a hunting ground for men while others described women being groomed into sex work after being targeted by male drug users according to the new research from the centre for justice innovation and staffordshire university the research which involved indepth interviews with female drug users and workers at drug treatment centres in three local authorities in the west midlands found that women were at risk of being targeted by abusers in services that were chaotic intimidating or unsafe close links between substance misuse and traumatic experiences such as childhood sexual abuse or domestic abuse were identified as making women particularly vulnerable if they were treated alongside men women also experienced a greater burden of stigma around substance use and were more likely to have childcare responsibilities women talked about engaging in sex work as a result of coercion from male drugusing partners the report states they also talked about how women were targeted in mixed services by males who would groom women into sex work activity the research calls for a new specialist approach to treatment for women which keeps them safe while they try to tackle their addiction issues such as sexual violence are particularly difficult for women to raise in the presence of male drug users the report found that barriers to accessing treatment were particularly pronounced for women from some minority communities including women of south asian or eastern european backgrounds to give women the best chance of recovering from addiction drivers of their substance misuse such as trauma and abuse needed to be aired in spaces where they feel safe such as in femaleonly settings the west midlands police and crime commissioner simon foster who cofunded the research along with the jabbs foundation and the nelson trust a charity providing specialist treatment services to women in the southwest of england said overcoming addiction to alcohol or drugs is an immensely difficult challenge and this is made even harder for women who face wider issues which can prevent their ability to engage with treatment services the findings in this research will contribute to the development of more effective and tailored treatment the chief operating officer of the nelson trust christina line said the studys findings in the west midlands precisely mirror the experience of women with substance misuse issues who access our womens centres across the southwest the recommendations show that through a gendered response women can be appropriately supported to successfully complete treatment,2023-10,female drug user risk groomed sex work form exploitation attend treatment programme men according new research woman reported feeling

children were disproportionately affected by pandemic policies with their voices not listened to and no one made responsible by the government for ensuring their legal rights were met the covid inquiry has heard questions about how lockdown policies affected young people werent even asked said the barrister jennifer twite giving evidence on behalf of save the children uk just for kids law and the childrens rights alliance twite said we fear that the answer does not simply lie in the erratic decisionmaking and the failures of mr johnson or the distractions of brexit although we accept those are unlikely to have helped instead young people fell foul of systemic failings she said whose role was it to consider the interests of children and make sure their needs were not forgotten in a crisis twite asked children were at the back of the queue when the government made its biggest decisions about lockdown and reopening the economy said twite prioritisation of venues meant that pubs restaurants and sports clubs were allowed to reopen before schools nurseries and other places for childrens activities the rule where adults were allowed to meet a friend outside meant that younger children who needed supervising were not able to do the same twite said the lack of consideration disproportionately affected children in poverty who were isolated in their homes without adequate replacements for learning food and emotional support this was against the rights of children as enshrined in the united nations convention on the rights of the child twite said she added the charity playing out wrote to the childrens minister and undersecretary of state because they were considerably concerned about the rules about children playing outdoors he wrote back to say that outdoor play was not in his remit because the childrens minister role sits in the department for education we know that gavin williamson the education secretary was so incidental to decisionmaking that it is the current position of this inquiry not even to call him to give evidence in this module so who was there to consider the rights for children in england and perhaps more importantly who should have been the inquiry has said it will embark on a targeted research project to hear from young people twite said the government must appoint a cabinet minister for children with crossdepartmental responsibility for driving forward implementation of a child rights action plan she also called on the government to classify schools and early years settings as essential infrastructure for future

parents to retrain as offspring and what does that entail hanging out eating free food accepting handouts sounds lush where do i sign up in china im willing to travel but thats a bit far slowing growth and a shortage of employment for to yearolds has led to a surge in fulltime children in china although the economic downturn isnt the whole story whats the rest of the story many educated young chinese people are unwilling to put up with low wages punishing hours and unrewarding work so theyve dropped out of the rat race and gone home and their parents let them back in yes chinas onechild policy which ran from to created a generation of parents who regard their children as prized investments not to be undervalued some are even willing to employ their kids as kids giving them a salary to perform household duties well if everybodys happy not everybody is happy in china being a fulltime child is also known by another name kenlao or gnawing on the elderly president xi jinping says the youth of china should learn to eat bitterness sounds as if theyd rather eat home cooking are you sure there are no openings for this position outside china you could always apply to become a boomerang kid whats that an adult child who keeps returning home like a boomerang its similar to being a fulltime child but caused by exorbitant housing costs rather than high unemployment where is that

parenthood is replete with madeleines not just in the cake form when i was struggling to breastfeed and trying to up my milk supply i bought bags and bags of them dipped in chocolate but the famous proustian kind these small encounters with objects or sounds or smells act as nostalgic triggers with the ability to catapult you back to moments in your childhood that you had long forgotten with a surprising emotional force its perhaps less romantic when you discover that proust initially wanted to use toast for his metaphor although actually ive always found toast to be hugely evocative the sight of a schoolboy on a september morning cradling a slice in a sheet of kitchen roll reminded me recently of how my mother along with i suspect mothers everywhere used to thrust toast into my hands as i rushed out of the door late for the bus then this week another madeleine this time in the form of disney more specifically the intro the flag the fireworks the screen panning out to show the pitched turrets of the castle the strings playing when you wish upon a star my god i had forgotten all about it but in a split second i was four again lying on the floor of the living room in our little terraced house in chorlton manchester with the lights out and all the curtains closed and the vhs of the jungle book starting up for the th time that week years of ambivalence towards and at times even discomfort with the disney corporation swept away in one fell swoop compounded by the look of sheer transfixed delight on my childs face as he watched winnie the pooh singing about honey take my money disney take it all disney is of course powered by this kind of adult nostalgia it is part of its modus operandi and central to its profit motive im also aware that disney adults as grownups who really really love disney are termed are widely disdained to the point that they have been called the most hated group on the internet the studio turns this year and has released a short film containing a plethora of characters new and old in celebration many of which i recognised from my own childhood viewing yet it left me fairly cold though i was raised on disney fairytales my mother always made sure that its more saccharine gendered princess output of which i was a faithful acolyte was counterbalanced with feminist alternatives then when i grew up i read from the beast to the blonde and the bloody chamber so im very aware of the disneyfication of traditional fairytales and the gender stereotyping that particularly older disney princess films peddle while recognising that little girls are probably better off watching a sleeping beauty that doesnt contain rape and cannibalism even if she does have a in waist incidentally i was bemused to hear rumours that disney will be adapting bluebeard just how exactly do you manage to put a happy disney filter on that tale of imprisonment and decapitation thats before you get to the racial stereotyping from dumbo to aladdin and song of the south a film so racist that disney has prevented its release on any home video or streaming platform but im old enough to remember zipadeedoodah playing at the end of other features as part of disney singalong im not about to start donning a pair of minnie mouse ears in the queue for the its a small world ride lets put it that way that doesnt mean that im immune though now that i have my own small boy whose face lights up at the sight of christopher robin this is potent stuff and i wont be the last parent willing to overlook their principles because of something that makes their child happy in fact ive been fairly laissezfaire about lots of things you might expect a guardian columnist to get annoyed about from ultraprocessed melty puffs to screen time everyone has their own red lines in parenthood mine happen to be toy guns and kids clothes with slogans on them but disney there has been much improvement in recent years in terms of representation and i genuinely enjoyed watching mary poppins returns at christmas even tearing up about the poor bereaved banks children disney has never shied away from death like many of his generation my father remembers having to be taken traumatised out of bambi one of the questions new parents seem to ask a lot is when does it get easier a friend with a newborn recently said shes looking forward to this and i avoided telling her that i found months even harder than the first bit but another friend reassuringly puts a marker on it it gets easier she says when theyll sit through a whole disney feature and you can go about your business that is of course if you dont spend the whole film mooning over their smile whats working i didnt enjoy the weaning phase i was too sleep deprived and too anxious about choking but one of the things that did make it easier was batchcooking a slowsimmered tomato sauce which i then froze in bulk im still doing it and combined with precooked frozen pasta or this pizza dough recipe its saved me more time than i can quantify whats not we are seeing some signs of toddler tantrums now he doesnt want to sit in his high chair or get out of the swing or go in the bath which can be maddening the thing is i think the baby knows what hes doing theres a page of the book my big shouting day where the little girl rolls around the floor yelling no bed no no no no bed

there are few places in this world more judgmental than the school gate so it was with some horror that i watched our eightyearold excitedly recount a grand parenting disaster in front of a mother i had only just met we were in the delicate business of arranging a first playdate when our youngest suggested we could take her new friend on an adventure like that time we got lost for hours in the bush waded through the river ended up having to climb that steep cliff and got chased by wasps i smiled apologetically the mother smiled nervously and suggested she act as chaperone for the playdate it was only afterwards that i realised my daughter had meant to praise not humiliate me as a school holiday activity that riverside afternoon had felt like a grand parenting failure i had been less intrepid indiana jones and more disastrous dad from the berenstain bears while clambering thirsty and bleeding up a crumbling sandy cliff with two young children shortly before we stumbled on that wasp nest i had visions of how our doomed expedition might be reported in the media the following day and yet months on this trauma had become a treasured memory for our kids more than an amusing anecdote getting lost in the notverywilds of our local suburb had delivered what i had glibly promised an adventure getting lost is no easy matter in an age where we tend to carry the world in our pockets but siris gently chiding instructions were no help when mired in a bamboo thicket or getting snagged while crawling through a fig tree i had been inspired in part by tom hodgkinsons the idle parent the best possibly only guide to parenting i have bothered to read hodgkinson is opposed to the sort of formalised education and play we tend to foist on our kids and advises parents to take children to the wildest and most shopfree spaces they can find it seemed a cheap school holiday option the plan i use the term loosely had been to leave the path and see how far we could make it through a scruffy stretch of green between cliff face and river for the kids it had been an exercise in unpredictability what treasures might await along our winding way we found a graveyard for shopping trolleys abandoned rope swings fossilised roots an overgrown spring and a mysterious gate in a forbidding wall the best part of it for the kids was venturing into the unknown with no clear idea of where we would end up they didnt mind that it took us three hours to get nowhere in particular and having rediscovered civilisation just five minutes to walk back to the car adults can also benefit from not knowing where they are going my most memorable experiences involve getting lost usually while travelling or tipsy or both there are parts of london i would never have discovered if id been better at reading my a to z there are parts of san francisco i would have avoided if id been able to access google on the go there are friends i would never have made if i hadnt got on the wrong bus train or tram getting lost forces us to pay fierce and rewarding attention to our surroundings while trusting in gps encourages us to blindly drive into a lake to allow yourself to get lost which now tends to be a conscious decision rather than a happy accident is to open yourself up to possibility one possibility of course is that you are about to put yourself in danger in a foreign city weve all been there or somewhere kind of near it but it also feels like an act of defiance in our information age a refusal to be led by algorithm or google review every recommendation even those of our close friends tends to be an extension of what we already know or like shunning good advice and getting lost even close to home is a chance to not only chart new territory but to discover an unknown part of ourselves getting lost doesnt have to involve stumbling into danger of course usually the only risk in leaving our comfort zone is abandoning the illusion made so convincing in our digital age that we can or should control every aspect of our lives admittedly this is where the tipsiness can help those of us whose inhibitions have us in a stranglehold there is a certain point of a night out where with a small amount of liquid encouragement it seems suddenly possible to find yourself in a karaoke bar or crashing an irish wedding party these have been some of the best nights of my life as i grow older i find booze has become less necessary to get away from myself instead i try to bottle some of that enthusiasm from the times i had no idea where i was going and soberly remember the joy that often results from embracing the unknown at heart its about play the sort of unpredictable and unstructured play we know children thrive upon one of hodgkinsons arguments along with an appealing antipathy for saturday sports is that bad parents are good parents to be a good parent is to invest in education and extracurricular activities that will we hope allow our offspring to succeed the result is often a childhood that is extensively scheduled particularly when both parents are likely to be working for me that lost afternoon was a reminder that sometimes the best thing we can do for our kids is to plan absolutely nothing and then get lost myke bartlett is a writer and critic,2023-11,place world judgmental school gate wa horror watched eightyearold excitedly recount grand

councils have claimed they are being held to ransom by private care providers as it emerged the taxpayer has been paying as much as a week for single childrens social care placements the extraordinary bill equivalent to m a year for one placement came in new figures from local authorities in england released on wednesday that showed the number of placements for the care of vulnerable children costing over a week has risen to more than equivalent to at least m a year there were only such placements five years ago the councils have provided no further details about the single aweek outlay but the local government association highlighted it as an example of how the market for childrens social care placements is broken the president of the association of directors of childrens services adcs said it demonstrates profiteering local authorities are the sole purchasers of placements yet are often held to ransom by private providers due to lack of sufficiency meaning costs can be thousands of pounds a week for individual placements for children in their care said john pearce the adcss president it cannot be right that the largest independent providers of childrens social care homes made more than m of profit last year every penny of which came directly from the public purse the exorbitant costs being charged by some private social care providers emerged as another major council effectively declared itself bankrupt nottingham city council followed birmingham city council in issuing a formal notice that it cannot balance its budget this year nottingham cited the increased demand for childrens social care as a reason behind its financial peril the latest warning came after the guardian reported last year that one council was charged a week to look after an autistic teenager with a mild learning disability she had a history of violence and was looked after by six dedicated carers the lga is now calling for urgent funding for childrens social care in the upcoming provisional local government finance settlement it warned the lack of investment in the chancellors autumn statement risked councils ability to provide the critical care and support that children rely on every day the astronomical costs of care placements mean there is less money available for councils to spend on earlier support for children and families said cllr louise gittins

thought it meant that if you rip all of someones hair out then they die i try to keep the kids really do say the darnedest things parts of parenting to a minimum in this column but this did make us laugh out loud i suppose its because my sons literacy is coming along so fast i sometimes forget he is five and still figuring out how the world works such is the quandary faced by anyone trying to

others she pronounces with innocent delight star cat tree dog as she points at things in my sons case we have this same effect on a slightly higher setting he was an early reader and has now proven literate to the point of prodigiousness please dont misunderstand i am bragging about his reading ability in the hope that it reflects well on me but it does have its drawbacks he reads his own books from school but finds them boring and pushes himself to read more challenging read violent and gross texts for his own bedtimes this was of course only a hop skip and a jump to him surreptitiously reading books messages and on one occasion an issue of viz over my shoulder and reciting the anglosaxon phrasing he found therein like a newsagent weve learned to keep less suitable material in higher places and he exercises by reading books to his sister which he finds adorable until she makes him read their thick cardboard pages over and over again which he does not mostly however there is the wonder and curiosity of someone with a new skill desperate to sharpen it at will unfortunately i dont have all the answers and this sometimes reveals more about me than him what does mot mean he asks as we passed a garage i did not at that time know that it stood for ministry of transport so in a moment of weakness i hesitate while he learns about the world and words around him im learning that there are many words i see every day that ive never asked about myself and moreover that i am too much of an intellectual fraud to admit this to a fiveyearold boy umm it means motorvehicle uh operations test it would be nice to tell you ive corrected myself since but i have not i can only hope he asks again insecure yearold men i tell myself we really do say the darnedest things did ye

the head of a childcare company backed by the prime ministers wife has attacked the government following the autumn statement accusing ministers of letting nurseries go bust rachel carrell the chief executive of koru kids criticised a failure to allocate extra money for the childcare sector despite many providers saying that they could go out of business under changes brought in earlier this year jeremy hunt announced at the budget in march that he would allow more parents to benefit from free hours of childcare extending the offer to children aged nine months and over the chancellor allocated bn to pay for the expanded offer but many providers have said this will not be enough to prevent them going bankrupt carrell said on wednesday the childcare sector is in complete disarray with nurseries going under childminder numbers plummeting and parents facing enormous bills and waiting lists given this it beggars belief that a growth budget did not have anything at all for childcare its as if they do not connect the issue of childcare with economic growth at all even though clearly childcare underpins parents ability to work koru kids a childminding agency benefited in the budget from a pilot scheme that offered for anyone who decided to train as a childminder through such an agency the companys links with the government came under scrutiny following that announcement as rishi sunak had failed to disclose on the public register of ministerial interests that his wife akshata murty was a shareholder she is understood still to be invested in koru kids murtys investment has not been enough to shield the government from criticism on this occasion however as carrell joined the growing ranks of experts warning about the risks of not allocating more money to childcare providers sarah ronan the director of the early education and childcare coalition said ministers should significantly increase the rates they pay to providers to offer free childcare places failing to do that is placing providers in a perilous financial position and is likely to lead to more closures at a time when the government should be shoring up the sector she said joeli brearley the chief executive of the campaign group pregnant then screwed pointed out that hunt had spent money on tax breaks for pubs but none on childcare the irony of an autumn statement on equal pay day which prioritises pints

richer families in england are almost six times as likely to benefit from the governments childcare expansion as lowincome families research has revealed experts have warned that poorer children will be denied access to early years education because their parents do not meet the governments eligibility criteria which states that both parents must work at least hours a week a new report argues that children of lowincome households where one or both parents do not work because of issues including ill health caring responsibilities or lack of job opportunity or security would benefit most from childcare but are being shut out from it which will exacerbate existing inequality researchers estimate as many as million children could be left out of the expansion because of their parents working situation the new economics foundation thinktank found that only of poorer families will have access to the full hours free childcare scheme from september compared with of families in the top of earners in england some lowincome families receiving benefits can currently get hours a week of childcare in term time when their child turns two and all three and fouryearolds can get hours of childcare regardless of the income or working status of their parent or carer and hours if they meet the work criteria the government is expanding the hours of free childcare scheme to all eligible children of working parents aged between nine months and two years by september lee elliot major a professor of social mobility at the university of exeter said the governments childcare plan was a missed opportunity to provide highquality educational support for underresourced children the fear is that this will only exacerbate stark education divides during the early years making it even harder for schools to tackle inequalities from the moment children enter the classroom he said the head of social policy at the new economics foundation and lead author of the study tom pollard said the government was prioritising parents working status over childrens needs resulting in children from lowincome households being denied access to vital early years education making childcare accessible for everyone would improve the life chances of lowincome children and in the process create widespread economic benefits including jobs in the poorer areas of the country he said the study a fair start for all a universal basic services approach to early education and care also found that lowincome families would struggle to find a place even if they received the full free hours offer because of lower provision in the more deprived areas in england increasing the number of places across the country to match the levels of the bestserved local authorities would create up to jobs according to the research children from lowincome families stand to benefit most from early years provision but they dont have equal access to it and the education they receive is more likely to be of lower quality said sir peter lampl the founder of the sutton trust and the education endowment foundation by the time they reach school they are well behind their betteroff peers he said treating early years education just as childcare is storing up problems for the future and putting a brake on social mobility the research by the new economics foundation also found that investing in childcare for poorer children could have positive economic benefits for the treasury for every pound the government borrows and invests into early years education for poorer children researchers estimate the treasury would receive back in tax revenue over the course of their lifetime as opposed to from investing in middleincome families and a loss of p when investing in highincome households experts are warning that the governments planned childcare expansion is undeliverable with anxious nursery managers saying they may offer a limited number of funded places and that a mass exodus of childminders and nursery staff risks undermining the expansion a report published recently by the early education and childcare coalition calculated the sector could need up to new workers if those intending to leave the profession within one year went through with their plan a department for education spokesperson said it was providing targeted support for the early years sector including training qualifications and an online child development course a spokesperson said this government is rolling out the single biggest investment in childcare in englands history and we are confident in the

the babys progress is the main event when nana and grandad arrive in the few months since they last saw her shes started walking and even after a fashion talking they marvel at all the progress weve lost sight of through close observation when it comes to walking shes steady on her feet and growing more comfortable in shoes or should i say schuuus since this is how she refers to her foot coverings oh someway north of times a day this one word comprises a sizeable percentage of her vocabulary which now stretches to about a dozen words in truth shes merely become competent at syllables cats are cuh dogs duh etc but the real showstopper is her contribution to my rendition of twinkle twinkle little star i get her started by singing twinkle twinkle little to which she adds a delighted sta at the end i chime back in with how i wonder what you and she applies a tense foursecond pause before uttering a euphoric and almost inaudible ah in response it might not amount to freeflowing speech but its still impressive and we cheer accordingly if nothing else her growing aptitude for call and response verbiage would make her an excellent member of the beastie boys our daughter has a twoweek break from childcare and grandad and nana have come over to provide invaluable in fact miraculous help minding her while we work as with any time sean and marian visit they prove so bafflingly dutifully helpful i feel mildly guilty for their entire stay when not minding our monthold they clean our house until every surface proffers a reflection cupboards are reorganised and the fridge deloused pots we barely recognise are presented to us from the back ends of cupboards we have avoided for years then either sterilised or binned with the ruthless efficiency mort typical of a swiss

havent worn since brexit outdoors too we are shamed by their efforts sean an avid gardener did a beautiful job last time he was here and i did try to keep it up by this i mean ive done precisely one bit of gardening since then and it resulted in flames coming out of our electric lawnmower he helps us replace this even assuring me unconvincingly that it was a fault with the model and tackles the garden with more grace than we deserve its weeds routed its flowers enlivened in short they tackle so many of our longgestating chores its as if we are a pair of wellloved local slobs whose neighbours have reached out to a daytime tv show to help us get our lives in order we repay them in dinners and egregious repetitions of gratitude but it doesnt seem enough my wife says a true show of gratitude would be to pay it forward and commit to doing the same for our own kids when the time comes i ponder this for a moment consider my existing skills and shudder or i can write them an article or

childcare costs in the uk are the most expensive of any developed country but almost twothirds of families do not claim the government money to which they are entitled it is estimated that million families are eligible for up to a year per child or for those with disabled children through the taxfree childcare tfc scheme under which the government will add to every you pay your childcare provider but just or families claimed in june according to the latest data from hm revenue and customs hmrc the number of families that claim is rising consistently the government paid out m more in june compared with last year but there is still a huge shortfall in those who could to be eligible for the each parent or carer must be earning at least the minimum wage and not more than and working hours a week or more so why arent more families taking advantage of this scheme stagnant funding the amount of money available from government has remained the same since despite spiralling childcare costs the average parttime bill for a child under two is a week or a year a rise of on last year according to the childrens charity coram yet many families pay more as these figures are only for hours of care a week louisa dunbar from reading has two children isabelle six and william two she and her husband stephen have spent an estimated on fulltime childcare since they started a family she says that as a small business owner she was left with the choice of giving up the company or paying for childcare the family is eligible for tfc but louisa describes the system as incredibly admin heavy and the help we get is barely noticeable our fees for nursery and childcare have increased multiple times in the last few years she says i can see how some people can miss out on these benefits the system isnt very accessible which means it discriminates against those who need it most she adds that it doesnt make one bit of sense that the money available hasnt changed during the cost of living crisis another common complaint is the level of bureaucracy involved including the fact parents need to reconfirm their details every three months sarah ronan acting director of the early education and childcare coalition says some people argue that the scheme is intentionally designed to be difficult every year we see the same perennial marketing campaign and every year uptake remains low she says the reality is the taxfree childcare scheme does not meet the needs of most families its clunky and the amount parents get back doesnt get close to meeting the high costs of fees poor awareness many people are simply unaware they are eligible research from campaign group pregnant then screwed says one in seven parents do not know about it the groups founder joeli brearley says you could argue that you need a degree and a parttime job just to undertake the onerous application process the title of the scheme is really misleading with the benefit capped at a quarter and with childcare costs exceeding on average a year fulltime it is not tax free at all and it hasnt increased since it was first implemented in despite childcare costs increasing by in that time hannah hardman from kent who has two children harper two and hugo one didnt realise she was eligible for the money the additional would have taken the pressure off especially as when i returned to work i was navigating new expenses with depleted savings from topping up statutory maternity pay she says with a childcare bill of more than a year for her two children for three and a half days she works a condensed week and has fridays off to avoid an even greater bill it would be great if eligible families could be autoenrolled to avoid so many missing out on the funding she says who controls it tfc is looked after by two government departments hmrc and the treasury hmrc says the need for parents to reconfirm their eligibility every three months represents a fair compromise between imposing onerous frequent reconfirmations and giving government support to parents that are not eligible the treasury says of the level of funding that the government believes it strikes the right balance between helping parents with their childcare costs and managing the public finances in a responsible way tfc is one of several schemes for childcare fees another provides free hours of care which applies to most children when they are three this system under the current government is set for a massive overhaul announced in march which will see the eligibility age lowered to nine months from september how to claim if you are eligible for tfc you can sign up for an account at the govuk website you can then add money directly into the account which is used to pay the childcare provider the money deposited into the account is topped up to the annual limit payments to your childcare provider need to be set up you must use an approved childcare provider and you will need to reconfirm your details every

remember thursday nights and the applause for key workers on doorsteps during the pandemic people working in demanding publicfacing jobs were rightly and warmly acclaimed that was then these days staff shortages are causing problems across public services above all in careers demanding high levels of personal interaction including teaching prisons and probation early years is the latest sector to declare that a lack of staff threatens its capacity to meet families needs according to research by the early education and childcare coalition just of nursery managers believe they will be able to offer the free hours promised by ministers from next year about people in england have left jobs in nurseries or as childminders since representing a fall availability is particularly low in places where poorer people live nearly a third of notforprofit nurseries in these areas closed down or were privatised between and with around twothirds of all places now privately run including many that are publicly funded there are warnings that nurseries risk becoming a playground for private equity the track record of such owners in care homes and elsewhere makes this highly undesirable in particular experts are concerned about children with special educational needs and ownership and governance structures that lack transparency the low pay and status of childcare work the vast majority of which is done by women has long been recognised as unfair given the responsibilities involved for childminders who work from home rising energy and other costs pose particular difficulties but the departure of many older and experienced workers can also be seen as part of a wider labourmarket problem years of publicsector pay freezes followed by belowinflation rises are part of the reason junior doctors were in talks with ministers last month but their dispute remains unresolved teachers accepted a rise in the summer but recruitment difficulties continue with half of this years secondary trainee places unfilled another factor is job cuts during the austerity years that led many senior workers to quit leaving new recruits without suitable mentors and teams without experienced members in prisons policing and social work it is increasingly recognised that the loss of institutional memory and knowhow causes lasting harm the pandemic raised hopes that the emotional and physical toll of publicfacing roles would gain broader recognition but covids legacy has been harsh with hybrid flexible and online working the new normal for many workers those in frontline jobs are more than ever conscious of the risks and demands including antisocial hours and physical contact with others that their work involves the institute for government has warned that some services could become stuck in a doom loop with the public increasingly frustrated by inadequate provision and people increasingly unwilling to work in such conditions some creative solutions to these interlinked problems have been proposed labour is looking at forgiving the student debt of newly qualified nhs doctors and nurses new visas for care workers were due to be followed by workplace reforms though

domestic abuse victims are being reported to immigration officials when they turn to the police for help according to data published by an independent watchdog the police forces in england and wales and the british transport police have all referred victims or survivors of abuse to immigration enforcement in the last three years prompting urgent calls for reform of the system the threat of being reported to the home office is often used by the perpetrators of domestic abuse to control their victims according to the domestic violence commissioner nicole jacobs one of those targeted by david carrick the metropolitan police officer who was jailed for life after admitting to serious offences during a year campaign of attacks against women said he had threatened her with deportation jacobs said the practice of reporting victims to immigration enforcement stopped people from coming forward and allowed perpetrators to evade justice she said at the point when victims have come to the police for safety from abuse they are met with what many fear most contact with immigration enforcement migrant victims have told me that this plays into the perpetrators tactics of control this data shows there is not a single police force where migrant victims are treated as victims first and foremost this must change now only with the introduction of a firewall can the victims and prisoners bill ensure justice and protection for all not just some victims jacobs has written to the home secretary suella braverman calling for a firewall to stop police and other services from reporting complainants to immigration enforcement police made referrals to the home office for immigration investigation in relation to victims and survivors reporting domestic abuse from april to march according to the figures obtained by the commissioner from the home office according to a report published by the commissioner police officers called immigration enforcement in front of one victim when she reported her expartner the report says this was the first time lucia sought support from the police after three years of being in an abusive relationship she felt let down by the police and fearful of removal from the country as a consequence of having reported the crime the perpetrator continued to harass and threaten her lucia contacted her caseworker extremely distressed saying she did not want to have any contact with the police as abuse escalated again her caseworker tried to convince her to make another report which lucia opposed as she was more afraid of deportation eight days after the police report lucia got an immigration enforcement letter the immigration enforcement letter led the woman to withdraw from domestic abuse support the commissioner found that no enforcement action such as detention or removal was made in the three years to march jacobs said that no immigration enforcement action was taken against victims shows us that this practice is serving no one but the fear it instils creates a high cost to the safety of victims and the public the national police chiefs council npcc guidance to forces says they may share basic information including an address with immigration enforcement if they suspect a victim or witness may not be legally residing in the uk the npcc said however that officers did not routinely investigate victims migration status jacobs said she wanted the government to amend the victims and prisoners bill when it returns to parliament in autumn this year imkaan a charity that focuses on addressing violence against

dean martins threeyearold son only started at nursery in september but has settled in almost immediately that is not surprising when you hear the phrase his father uses to describes the staff at the maintained nursery in croydon child whisperers theyre brilliant highly qualified and absolutely fantastic with kids says martin who is and an ecologist theyre not in it for the money they love to help young children flourish so like many parents of young children in croydon martin was devastated to learn last month that the council had launched a consultation to reduce the number of maintained nurseries in the london borough almost a third of nurseries run by notforprofit organisations have shut their doors in the poorest areas of england a guardian analysis of childcare providers in england has revealed the figures come against a backdrop of experts saying the childcare sector risks becoming a playground for private equity with investment funds more than doubling their stake in the sector within a period of four years meanwhile the governments plan to massively expand its free childcare provision has been labelled undeliverable by the sector as hundreds of nurseries across england surveyed this summer said it would lead to a chronic shortage of places and parents having to pay parents told the guardian about their struggles to find places for their children as nurseries shut amid funding shortfalls and staff shortages if his sons nursery were to shut martin who is selfemployed says he would have to cut his working hours in order to care for him alongside arranging provision from a childminder he wants to avoid the private nursery route as he felt his older son who is now seven and is autistic was not well supported private firms charge higher prices with less qualified staff research from university college london shows ive experienced major anxiety over the consultation its hugely stressful not knowing how long we will have childcare for says martin he emphasises that his family is in a relatively lucky position compared with others in the area a closure would make life difficult for us but we could just about afford an alternative until our boy goes to reception other families definitely couldnt its about the community we want to live in as well our boy was a covid baby he missed out very young we want to live in a community where people can flourish where we look after them in those early years for solo parents being left without a nursery cuts even deeper after the private nursery jen rush was sending her threeyearold daughter to shut in august the family is planning to move away from llangollen north wales where rush has lived for eight years in search of better early years provision her husband died last summer and rush had been preparing to return to work but a lack of robust childcare has complicated the transition as the only parent i cant afford to work anything less than fulltime she says explaining that she has struggled to find provision close by with one nursery she would consider involving a twohour round trip daily while another provider had no availability ultimately i have decided to sell up and relocate from a town i love and the place i built a home with my late husband reliable fulltime childcare is imperative for me and i will now be moving based on the availability of this rush who is a marketing and communications professional is having her house valued and is looking into a local playgroup as a stopgap while she applies for jobs and freelance work she describes the catch around work and the childcare crisis a vicious cycle familiar to many women and particularly single parents right now hours weekly in a playgroup is the most i can afford as a solo parent with no family in the area it just cant function i cant work enough hours to support her on my own theres no infrastructure in the town any more for me to cope some people manage to negotiate their hours with work because theyre in a couple but when youre on your own theres no one else you can mitigate it with her daughter has struggled with losing the stability and comfort her nursery offered my daughter is only three and learning to cope with the loss of her dad she now has to come to terms with the loss of a nursery and contact with the staff she loved and who provided a great deal of stability during her dads illness decline and death it was a bit like another loss for her for jess fleetwood in yeovil her twoyearolds nursery closure at the end of september meant she and her husband have had to adjust their working hours resulting in lost income fleetwood has found another private nursery to take her daughter but it has not been easy i cant tell you how many we called around she says we got lucky there was one with enough space although the couple are happy with the new nursery it is further away and has come at an additional financial hit of about a month that is partly due to the fees and hours but also because the different timetable means fleetwoods husband an engineer is missing out on a couple hundred in overtime payments every month in order to pick up his daughter it is important to fleetwood who works parttime for a charity that she continues to work alongside raising her two daughters for my mental health i want to be a working mum and for them to see their mum and dad both going to work she says explaining that her employer has been supportive its worthwhile even if we only have a couple hundred pounds left over after paying the nursery bill,2023-11,dean martin

poorer families are being locked out of a big expansion in free nursery hours experts have warned as exclusive guardian analysis reveals that the number of notforprofit nurseries in englands mostdeprived areas has fallen sharply close to a third of notforprofit nurseries closed their doors or were taken over by private companies including private equity firms in the poorest parts of the country from according to analysis of official figures experts warn that staterun and notforprofit nurseries play a vital role in caring for children with special education needs and cater to the uks poorest families the warnings come before the governments planned expansion of free childcare schemes starting from april which experts this week said was undeliverable unless a staffing crisis was reversed from april eligible working parents of twoyearolds will get hours a week of taxpayerfunded childcare for weeks of the year and from september all eligible parents of children under the age of five will be able to get funding for hours a week of childcare for weeks of the year earlier this year experts warned childcare could become a playground for private equity with investment funds more than doubling their stake in the sector in four years there are warning signs that this will lead to more nonprofit nurseries closing their doors and leave the poorest families and families of children with special educational needs living in childcare deserts said joeli brearley founder of the campaign group pregnant then screwed as childcare becomes a new arm of the welfare state with billions being pumped into it by the taxpayer it is imperative that every penny addresses the quality and availability of provision rather than lining the pockets of big business she said the guardian analysed more than childcare providers and found that the number run by charities councils churches and other notforprofit organisations had fallen sharply in four years close to a third of notforprofit nurseries closed or were privatised in the most deprived parts of england between and the number of notforprofit childcare places reduced by compared with a drop in the number of underfives living in those areas across england nurseries run by notforprofits have dropped by in four years while those run by private companies increased by on the whole disadvantaged children fare better in notforprofit or state nursery care settings but these centres are dwindling said abby jitendra policy adviser at the joseph rowntree foundation this is because the government has higher standards for notforprofits than their counterparts when the priority should be making sure every child has access to quality care no matter where they live sir peter lampl founder and chairman of the sutton trust said poorer families were already locked out of current help with the costs of childcare research from the organisation showed that only of the bottom third of earners were eligible for help for three to fouryearolds which requires parents to work for at least hours a week he added that nurseries were closing in poorer areas because the hourly rate for free hours paid to providers by the government was not enough to cover costs while there was less scope to make up the shortfall through extra charges to parents early years provision should be seen as education not just childcare and all young children should have access to it he said a recent study by university college london found there was a lack of explicit reference to care for vulnerable or disadvantaged children in the private sector which focuses on profitability and expansion and is dominated by complex financial structures and risky operational models dr antonia simon lead author of the report said strong safeguards were needed for companies that receive taxpayers money as the treasury plans to spend an extra bn a year to fund nursery places can childcare run by profitmaking companies whose ethos is to deliver profits to shareholders deliver equal and fair outcomes for all children she asked we need robust safeguards for childcare companies receiving public money including meeting the needs of vulnerable children and locating equally in deprived and nondeprived areas purnima tanuku chief executive of the national day nurseries association said nurseries in deprived areas were more likely to close because they have a higher proportion of governmentfunded children to parentpaid children the government has increased the funding rate but campaigners are saying it is not enough to cover the providers costs between and the number of childcare providers fell by in the most deprived areas in england with a reduction in available places in the same period the least deprived areas saw a drop in the number of nurseries but a increase in the number of places high quality early education and care plays an essential role in childrens future especially for those living in deprived areas who are more likely to have special needs as it can help close the attainment gap which widens during their school years said tanuku the department for education said the government was rolling out the single biggest investment in childcare in englands history to make sure there are enough places across the country we are already investing hundreds of millions of pounds to increase hourly funding rates and will shortly be allocating m in capital funding for more early years and wrapround places and spaces,2023-11,poorer family locked big expansion free nursery hour expert warned exclusive

a mass exodus of childminders and nursery staff risks scuppering the governments flagship new funding for parents of young children in england according to a new coalition of early years providers and campaigners more than half of all nursery workers surveyed by the early education and childcare coalition eecc said they were considering or planning on leaving the sector in the next months in the spring budget the chancellor jeremy hunt announced plans to massively extend the governments offer of hours of free childcare to children aged between nine months and two years by billing it as the single biggest investment in childcare in england but the eecc said there are likely to be a lot of disappointed parents if staffing means places are undeliverable the report retention and return delivering the expansion of early years entitlement in england estimates that about extra children will enter childcare settings by at the same time as large numbers of staff say they are planning to leave because of low pay lack of career progression and increased workload the first tranche of free hours hours of childcare for eligible working parents of twoyearolds is due to start in april next year it pains me to say it but i think theres going to be a lot of disappointed parents said sarah ronan the acting director of the eecc just because the chancellor says you get free hours like oprah handing out free cars it doesnt make it a reality what makes it a reality is having the infrastructure and a welltrained qualified wellpaid workforce in place the report found that only of nursery managers said they could offer the extended free hours entitlement because of the recruitment crisis while said they would limit the number of places they offered unless the government helped with recruitment the situation is more acute for nurseries offering provision for children with special education needs and disabilities send said the eecc with of nursery respondents and of childminders saying they were working with more children with send often without the right support for the child other workers reported an increase in workload which they said was exacerbated by the recent relaxation of staffing ratios for twoyearolds from to years of underfunding have left the early years workforce underpaid overworked and feeling disrespected said ronan a freedom of information request by the early years alliance revealed in that the government had knowingly underfunded free hours over the past decade from september funding rates per child will increase from an average of to for three to fouryearolds and from an average of to for twoyearolds the womens budget group argues that a rate of an hour for three to fouryearolds is required to cover costs a spokesperson for the department for education said its data indicated a stable workforce but we know there is more to do which is why we are launching a new national recruitment campaign in the new year and an accelerated apprenticeship route into the sector to help recruit new staff they said to support existing staff we are investing hundreds of millions of pounds to increase rates paid for governmentfunded hours and

arranging childcare can feel like trying to solve a piece jigsaw puzzle only half the pieces are missing and the others keep changing shape multiple work patterns have to be negotiated and mapped out for the lucky few grandparents may be gently coerced or even strongarmed into offering a helping hand then there is the eyewatering cost which in the uk is among the highest of leading economies according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development once parents have cleared these hurdles there is still the small matter of actually finding provision whether it is with a childminder nursery or private nanny for the most coveted nurseries demand is high with some children added to waiting lists soon after the moment of conception fewer than half of local authority areas report having enough childcare to cover the needs of parents working fulltime if your head is hurting with the effort of calculating the cost of childcare then help is at hand with this interactive we assume your baby started nursery in september when they were months old as they progress through life your child will benefit from some of the new childcare cost help that the government announced earlier this year lets begin how many hours of childcare do you need a week having an undertwo at nursery fulltime costs close to a week according to data from the department for education childminders are a cheaper option costing on average less than nurseries prices depend on where you live with the london boroughs of hammersmith and fulham and kensington and chelsea the most expensive areas a week in the capital costs more than a week in yorkshire and the humber how much might your childcare cost an hour your baby is now months old potentially crawling around your home and merrily finding new hazardous situations as well as switching off every plug and installing baby safety locks in all low drawers you are close to receiving your first nursery bill but while childcare costs are undeniably high the real problem is affordability in other words the proportion of your salary that goes to pay the bill if you receive universal credit tax credit or any other benefit please enter the details below if you receive no benefits simply enter your household income this information will not be saved or stored by the guardian the governments plan to expand the free childcare schemes may alleviate some of the burden from parents once fully introduced in september but experts argue that with no workforce plan in place it will increase pressure on nurseries who will be unable to cope with demand providers have long complained that the system is underfunded with hundreds of nurseries recently saying that the governments extension is undeliverable and that it would lead to a shortage of places the government has increased hourly funding rates but campaigners argue it is still not enough a survey of providers by the early years alliance shows that most settings are not planning to increase their capacity under the new government scheme while many of them plan to offer a limited number of places childcare providers have traditionally used the fees from younger children to cover the gap between the funding they receive from the free schemes and their real costs with the expansion of these schemes to the youngest children they argue that their margins to make services viable will be reduced another survey by the department for education in november showed that one in providers responded that they were likely to close owing to cost pressures while half said the income was not sufficient to cover costs the issue of taxfree childcare a government tax break for working parents that can be used to reduce afterschool club and holiday club bills until a child is is also a bugbear for childcare reformers at the end of treasury figures showed that the government spent less than budgeted on taxfree childcare every year since it was introduced in underspending bn between and antipoverty campaigners also warn that limiting the reform to working parents excludes the poorest children who would benefit the most from highquality early years education according to the sutton trust of those eligible for the current free hours are in the top half of earners and are in the bottom third of the income distribution charities and academics have also warned that hundreds of thousands of parents who rely on universal credit most of them women will be negatively affected by the government plans especially when the child turns three driving some families into debts the head of coram family and childcare megan jarvie said parents had struggled with high and rising costs for many years meaning that many are locked out of work or struggle to make ends meet even if parents can afford the cost of childcare gaps in availability mean some families are not able to find the childcare they need highquality childcare is key social infrastructure it helps parents work and narrows the gap between poorer children and their more affluent peers we need to see complete reform of the childcare system so that it meets the needs of all families neil leitch the chief executiveof the early years alliance said the governments hour expansion put pressure on providers to deliver even more places at a time when the infrastructure simply isnt there to deliver them he added that if providers limit the number of funded places they offer families will struggle to benefit from the new scheme it is absolutely vital therefore that the government works with the sector to ensure that settings are wellequipped sufficiently staffed and crucially adequately funded to deliver both the existing and new offers anything less is a recipe for disaster a department for education spokesperson said the government was delivering its single biggest investment in childcare in england ever including an increase of the funding rate recruitment campaigns and improving qualification routes into the sector the expansion of hours of free childcare will save eligible working parents up to an average of per year by we expect to be spending bn in total every year to support parents with flexible and affordable childcare and give children the best quality early years education families with children under living in the uk can also apply for child benefit to cover any cost but parents on higher salaries may be affected by the high income child benefit charge and there is a twochild benefit cap that prevents parents from claiming benefit

family the median gross annual pay is taken from the office of national statistics although users are invited to enter their net monthly income the gross salary is used if they select a regional average due to data availability to calculate childcare benefits we assume both parents are over years old they are not receiving any other benefit or have a child with disabilities or have a disability themselves and they are both working we also assume they are registered with an approved childcare provider in england the governments and hours free childcare are evenly distributed across the year and the total of and free hours available are stretched over the weeks free childcare entitlements are also flexible and parents can access hours in a day with no additional cost this piece assumes the benefits are applied the month the child turns a year older and topup fees are introduced since the child is eligible for hours of free childcare prices change over time according to an analysis of government figures and the cost of the free childcare schemes are based on the new government funding rate using the national average data a family might be entitled to receive universal credit tax credits or other types of benefits when they have their second child but this project does not account for this as we cannot assess if users are eligible for every type of benefit owing to

my wife is smiling were on the final stretch to my dads house on our midterm break in derry and i cant resist pointing out places of interest thats where the tillie amp henderson factory used to be i say im just about to tell her that it was mentioned in das kapital but she says it first while rolling her eyes shes been coming here with me for years and i have a habit of repeating myself worse since the first years of these visits involved my dad driving us around and telling these exact same things i am repeating himself becoming your own father is something most men grapple with when they talk to their kids id simply prefer not to do so with my own wife i purse my lips and resist the urge to indicate where the old checkpoint used to be at nixons corner we are home for four short days but luckily we have some slightly more novel sightseeing planned my wife recently told me shed never visited the giants causeway a geological marvel on the north antrim coast comprising interlocking hexagonal basalt columns shes adamant that we make the trip and i say this sounds like a great idea but i wonder if it will live up to her expectations will it be like wagon wheels or seaside amusements one of those things that seemed big when i was small but seem small now im big my father is less subtle when she tells him of her intentions he looks at her as if shes announced shes joining a cult he narrows his eyes and in that low voice of concern he uses any time he suspects his awful son has led his incorrigible wife astray tells her its an hour away before adding you do know its just a heap of stones dont ye basically hes right its just that it also happens to be a very beautiful heap of scientifically fascinating and culturally important stones and we arrive full of excitement im impressed with the visitors centre a basaltgrey polyhedron that blends in with the surrounding environment its sleek futuristic and slightly ominous like the lair of a tech billionaire hoping to escape the effects of the climate apocalypse my daughter enjoys its interior for its large openplan layout and exercises her newly walking legs by covering every inch of it my son who it turns out knows this world heritage site from its appearance on an episode of go jetters races around inhaling all the facts he can he plays with a machine that simulates the movement of molten rock and operates a touch screen that takes him back in time m years and then we make the trip down the coastal route to the causeway itself and my wife is in raptures far from being the small strip of my imagination it is vast and gleams in a shaft of sunlight as if the weather is being directly controlled by the northern ireland tourist board the original bushmills distillery is just up the coast

out of control increases in child protection spending since the outbreak of the covid pandemic have put one in of englands biggest councils at risk of effective bankruptcy in the next few months a survey has revealed many county councils and unitary authorities are running out of road to avoid insolvency as they grapple with high inflation increases in children being taken into care and massive bills for childrens homes the county councils network ccn said the chancellor jeremy hunt is under increasing pressure to announce more funds for councils at this months autumn statement amid rising concern about the financial viability of local authority services despite drastic cuts in recent years the ccn called for an injection of emergency funding for childrens services where costs were spiralling out of control without urgent help councils will be forced to make drastic cuts to other services and drain reserves to unsustainable levels to meet core child protection duties in the last few months hampshire which said it was facing financial meltdown somerset and west berkshire have all publicly disclosed they may fail to meet the legal duty to balance their books over the next months and be forced to issue a section notice in effect bankruptcy although recent section notices in croydon thurrock and birmingham have been triggered by risky commercial deals turning sour and poor governance the ccn said the underlying financial weakness of local government finances after a decade of cuts meant even wellmanaged authorities now faced insolvency smaller district councils have separately said they could face bankruptcy as a result of a rapid increase in homelessness while metropolitan boroughs are also struggling to balance the books total deficits across all english councils amount to bn over the next months according to the local government association for the counties and unitary authorities in england that took part in the survey childrens services accounted for more than half of the total overspend followed by adult social care and hometoschool transport services total projected overspends for all ccn member services this year are projected to hit m the ccn pointed to a sharp increase in postpandemic demand for childrens services the soaring cost of care placements because of inflation and a broken provider market dominated by highly profitable private firms charging more than a week in some cases for highly specialist childrens residential placements there have been more than extra child protection referrals in county areas since the pandemic putting added pressure on childrens services with over more children entering local authority care as a result the ccn added barry lewis the ccns vicechair and finance spokesperson said this

funding black hole the majority of the m of additional and unexpected spending this year are simply outside of councils control the number of vulnerable children requiring care has risen dramatically postpandemic while inflation and a broken provider market in statutory care placements mean councils face no choice but to pay spiralling fees a spokesperson for the department for levelling up housing and communities said we continue to monitor pressures on all councils and we stand ready to talk to any council that is concerned about its financial position councils are ultimately

abusive men in england and wales will walk free from court under a new sentencing policy that flies in the face of ministers claims to take domestic violence seriously an independent government watchdog has said nicole jacobs the domestic abuse commissioner said ministers had not done enough to protect women from a decision to lift the pressures on overcrowded prisons by scrapping short prison sentences the governments sentencing bill puts a duty on judges to give suspended sentences where they may otherwise have given jail terms of months or less after advocacy groups raised concerns an exemption was added in november in cases where convicted individuals had breached a court order or could be shown to pose a significant risk of causing psychological or physical harm to another person speaking to the guardian jacobs said this was inadequate and that the governments failure to respond to her call for a specific exemption for perpetrators of domestic abuse was putting women at risk she claimed the probation service did not have the capacity to properly advise judges and magistrates on the dangers posed by perpetrators of domestic violence a recent recruitment drive for probation officers has increased numbers by year on year however the service was lacking experience jacobs said and the rehabilitation on offer to abusive men within the community was operating at full capacity she said it was unacceptable that the minority of women who felt able to cooperate with an investigation all the way to conviction should be left exposed by the system last year of domestic abuse reports resulted in a charge for sexual offences flagged as domestic abuse the charge rate was even lower at jacobs said its not that i think that prison is the best idea for everyone but it is not the case that someone who is in for a kind of lowlevel sentence is not a very dangerous person to the victim what it has taken to get the victim to a point where that has actually happened most of the time that will be relying on a statement by the victim you know four out of five wont ever report domestic abuse to the police so when you take the one out of five who report to the police and then you get to a fraction of them who actually get to the court and if at that stage the court says oh well give you a community sentence that really just flies in the face of this kind of rhetoric by the government that domestic abuse is serious that it is as serious as terrorism organised crime that is such a mismatch according to the latest ministry of justice statistics men were jailed for about months or less for harassment stalking and revenge porn last year there are concerns that a proportion of this number would not be imprisoned in the future jacobs said she had met the justice secretary alex chalk to make the point that a judge who wished to hand down a prison sentence to such men would be heavily reliant on the probation services to correctly identify the level of risk of a perpetrator causing psychological or physical harm a full probation report is what it would take to have any confidence that the judge would be able to do that correctly she said she added that for those given community service sentences probation did have some rehabilitative perpetrator programmes but they are very overcapacity youd really want some proper rehabilitation proper oversight of that community order proper understanding put to the judge and that all hinges on functions within probation which is fairly underresourced she said ive been told by probation themselves theyve got this huge recruitment drive they have got very new probation officers are we really at a point where we are equipped to do this properly because for domestic abuse that really matters jacobs said she was concerned that ministers had cherrypicked from the governmentcommissioned review by clare wade kc into a culture of misogyny in the criminal justice system the review was prompted by poor conviction rates in rape cases and soft sentences for domestic homicides jacobs said the government had failed to ensure that sexual infidelity could not be raised as a mitigating factor in a domestic homicide claiming there were already sufficient controls on a judges approach wade also recommended that strangulation as the common means of domestic homicide should be made a statutory aggravating factor in domestic abuse cases but the government did not agree jacobs said what wade was very clear about was that these recommendations really couldnt be cherrypicked they needed to come as a package and they have been somewhat cherrypicked a criminal justice bill going through parliament had also failed to ensure police forces were properly dealing with cases where an officer had been accused of domestic abuse jacobs added a freedom of information request made by the domestic violence charity refuge found that between may and may there were cases of police misconduct or gross misconduct involving violence against girls or women jacobs said the bill should include a provision requiring the removal of warrant cards from police officers under investigation for crimes relating to women and girls in wayne couzens used his police warrant card to lure sarah everard off the street before raping and murdering her he was later convicted of three incidents of indecent exposure committed in the runup to the murder jacobs said he had been exposing himself days and weeks earlier if theres known behaviour or allegations are afoot i dont believe they should be carrying around a warrant card that gives them that kind of tremendous power a government spokesperson said we have been clear our sentencing reform does not apply if an offender poses a serious risk to an individual or is in breach of a court order such as a stalking protection order and we engaged with domestic abuse charities to raise awareness of these important safeguards this government has taken unprecedented action to protect women including landmark legislation in response to clare wades review to ensure domestic killers get the sentence they deserve we have also introduced new laws to crack down on stalking and coercive control clares law which gives women the right to know if their partner has an abusive past following the police dismissals review the government is working at pace to introduce substantial changes to the misconduct vetting and performance systems the vast majority of these reforms are being implemented through changes to existing secondary legislation not via the criminal justice bill,2023-12,abusive men england wale walk free court new sentencing policy fly face minister claim take domestic violence seriously independent government watchdog ha said

labour is considering creating thousands of nursery places inside existing primary schools in england and has tasked the former ofsted head sir david bell with finding new ways to increase levels of childcare in the latest evolution of labours policy in an area that still has a widespread shortage of spaces plus a lack of affordability and staffing bell will advise on potential ways to tackle this with detailed policies set out nearer the election bell was chief inspector of ofsted from to and went on to be the top civil servant at the department for education the plans first reported by the times could include integrating nurseries into schools meaning parents could take their children to the same site from the end of parental leave until the children are old enough to start at the school itself a labour source said there was a particular focus on helping to create spaces in areas lacking them childcare hours are no use to parents if they cant get places thats why families are

week of taxpayerfunded childcare for weeks of the year from next april after september all eligible parents of children under the age of five will be able to get funding for hours a week of childcare

a metropolitan police officer who was assaulted and raped by an expartner has channelled her ordeal into targeting domestic abusers the trainee detective constable who works in a safeguarding unit in east london was a student when the abusive relationship left her feeling suicidal the woman who is not being named for legal reasons hopes that speaking out about her experience will give victims the confidence to report abusers to the police she said she now realised that her former partners behaviour bore all the hallmarks of every form of domestic abuse she investigates as a police officer she said i didnt really have my own money my money was his money so he was controlling my finances he used to physically assault me in front of our friends he would hold me against the wall by my throat he sexually assaulted me on more occasions than i can remember and he raped me twice during our relationship the woman said she had decided to become a police officer before she met the man but her experience had an influence on the sector of policing she went into i didnt know i wanted to investigate domestic abuse until after i escaped my personal situation and i realised i wanted to help people who were going through and had been through things like i had she said the ordeal had enabled her to empathise with victims and help other officers on her team to understand domestic abuse the nature of domestic abuse is very different to any other form of crime the not being able to report it and the trauma linked to it i think having that personal experience does help to identify that within victims and i think help them trust the police a bit more sometimes the woman reported the man to the police one month after she ended the relationship it followed a suicide attempt in which she was taken to hospital the case was closed due to a lack of evidence it was my word against his she said apart from my account there was no evidence i had not received any injuries severe enough to go to hospital i had spoken to a few people about it but none of whom i was still in touch with whod be able to corroborate that the relationship predated the domestic abuse act which introduced nonfatal strangulation as an offence the act also amended the definition of domestic abuse to include coercive and controlling behaviour the woman believes that the change in the law has allowed police to provide greater protection to victims when i reported it coercive and controlling behaviour wasnt an offence neither was nonfatal strangulation so it was taken as the individual offences of the assault and the rape she said domestic abuse is so much more than the individual incidents its the longterm effects of it and coercive control does take into account everything that happens throughout the relationship that individual offences like rape and assault dont because they only look at one particular time when you can incorporate coercive control and have the bigger picture i think it really helps to understand why its gotten to the point it has and also the longterm effects that has on victims as well she said she hoped that the convictions of the former officers wayne couzens and david carrick demonstrated that the police were not above the law previously a lot of victims didnt want to report if the perpetrator was a police officer because they thought well i cant report my police officer partner to the police for abusing me because im not going to be believed she said you now can report youre going to be believed and these people theyre not being protected as such that may have been seen years ago theyre being found out reported and convicted and theyre not hiding within their profession,2023-12,metropolitan police officer wa assaulted raped expartner ha

victims of domestic abuse have lost confidence in britains biggest police force after a series of scandals a senior officer has admitted det supt andrew wadey the metropolitan polices lead for domestic abuse and stalking acknowledged the force had let women and girls down badly in the past but insisted they were committed to rebuilding trust domestic abuse accounts for about of reported crime in london in the past year the met recorded domestic abuserelated murders of which were against women it also recorded six suicides all women in which there was a history of domestic abuse though wadey said the true number was probably higher wadey said an additional officers would be placed in public protection roles across the force over the next year including detectives dedicated to investigating domestic abuse the drive comes after highprofile scandals involving the former met police officers wayne couzens who raped and murdered sarah everard and david carrick who was convicted in january of rapes and assaults making him one of the worst sexual offenders in modern times wadey said he and his colleagues were absolutely devastated and disgusted by the cases which had made officers jobs more difficult its certainly not helpful for our jobs he said weve got to go through a period now in which we very publicly go through a process in which we root out those officers and do all of the work that i and my colleagues are doing to try and restore the faith of women and girls by improving our response to domestic abuse to controlling and coercive behaviour towards all of these really harmful and appalling behaviours that we see across society he said the scandals had had an impact on womens confidence in reporting domestic abuse we know we have let women and girls down badly in the past and we must improve our service and behave with respect and compassion to earn back trust wadey said i engage very closely with colleagues who work in the vawg violence against women and girls sector who work with charities ngos etc and they absolutely have given their feedback in terms of their concerns following those really highprofile cases but i think crucially though they are working with us to try and restore that confidence with victimsurvivors he said there were just under reports of domestic abuse in london each year and the volume of offences had risen every year since from about to a month despite the numbers going up and up domestic abuse was underreported he said it is a staggeringly high number and we know its underreported as well so theres work to be done to increase the confidence of victimsurvivors to report so as volume goes up thats not necessarily a bad thing from a policing perspective because hopefully that means people are accessing the police and other services better than they have been able to before wadey described domestic abuse as the largest driver of crime demand within london and probably across the country he said domestic abuse services were struggling to cope with caseloads and creaking under the demand we know across the network they are struggling to cope and manage the demand thats coming in and thats across the system from our perspective weve recognised that and as a result were increasing the number of resources dedicated to investigating domestic abuse he said that as well as bringing the number of officers investigating domestic abuse up to frontline officers had received domestic abuse training focused on controlling and coercive behaviour the met also launched its vawg action plan this month detailing new commitments which include building trust and confidence and making safer spaces for women and girls the government is seeking to overhaul punishments to protect women from domestic killers proposals announced in july seek to lengthen the prison sentences for abusers who kill by creating a new aggravating factor for murder at the end of a relationship the government is also seeking to increase the minimum sentence for murders inside the home where a knife or weapon is found at the scene currently if a killer uses a weapon found in the home the tariff is years whereas if a killer murders a woman in a park with a weapon brought from elsewhere they can get years wadey said the scandals involving couzens and carrick were an appalling and very very difficult thing to witness playing out but his message to his team was to avoid being defensive i think the instinct when you come across that is to say thats a minority its nothing to do with us blah blah blah he said my message to the teams were fine but how have these people been amongst us without being detected and as a result weve got to look at ourselves and look at the way in which we challenge behaviour or not challenge behaviour and take some responsibility for that,2023-12,victim domestic abuse lost confidence britain biggest police force series scandal senior officer ha admitted det supt andrew wadey

opportunists are targeting victims of domestic abuse by lying about their professional experience and charging them for legal and emotional help capitalising on the vulnerability of victims and the lack of governmentfunded support available they pretend to be qualified counsellors domestic abuse consultants or specialist lawyers while advertising fees that they claim are lower than standard rates mel who is still being abused by her expartner was contacted by a woman she did not know after she liked a post from a legitimate charity on social media i thought she was reaching out to help me but then after i opened up about the abuse she started asking for money mel said she kept asking me to book a session putting me under pressure constantly messaging messaging messaging it made me feel anxious inside in exchanges seen by the observer the woman sent mel an average of one message every minutes requesting she book two sessions for without a response however if you want me to be on call for you she said it will be a fourfigure fee ive already been to so many organisations asking for help mel said they are either limited by budget or to a specific area i dont live in i wouldnt be so desperate if i already had someone to talk to one website advertises online training courses for victims to get ready for the family courts for up to with the help of a bacpregistered therapist which refers to the british association for counselling and psychotherapy who also claims to be cpd accredited a qualification for people running certified continuing professional development courses approved by the cpd register but both the bacp and the cpd registers confirmed to the observer that the therapist is not on either of their lists and neither is the online course advertised the images of previous clients on the website paired with reviews of the course are all photos lifted from stock footage on the internet charlene simba founder of domestic abuse charity gracesimba community village said that many of the women she works with have been financially exploited by opportunists they are just scammers who are taking advantage of vulnerable women she said the failings of the family courts and established domestic abuse services are creating a loophole for these socalled consultants who say they are cheaper than solicitors they say they know the system well giving the impression that they can make judges understand the experience of abuse and trauma but they dont follow through on their promises while some of these pseudoprofessionals connect with victims by finding and contacting them directly as in mels case others meet vulnerable women through established communities such as religious groups and spot the opportunity for financial exploitation some also simply advertise their services online and wait for people to search the internet for alternatives to the professional help they cannot afford when dealing with the family courts in all these cases those offering legal or emotional help are often not transparent about the fees they charge many victims like mel have already spoken openly about the abuse before the individual starts asking for money so they feel obliged or afraid that the support will suddenly stop multiple websites seen by the observer advertising domestic abuse services from unqualified providers do not even display their fees with one victim saying she was charged extra for something she thought was part of the service simba who is herself a survivor of domestic abuse said she was asked to pay for coaching sessions by two different women she met through her church after building a relationship with her both women started asking for money to help her in one way or another in an invoice seen by the observer one of the women charged simba for days of coaching on a onetoone course from toxic to healthy and then continued to charge her a month to talk about building a good foundation for relationships and breaking destructive cycles so that she could end the abuse herself in the end she just retraumatised me simba said she has no training to deal with victims of trauma she just left me feeling anxious and overwhelmed simba is trying to stop this type of exploitation through her charity which matches victims with professionals who can help them for free so that they will not be forced to turn to unqualified individuals we are supposed to help and protect vulnerable people she said not take money from them,2023-12,opportunist targeting victim domestic abuse lying professional experience

i dont have a magical vagina that tells me what dougs mother wants for christmas these heartfelt words of my friend christy began my conversations with her and doug her partner meet christy growing up christmas was a very big deal in her family three generations crammed around the diningroom table with christys father at the head the omniscient santa and chief turkey carver meet doug he grew up in a blended family of jews and atheists so christmas was not valued in his household given their seemingly conflicting upbringings how do you imagine christy and dougs first holiday postpandemic will unfold as they attempt to host parents and inlaws who are travelling in from opposite ends of the country while also juggling their two elementary schoolage kids and still both trying to work remotely until christmas eve challenging is what i told them when they asked me for advice unless i said you give yourselves the gift of structured decisionmaking to christy and doug im their outspoken friend from law school but since our years at harvard ive interviewed thousands of people including childless couples working and stayathome parents coparents blended families and samesex families whose candid data became the basis for my book fair play a time and sanitysaving home management system that aims to create more equity and fairness within families and domestic partnerships the statistics regarding inequity which showed women performing twothirds or more of the household tasks whether they worked outside the home or not were the reason i wanted to tackle this issue but recent analysis by the brookings institution shows that since the book was published the pandemic has widened the childcare gap in homes mothers with kids under reported they spent eight hours a day on childcare while working sixhour days for their employers another study by the pew research center found that mothers working remotely were more likely than fathers to say their parenting responsibilities interfered with their work including promotions and the ability to raise their hand for important assignments in homes without structured decisionmaking women continue to shoulder the weight of the extra workload waiting for them underneath the mistletoe at this time of year that gendered divide is more apparent at least to women than ever all the unpaid and often invisible holiday labour requires real time and effort from someone in your household rather than engaging in divisive titfortat over who does what or who does more or suggesting that together you attempt to do it all i recommend using structured decisionmaking with three easy steps first experiment with valuesbased communication sit down with your partner over hot chocolate or a hot brandy look over every task on your list and ask yourselves does performing these tasks hold value to us discuss why each one is or is not meaningful and important in the past and the present depending on your lifestyle and beliefs many tasks can come into play at this time of year things like gifts what kind of gifts does your family value experiences or the latest trinket groceries which meals mean the most to your family storage garage and seasonal items will you be decorating every room of the house adult friendships in one of the busiest seasons of the year how will you give each other time to connect with friends parents and inlaws what kind of relationships are your family able to have tidying up organising and donating how do you define tidying up clearing the table or a full refresh of the home hosting will you hold a huge winter bash or just have the parents and grandparents over in the holidays magical beings which magical beings will be a part of your familys story santa elf on the shelf mensch on a bench after identifying your values as a family take a look at the tasks on your list if something no longer holds value can you throw it out this step can be especially hard with so many societal expectations on what should be done at this time of year decide together as a family how you are going to set your boundaries once you have an honest discussion and determine what tasks and traditions are worth the effort within your home define what it means to complete the task from start to finish and determine what tasks each person will do you must get granular or you run the risk of doubling up on efforts or unintentionally dropping the ball as an example preparing christmas dinner means delineating and assigning full ownership of the task you can both provide input but only one person takes the lead setting clearly defined expectations and standards establishing a measurement of accountability for example all grocery items must be bought and in the fridge two days before the event and communicating regularly after i walked christy and doug through these steps they realised that while theyre looking forward to hosting a full house this year what they hold most meaningful and dear is spending time together as a small family of four so once the house is empty they plan to take a road trip before the new year where they can celebrate each other separate and apart from extended family traditions and demands once you and yours begin playing for value and delineating responsibilities in the spirit of fairness you too may discover a greater sense of ease and joy throughout the season and thats well worth celebrating eve rodsky is the author of fair play and find your unicorn space,2023-12,dont magical vagina tell dougs mother want christmas heartfelt word

even before i heard the bang on our front door christmas was special our son percy was five weeks old and since he was my parents first grandchild there was a huge amount of excitement my mum couldnt wait for us to celebrate together at her house a minute drive from ours in st louis missouri she expected us there at am sharp i was on the sofa feeding percy at about in the morning when i heard someone running up our icy front steps after some frantic banging on the front door i heard more footsteps now running away assuming it was some lastminute gift delivery i called to my husband rob to open the door laura he said stepping back into the living room a few seconds later with a stunned expression theres a kid out here like a child playing a joke i asked no he replied its a baby rob shouted that it was so cold he was bringing it in after i put percy down in his basket i turned and saw rob holding a car seat sitting there was a baby in a blue jacket staring at me i was in a kind of shocked trance this baby looked older than percy i guessed somewhere between nine and months he also looked healthy and well cared for the second rob put down the car seat and stepped out to knock on our neighbours door the baby started to cry my instincts kicked in unfastening the straps i picked him up held him close and began speaking theres someone out there who loves you i found myself saying im sure of it but if there isnt then i will love you it will be ok i promise it was as if he understood because he stopped crying rob returned explained that the neighbours werent in and called as i heard rob say er weve just found a baby i held the boy close and felt a surge of anger how could anyone have abandoned a child especially when it was c outside waiting for the police was surreal my mind was all over the place i was sure there was a mother out there looking for him as hed responded to the kindness in my voice but some part of me was also preparing for the alternative i even thought about fostering classes i might have to take when the police arrived about minutes later i was holding the baby and rob had percy who was now awake turning to a woman who had emerged from the police car one officer asked maam is this your baby i have never seen anyone move so fast she flew up our steps in a split second took him from my arms and seemed to collapse over him sobbing knowing that he was now back where he belonged i felt myself relax as the two of them were led back to the car rob and i went inside to give our statements then we heard what had really happened the mum and baby lived just a few streets away after putting her son in the car that morning shed realised that she hadnt locked her front door in the second she stepped away a teenage boy had stolen the car discovering the baby in the back seat he panicked leaving him on our doorstep and driving away i shivered what if hed left the baby at an empty house or if wed already left for my mums im a novelist and wrote down the experience in a facebook post that night hoping it would help me process it instead it made it seem even weirder finding a baby on your doorstep on christmas day it just sounded ridiculous but the post was read by the babys mum and the next day i received a heartfelt message from her his grandma also wrote thank you for keeping my grandson warm i never saw the baby again but i did see his mum at the court hearing about the theft and she told me he was well as for the teenage boy i knew it could have ended in tragedy but i felt sorry for him he was a victim too in a way a year later we moved to a new neighbourhood percy now six has grown up hearing that for minutes on christmas day he had a big brother my dad is a vicar and said it was a christmas miracle i dont know if some higher power meant for us to take care of the baby that day but ill always be thankful we were there to open the door when the knock came as told to kate graham do you have an experience to

i am by my own admission sickeningly smug about how balanced a relationship i have with my partner ours is what some might deem a rather millennial alliance we are equal breadwinners work the same hours and divvy up the childcare we communicate well about our feelings our finances our families he doesnt babysit our son he parents him we even have a civil partnership because we felt marriage was too problematic too steeped in historical gender inequality there are no boy jobs or girl jobs in our household so why when it comes to christmas do i find myself doing all the bloody work the festive merrygoround starts in september when the annual text comes in to me of course from a family member what are you thinking for christmas this year and so begins my seasonal shift as a logistics coordinator no pay managing the needs of different relatives working out who we prioritised last year and who we need to consider this time tentative suggestions about our plans are met with shrugs and sures from my partner as i liaise with friends and family on timings locations and now we have a baby to think of festive nap schedules should he nap at my mums or yours pram or car before or after lunch sure sure sure the list of plans and of people to communicate them to is seemingly endless and seemingly my responsibility im not alone in this a straw poll of my female friends who are all in relationships that id say are as similarly balanced as ours revealed the majority feel they too shoulder the christmas load both physical and emotional it is perhaps no great surprise that so much of christmass cognitive workload falls to women in the us sociologist arlie hochschild came up with the term emotional labour to describe the aspects of paid work that require managing and performing emotions like flight attendants having to smile the term has since expanded to refer to the invisible mental load that women take on around unpaid domestic work the planning the delegating the coordinating the communicating the worrying the caring given these types of jobs inevitably increase over the christmas period which is focused typically around family time and children its little wonder women find themselves taking on more of the cerebral donkey work but its not just emotional labour that women undertake over the festive period a study found women were responsible for christmasrelated jobs including buying and writing christmas cards making nativity costumes and preparing the christmas dinner if hosting and in my experience sometimes even if not even after christmas the work didnt stop as women were tasked with getting children to write thankyou cards meanwhile men took on only nine jobs two of which were setting up new toys often meaning quality time with their children and carving the turkey i assume this means their partner got up at am to put it in the oven and sporadically left the festivities to baste it making carving the turkey the christmas equivalent of buzz aldrin and neil armstrong being written into the history books after the moon landings while poor old michael collins who flew the damn rocket became a mere footnote my personal gripe is giving presents although hes not great at christmas in general my partner seems to have a particular blindspot when it comes to gifts i remember quite fondly actually one christmas eve coming home from the pub together to find my gift sitting unwrapped on our kitchen table this much i can tolerate within the privacy of our home we share similar views on the insanity and excess of christmas shopping my issue is with presents for others i remember much less fondly the christmas when despite my repeated reminders he used wrapping paper and sellotape borrowed from his mum to wrap our young nephews presents bought by me on boxing day morning mere minutes before the boys opened them in reality no one actually minds and if anything uncle stuarts mad boxing day dash up the stairs to wrap the presents has become a jolly family tradition i suspect my fear though is about being seen to be disorganised around christmas time and that the blame will inevitably fall on me not him perhaps its due to my having internalised the narrative that women are meant to be on top of everything especially at this time of year i worry too that the people around me family members friends have internalised it as well thus while my partner can get away with such slapdashery by grinning winking and cheerfully taking the stairs two at a time sticky tape in hand i feel prying curious eyes on me wondering why i didnt step in sooner to sort it all out so what can we do if were fed up with decking the halls alone if we dont want to always be the stocking fillers if actually all we want for christmas is someone to share the mental load with us you could go nuclear like a friend of mine who one year refused to buy any presents on behalf of her husband it led to a few awkward christmases but paid off in the long run he sorts out his own gift shopping while she kicks back with a baileys i took a slightly gentler approach talking when i spoke to my partner about his approach to christmas he explained apologetically that he found the whole thing presents in particular too transactional which is why he struggles to engage with it it was helpful to hear his side of the story even if it didnt give us an immediate solution later on though he approached me in the kitchen and excitedly told me of a thoughtful present idea hed had for one of his nephews come back on boxing day

my daughter tsubam was born on july i dont remember what we ate for her first christmas i had to ask hiraki my husband who we had over to eat it with and as someone who now owns four boxes full of christmas decorations i dont remember decorating a tree either what i do remember is the warmth that came from my mothers friend hazel being there too ive known hazel since i was born late november that year she had emailed us to ask if she could come and meet tsubam and stay over she was and headed to saxmundham suffolk for a short course in care work and wasnt sure where shed then be posted for the three months of her stay in the days before she got in touch i called my mother in france in a state our landlord had decided to put up our rent by so id found a studio flat upstairs in the same house for me hiraki tsubam and our two cats but i really had not yet figured out how id get the move done also although i was on maternity leave from my job i was working with hiraki on a film composing a soundtrack for a show opening in midjanuary in tokyo the disturbed sleep of new motherhood was brutal when hiraki was away for work i didnt sleep at all recently ive found myself swaying even when im not holding her i wrote to one friend another friend came over for an afternoon when i told her i was hallucinating id been on the couch trying to feed tsubam and had reached out for my glass of water only there was no glass perhaps more than the logistics and the exhaustion i was wrestling with how to mother that christmas breastfeeding remained confounding ive had these boobs my whole life id rail if they had one job surely this has to be it but i couldnt do it and if i couldnt do that what else wouldnt work an answer will come my mother said then hazel came back we had the keys to the studio flat three weeks early hazel hadnt found a placement after her training so i suggested she return to london she could stay upstairs while we remained downstairs it was middecember she would be with us for christmas i bought her warm socks it would be easy to paint this simply as a perplexed new mother being comforted by an older wiser other mother but hazel was just as much at sea as i was only on the opposite shore she had married at and had the first of her four children at shed lived on farms and never travelled alone or left south africa save for zimbabwe until now she was learning to navigate the world on her own after four decades of being a mum i was only just getting started hazel suggested i put tsubam in a cardboard box so i could get stuff done shell be safe she said shed propped up all four of her babies and her nine grandchildren in a laundry basket while she hung up the washing so we buttressed tsu with cushions a crocheted blanket a rattle and a softeared bunny called denki and planted her on the living room floor for the first time in months i unfurled its quite something to have no mum around hazels daughter had written after her departure which is exactly how i felt too my parents who lived in france were unable to come until january as my father a pastor was working over christmas i spoke with my mother every day and played james taylor at christmas because thats what my father does but there were moments when i needed their stronger shoulders now i had hazels i helped hazel register with hmrc and made us rice bowls for lunch she held tsu when i needed to work with headphones on i took her cups of tea mostly we didnt try to fix each other what kept us focused was this tiny baby girl tsubam means swallow like the bird hazel said just holding her gave her hope she called her my angel which lands differently when crooners all around you are singing about cherubim we didnt have a star atop a tree but we did have that babys smile i bought a dozen allbutter mince pies and branches of red berries for christmas day hiraki vaguely recalls dinner being okonomiyaki thank you for including me in last nights meal hazel emailed me from upstairs on december it really meant a lot to me she once told me that she has a chair in her house just for hugs no words needed every time tsubam wakes up all hot with sleep and wanting a lap to sit on i think about hazels quiet loving presence being with her that christmas meant the world to me too,2023-12,daughter tsubam wa born july dont remember ate first christmas ask hiraki

kensington palace earlier this week showed kate taking her three children to a baby bank in holyport berkshire where they helped volunteers sort christmas presents last month she visited sebbys corner in barnet north london one of a growing number of baby banks being set up across the country to provide free nappies clothes and formula milk to families in need sabine goodwin director of the independent food aid network said theres a fine line between soliciting donations with a positive spin and normalising a charitable response to poverty the princess of waless heart is undoubtedly in the right place but we cant afford to see royal patronage through rosetinted glasses we need to be collectively shouting from the rooftops that baby banks like warm banks fuel banks and food banks shouldnt be needed if we are to put the baby bank genie back in its bottle combining calls for systemic change with much needed efforts to fill the gap is critical graham whitham chief executive of greater manchester poverty action agreed saying it is vital we dont further normalise charitable responses to poverty he added that kates visit had raised the profile of the challenges facing many lowincome families it must also be a wakeup call for national and local decisionmakers as to the need for responses to poverty that address the root causes ames taylor chair of greater manchester money advice group responding to the royal visit posted on social media thank goodness there were cameras that we might know of such good deeds we are a rich country there should be no baby banks no food banks and no warm spaces people should have enough to get by and the safety net should keep people safe kensington palace declined to comment the duke and duchess of sussex meanwhile have

with a speed that may not surprise anyone i have an update on last weeks column which concerned my fiveyearold sons newfound propensity for swearing to recap he had taken to uttering the foulmouthed if charmingly incoherent exclamation forfookinsake when frustrated we were worried by its regularity and vehemence but especially by its codhibernian pronunciation which pointed to a clear provenance from his foulmouthed and irishaccented parents careful readers will note that this is a fancy way of saying we wouldnt have minded so much if we thought we could blame anyone other than ourselves in that column i moreorless made the argument that its best not to draw attention to such things particularly if your child isnt using it for shock value well that was last week when i was a merciful god king passing pearls of wisdom to the parents of the world and this is now where i have been once more shown to be gods one perfect moron you see the very next morning after filing that piece i prepped him for the school run as i screwed on his warmest hat he noticed his little sister wasnt dressed yet with nothing but innocence in his eyes he turned on the threshold and said are we not going to fucking nursery as well i gawped for a few seconds gone was the charmingly naive forfookinsake the clumsy formulation of which offered a tiny fig leaf of comedy value at least no here was adult contemporary anglosaxon in its purest form spread through my own misguided munificence examining my reaction now its hard to articulate exactly why i dont want my fiveyearold son to swear it may sound obvious on its face but easy moralising rankles its true i dont want it to reflect badly on me but i realised in that instant that even if he never did it in public and only ever to me id dislike it i certainly dont think it suggests a lack of intelligence or vocabulary which was the line very much pushed during my own childhood any time i got to effing and jeffing my entire life experience since and i would argue even the most a passing glance through the collected correspondence of the worlds most talented writers and thinkers suggests that the correlation between vocabulary and profanity is reassuringly positive no the reason it hit me right between the eyes is that it is simply the most prominent recent reminder that hes growing up an unwelcome even blasphemous reminder that one day he will swear as much as he likes living and sleeping and cursing somewhere far away from me will venture out of his front door each day into a cold unfeeling world without me there to make sure he has his winter hat on i close the door and bring him into the living room right you cant say that word i say with the studied benevolence of a cool camp counsellor the kind of dad youd let be your dad forever that word you just said thats a bad word an unkind word youre not in trouble but you cant say that again especially not in school no matter what he buffered for a minute i cant fucking say

are all nepo babies really created equal should timothe chalamet whose uncle rodman flender directed leprechaun appear on nepo baby listicles that include stars with actually famous family such as lilyrose depp hailey baldwin bieber or sofia coppola sorry rodman outing supposed nepo babies is one of social medias favorite parlor games and it only grew more popular after becoming the subject of a new york magazine cover dynasties have existed since the dawn of the star system but younger generations are more willing to count an oscarwinning father or supermodel mother as a strike against an upandcomer sometimes there are debates over the titles true definition as we see with chalamet or billie eilish whose mom is a television actor and indie screenwriter but there is a certain category of nepo baby we can all agree on the double nepo the double nepo baby also known as the full nepo these kids are progeny of not one but two and sometimes more incredibly connected humans take brooklyn beckham son of posh and becks known for his outoffocus elephant portraits and being a professional instagram husband to fellow nepo baby nicola peltz daughter of a billionaire investor or the oppenheimer actor jack quaid the product of dennis and meg ryans nineyear marriage or dakota johnson known for her work calling out ellen degeneres over a birthdayparty feud shes not just the daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson but also tippi hedrens granddaughter liv tyler has a famous mom in bebe buell a famous dad in steven tyler and a famous father figure in todd rundgren theres also maya hawke ethan and uma thurman zo kravitz lenny and lisa bonet maude apatow judd and leslie mann willow and jaden smith will and jada pinkett smith and deacon reese phillippe reese witherspoon and ryan phillippe the latter recently showed off his opulent college apartment during a tiktok house tour how much do you pay for rent in new york the host asked to which philippe replied west village prices man for some viewers that could be translated as dunno ask mom and dad these kids earn the most online scorn simply because they had the best chances of success sure many of them are talented angelina jolie has two famous parents and an oscar but should double nepos mess up as drew barrymore did when crossing the picket line to film her talkshow during the writers strike this is the first thing armchair critics point to the more selfaware nepo baby might cop to their privilege sean astin allison williams and jamie lee curtis come to mind as does susan sarandons brood all of whom have their own imdb pages her eldest son with tim robbins jack leaned on his famous folks with a little winkwink when he made a satirical day in the life of a nepo baby instagram video sample joke i live in the coolest and most upandcoming neighborhood in new york city the upper east side miles sarandons other son with robbins recently posted on x thanking fans for supporting his mother who was dropped by her talent agency after speaking at a propalestine rally he had one request though im really grateful to see people on twitter defending my mom amidst a new era of mccarthyist blacklisting but can you please stop using the clip of her getting her hair done with her honkers out he wrote sarandons daughter eva amurri another double nepo as her father is the italian film director franco amurri makes no attempt to hide her connections saying that she grew up alongside other celebrity kids celebrating birthdays and holidays together but some full nepos for all that networking surprisingly lack savvy publicists who advise them to embrace their privilege instead they deny their nepo status see tis son king harris who recently got caught in a scuffle with his rapper father at an atlanta falcons game when ti said his child had grown up in a cushy home king insisted that his childhood had been difficult actually and that at times he wanted to run away to his grandmothers place tiny harris kings mom responded by saying that was because his grandma had let him use a pacifier until he was years old a piece of shakespearean drama maybe but it seems like the familys pulled it together a few days later the yearold released a single featuring his dad and brother domani aptly titled father like son the extended nepo family tree gwyneth paltrow a double nepo baby herself and mother to two of them called the nepo baby term an ugly moniker she might not like to know then that there are nepo babyadjacent figures such as the nepo boyfriend a man who rides on his more celebrated partners coattails jake bongiovi happens to be one as he booked film roles after meeting his now fiancee millie bobby brown the fact that he is also jon bon jovis son probably helped too ditto for travis kelce though football fans who knew of the tight end before he hooked up with taylor swift might disagree after news of their courtship broke the nfl player enjoyed a flurry of attention shooting him from a mere sports figure to internationally known arm candy then there are nepo friends formerly known as an entourage these folks are more likely to earn social media followings than real work though as time reported in a piece on the phenomenon kylie jenners longtime bestie anastasia stassie karanikolaou recently launched a line of vodka youtubers like tana mongeau and mrbeast have also catapulted their friends imari stuart and kris tyson respectively to influencer status though the traditional beneficiaries of nepotism are offspring there are nepo parents too the tiktoker charli damelio gave her parents the gift of social media superstardom heidi and marc damelio starred in a hulu docuseries about their lives it could be argued that kris jenner matriarch of the kardashian clan became a nepo parent after kim broke through reality tv fame to become one of the most famous faces of our time though of course kim and her sisters would never have gotten to capitalize on their minutes of fame if their momager hadnt set it up first for them and as the dallas observer delightfully noted in a story on nepo parents rob reiner brilliantly cast his own mother in the infamous when harry met sally deli orgasm scene sometimes raw talent transcends nepotism who else but estelle could have delivered ill have what shes having that memorably however if you didnt win the hollywood lineage lottery or befriend the right people consider this you may be a double nepo without knowing it on tiktok regular people share how their parents unglamorous gigs come in handy im a double nepotism baby in the best way i cant get jury duty bc my dad was a cop amp my mom was in prison one user wrote in a video or as another put it both my parents were engineers so im fairly certain i could probs instinctively drive a train or whatever it is they did if i wanted to as the saying goes youve got to network to get work,2023-12,nepo baby really created equal

as a child i wanted to be an actor but things were difficult at home when i was growing up i became a tearaway and before i knew it i was and pregnant my parents nearly had a heart attack id done my gcses and wanted to do my alevels for support i joined a local young mums group but when i mentioned i wanted to keep studying the midwife told me theres no way youll be able to do it if you want to go into education you should do a cooking course and then one day youll make a good wife to a divorcee it really riled me up it was like a red rag to a bull i was like thats it im doing this that moment set me on my long journey into education i got a flat for me and my daughter i couldnt afford the internet or a computer but it was quiet and i was able to work without any drama it was tough i would have a oneyearold on one arm and be studying using the other it was a halfhour drive to college and then a halfhour walk because i couldnt afford to park nearby but the thing that kept me going was when i returned home every day and i could see what my daughters future might look like that made me get up every day and go i was shocked when i managed to get aab in my alevels so i decided to study law and politics at sussex university when i turned up the parent accommodation was horrendous a single mouldy tiny room with no windows i could have cried they had a nursery but the opening hours didnt always fit with my classes so i would have to bring my daughter into lectures and bribe her with sweets and colouring books to keep her quiet she became a bit of a celebrity on campus in the second year i moved out into rented accommodation but in my third year the landlord wanted the property back a month before my exams ended i tried to find a property that would let you rent for a month but they didnt exist so i went to the council and they put me in homeless accommodation but the only homeless accommodation they had was for men it was a horrible little room my daughter had to limit her possessions to a single box as we had to put all our stuff in storage there was no phone signal or access to the internet and there were a lot of people with drug and alcohol problems one night a guy tried to kick down my door that was terrifying but also another moment where i just thought study and get out i graduated and moved to london to do a course to become a trained solicitor it cost so i worked as a waitress to pay this huge loan off while doing unpaid work experience but i was constantly applying for paid jobs and i probably applied for about before i found a legal job at a media company a few years later when my daughter was she started getting pains and said she couldnt walk or feel her legs it turned out she had a spinal condition and the hospital put her in emergency surgery that night doctors said they didnt know if she would ever walk again she was in hospital for a year and a half and i had to do all my final exams and training at a really tough law firm while sleeping in the hospital the hospital wanted me around more and so did my job so i felt as if i was failing at everything i thought i just hope ive not fucked her up through doing all of this there was a point where i was so exhausted that i fainted and fell down some stairs and broke my foot doctors said i should quit work but i had no option if i did that we would be homeless when she came out of hospital she eventually recovered and despite missing so much school did so well in her exams that she got a place at durham university where shes currently studying psychology our bond is so close and we talk every day i feel really happy settled and lucky it has worked out like this now ive got a bit more time for myself and ive even started doing some acting classes in the evening my career also blossomed and today i have my dream role as a director at sony pictures television working as a solicitor in the business affairs team looking back maybe it was a good thing that i encountered that discouraging midwife perhaps i wouldnt have been as tenacious otherwise but i achieved all these things because of my daughter she inspired me and gave me a reason to keep fighting and for that i am forever grateful,2023-12,child wanted actor thing difficult home wa growing became tearaway knew wa pregnant parent nearly heart attack id done gcse wanted alevels support

people who are expecting a baby spend an incredible amount of time talking about what to call it this is probably a diversion away from difficult questions such as what if im bad at being a parent and society shuns me or what if this ruins our relationship which is currently very beautiful as such the naming debate is a brilliant one the rest is way too hard newsflash though it doesnt actually matter what you call your child the baby is bigger than the word as soon as that is its name that is its only possible name for ages youll think your baby is the one true carrier of the name and everyone else called mathilda is faking it so anyway and a bit years ago my previous husband and i were having a conversation that lasted at least a fortnight which i now realise was needless he wanted to call our son thurston i had other ideas what about bruno nope because of bruno brookes or kit impossible as there had been a kid in someones primary school called that who was a tearaway i was basically resisting because i felt as if it would make the child a hostage to fortune what if he was nothing like thurston moore of sonic youth what if he wanted to grow up not cool not into guitars without that cerebral vibe what if he wanted to be stocky and into stock car racing what swung me in the end was when my husband said we could shorten it to thirsty and then he would make a good sports journalist i rolled over as soon as i realised how attached he was to the idea youre very soft when youve just had a baby i dont know if anybodys ever noticed that before anyway so here he is years old and thurston is of course the only name he could ever have had last week his namesake was appearing in conversation with stewart lee at londons queen elizabeth hall with an autobiography

free childcare thirty hours a week from nine months until primary school was the eyecatcher in the chancellors spring budget was this finally scandinavianquality nurseries no sadly a groan of despair rippled through the stricken earlyyears sector when the autumn statement at last revealed which nurseries will get to deliver this free only if parents can find a place many nurseries have been unable to survive on government rates with a rise in closures in the last financial year ofsted reports a net loss of nurseries in a year and tens of thousands of places gone the early years alliances own charitable nurseries have only left out of which operate in deprived places that the new economics foundation calls childcare deserts to understand the governments attitude look closely at its language note how it calls it childcare a babysitting service not nursery or earlyyears education note how it never mentions childrens wellbeing the chancellors budget speech spoke only of the economys million vacancies the need for tackling labour shortages and getting more mothers back into work for many women a career break becomes a career end he said this is economics not education or social policy labours largely lost sure start programme led to the creation of centres to nurture families and children and focus on child development research shows that a childs critical first years all but determine their future sure start aimed to narrow the gap between the most disadvantaged children and the rest before primary school sure start centres were a haven for families with any problems or just places for comfort company and advice there were health visitors too as well as trained nursery teachers parentrun dropin cafes parenting groups english language classes and employment advice but they were mostly swept away in by the brutal cuts of michael gove and george osborne rather predictably the educational gap between rich and poor children has widened since then under this government perversely children of the most disadvantaged families dont qualify for jeremy hunts free childcare to be eligible both parents or the single parent must work at least hours a week but that rules out many families with all manner of problems and obstacles whose children need early help the most and ignores the evidence that underpins programmes such as sure start us research followed poor children on an earlyyears programme for years every spent on intensive early support saved later in life as those children needed less social security or mental health care and fewer committed crimes with more of them in work and able to own their own homes the institute for fiscal studies found that sure starts existence in the uks poorest areas led to a drop in the probability of a child being hospitalised by age the ifs also found that sure start had little impact on welloff children which makes this governments policy even more perverse richer families are almost six times as likely to benefit from hunts plan according to a report by the new economics foundation many nurseries under financial strain will also have to deal with higher labour costs from april when the minimum wage rises to an hour carlyn cole manager of a small charitable nursery in harold hill romford says five of her eight staff are on the minimum wage although she thinks they more than deserve this almost rise it will hit the nursery hard im only paid a bit above the minimum she says theyre hiring for christmas in the local aldi and id get more on their checkout than as a manager here but we all love the job love the children and we stayed open all through covid to help key workers she tots up the rise in energy and food costs a threatened rent rise imperils their survival open since the nursery has been a mainstay of the local community its a deprived area where parents cant pay extra says cole and i dont know where these children would go they used to take many special needs children but cant afford to now hunt will pay nurseries only an hour for three and fouryear olds while twoyear olds get an hour the governments way of easing the strain is to increase the legal ratio of children to staff now that its one carer to five twoyearolds someone should take them to the chancellors office for him to try it for a day with the state projected to pay of costs under hunts proposals the chaotic patchwork of private and voluntary nurseries needs reform as radical as the founding of the nhs private equity has moved into childcare but only in rich areas cashing in on charging high rates for small babies the government doesnt cover the few remaining statemaintained nurseries have always been beacons of the highest quality so the shadow education secretary bridget phillipson plans new nurseries inside primary schools where falling numbers leave extra space shes keenly aware of the need to avoid ofsteddriven schoolification ensuring nurseries stay centred on child development and play hunt has delayed rolling out all the free hours so the next government will have to pay if money is tight labour should be more strictly guided than ever by the evidence highquality nurseries should get priority even before needy schools and well before universities that takes patience as it will take years to prove that a good start at nursery yields better results this time sure startquality nurseries must be embedded into the national psyche to avoid future cuts they must become politically impossible for any future malign government to destroy

child protection experts have called for an urgent nationwide hunt for thousands of new foster carers after a net loss of families in the past year and a record number of children being placed far from home social workers have described scrambling to find friends and family to take children in urgent need of safety and reported that children are sometimes placed in hotels foster placements at least miles outside county boundaries are up since figures show it is estimated that new foster families were needed in england to meet rising demand we need a lot more foster carers said john pearce the president of the association of directors of childrens services you used to be able to get a place quickly for younger children but in significant parts of the country thats not the case any more and thats driven by a significant increase in the children coming into care in some cases councils lacking local foster vacancies are sending children hundreds of miles away breaking family and school ties there has been a increase in the number of children in care since in england but in the past year almost twice as many households quit mainstream fostering than joined reasons cited include the rising cost of looking after children and older foster parents choosing to quit after the pandemic a social worker in a fostering team at a midlands council said that in the most urgent cases where police have determined that a child must be immediately removed from their home for their safety we often have mad scrambles to see if a foster carer can possibly take another child or if a child has relatives the team has sent children hundreds of miles away to scotland wales and london because no local foster families were available the cost to all of us and the young person is huge the social worker said a head of year at a secondary school in cornwall where pupils are being affected by the shortage said its unsettling enough for a young person to know they are being removed from their family without the added uncertainty and fear of being placed in an unfamiliar county far from every relationship they have ever formed a spokesperson for the department for education said we are taking a wide range of action to support new and existing foster parents by raising financial allowances above inflation and reducing tax rates to ensure they have more money in their pocket the department is launching a m recruitment and retention programme which began in september in the northeast where demand has soared and will spread to more than half of englands local authorities from next april kate lawson the director of external affairs at the fostering network charity welcomed the initiative but said it needs to go further and faster because children right now are not being placed where is right for them inflation including rising housing costs has squeezed the budgets provided to foster carers and tay jiva who runs sparks fostering an agency in manchester has calculated that the typical foster family spends about hours a week on administration meetings and training such that their effective earnings are an hour below the national living wage al coates who runs a fostering agency in london says he has councils as far away as derbyshire and cornwall asking for help he described social workers having to ring round auntie neighbours and scout leaders saying have you got room for a couple of nights we need to have a supply of foster carers that is sufficient for the demand family is often the best but is not always best we should be in a position where the

forfookinsake my son says under his breath and not for the first time he started saying this after a ninehour drive from holyhead to london this summer during which i may have uttered a similar phrase several times while trying to get his baby sister to stop being violently car sick his odd pronunciation of said phrase is partly due to his lack of profane vocabulary and partly his deepseeded english need to mock the boggy diction of his parents accents my tongue probably does swing a little closer to my roots when my mind is clouded with anger but it doesnt help to be reminded of this from the unblemished lips of my fiveyearold son we were doing so well back when he was three we began a mostly successful effort to stop swearing around him committing to a strict diet of minced oaths i still cant lower myself to say sugar or fudge but more bespoke variants like plorp flippity heckins and blooming grundies bring me some joy at least that time id turned the air blue during what i took to be a private moment of frustration causing him to repeat some fruity language back to us afterwards a cheerily bleated puck and thereafter a coruscating chorus of puck puck puck that followed us around the room as my wife cast me that admiring good job look you only get if youve really nailed your fatherly duties curiously hed recreated the more accurate pronunciation of this word by accident a whole year earlier during that nerveshredding period when he hadnt quite mastered the tr digraph pronouncing it with an f instead this was fine when he called trousers fousers trains fains and their tracks fax but garnered rather more salty results when it came to constant discussion of his trucks our policy with such outbursts then as now was to react as little as possible this is not easy the sad fact is that no matter how much we may groan when it happens in an adam sandler movie in real life it is undeniably funny when small children swear worse when your days are spent looking after said small children awash with all the drudge and exhaustion that can so often entail its a dart of pure strength comedy that can seem like water in the desert and yet you must remain stonefaced lest you cement it in their heads as a winning strategy for gaining your attention allow that to happen the theory goes and before long that innocent utterance from your blameless child will become their new catchphrase and youll be arrested by child services for having an infant who swears as if theyre working the big room of a working mens club in so we remain quietly paralysed hoping his utterances of forfookinsake wane away to nothing they are happening less and less while messing with his lego perhaps or having dropped some food in his lap we tell ourselves each might be the last and pray he doesnt repeat it in school and swear as little as possible and then i smash my big toe on the kitchen door and oh my blooming grundies flippity heckins plorp my life did ye hear mammy died
