admit it because my daughter has a nanny you think i am rich i am not but you are probably as prejudiced as i once was before i hired my nanny it is strange being a working mother there is the compromise between working and looking after your child and the fact that as a parttimer you feel looked down upon by both your employer and stayathome mums then there is the financial side you work but oddly dont see much of your pay before i had my daughter it was simple i worked five days a week and took home five days pay now i work three days a week and take home around one days pay i only get that because my mother is kind enough to look after my daughter one day a week otherwise despite the fact that i enjoy what i do it wouldnt be worth working at all when i read that parents are struggling to afford childcare i nod in recognition this week research from the daycare trust has shown that the cost of a nursery place is rising faster than inflation and now accounts for almost a quarter of the average familys income the average price is a week with those in inner london paying this new research comes on top of another survey showing a dramatic increase in the average earnings of nannies in london for example livein nannies now earn an average salary of more than a year up on a year ago daily nannies meanwhile make on average more than up a more modest this has been interpreted as reflecting a booming economy but i am not convinced surely it is more a case of supply and demand more mothers work so more childcare is needed that means increased demand not only for nannies but nurseries creches and childminders my own scenario seems crazy i pay my nanny out of my taxed income and then as her employer pay her tax and national insurance on top of that the government says it wants to persuade mothers to go back to work but its incentives pointedly dont cover nannies the childcare element of the working tax credit is worth of childcare costs up to a maximum of for a family with one child from employers can also give a week taxfree to every employee to help with approved childcare once again however that means childminders creches and nurseries but not nannies my case is obviously financial madness but we had little choice when my daughter was five months old i began working again initially only a few mornings a week my daughter went to a local childminder and it was all very satisfactory not to mention affordable five months later i got a job with longer hours at exactly the same time my childminder announced that she was giving up due to ill health i rang the local nurseries not only did most of them close between pm and pm totally impractical for a commuter but they also had incredibly long waiting lists in fact my daughter was already down for the only local nursery with longer opening hours she was registered there in april and has not yet been offered a place i investigated different childminders all the recommended ones were booked up but i saw some others i took up a reference for one but was told that although efficient the woman in question wasnt warm or loving others couldnt do the right days or wanted me to pick up my daughter too early in the evening the national childminding association admits that many childminders have long waiting lists and that was my experience i was left with no option but to look for a nanny previously thought of by myself as the preserve of the rich think liz hurley or cherie booth i still find it hard to believe i have one that is not to say that i am unhappy with my choice my nanny is great she comes to my house gives my daughter onetoone attention and doesnt mind staying late if the tubes are delayed but she is also very expensive so what is the solution the government does appear to realise there is a childcare problem but it would help if it could explain exactly what a nanny is the problem is that anyone can call themselves a nanny although many do have nurserynurse or childcare training nannies dont have to have qualifications ours is trained qualified and has more than a decade of experience however when we were looking we were inundated by women with no childcare qualifications they simply liked children and were hoping for an hour childminders must be registered and inspected by ofsted as must creches and nurseries but nannies are completely unregulated and that is why they arent included in the childcare incentives why isnt there a register for nannies whereby their work can be regulated and inspected last year the government via the surestart scheme launched the home carer programme aimed at parents shift workers for example who need someone to look after their child in their own home it only allows nannies to do this if they requalify as registered childminders takeup unsurprisingly has been low and there are just home childcarers however the government is apparently looking into how to extend the scheme to cover people who arent childminders and that may mean nannies according to one welloff friend of mine the best childcare solution is an aupair when i told him we didnt have a spare room he thought for a moment and then told us to get an extension sadly there are no government childcare incentives for building works parentstheguardiancom,2004-01,admit daughter ha nanny think rich probably prejudiced

its a wet morning but the drizzle does not deter the gaggle of mums and their buggies making a beeline for the gate of the corams fields play area in bloomsbury central london the strict rule on the sign explains that no adults are allowed in unless they are accompanied by a child this is not only one of the capitals most popular playgrounds and a rare oasis of open space in a builtup urban area but also one that has been hailed as a national model for its high standards of safety quality and supervision alongside allweather pitches sandpits a cafeteria a paddling pool and fountain as well as swings and slides there is a small farm with resident goats sheep and ducks the area is securely fencedoff from the nearby busy traffic and there are staff in attendance at all times the chair of the corams fields trust which runs the playground is the local mp frank dobson dobson admits it would be difficult to replicate corams fields elsewhere with its thcentury colonnades and the fact that the sites land value alone is estimated at m the playground which first opened its doors in now attracts up to children a day with the compulsory adults in tow of course the former health secretary last week published getting serious about play a review of childrens play designed to establish the principles by which m of lottery cash from the new opportunities fund will be spent it throws down a few challenges to ministers the report recommends that funding should be focused on areas and groups with the poorest access to goodquality play opportunities but with a major emphasis on the inclusion of disabled children who often lose out the review also urges the government to rule out a competitive bidding process which might discriminate against the worstoff councils with the greatest need in a nutshell ministers now have to decide whether to concentrate the money on a limited number of the worstoff areas or to allocate some to every local authority dobson says there are many examples of good practice throughout the country drawing up a national strategy has not been easy because the play needs of children differ from place to place children of different ages want different play facilities successful playgrounds and play schemes vary widely dobsons review reliant to a large degree on work by tim gill director of the childrens play council considered the importance of a variety of local authorityrun facilities from informal play areas and leisure facilities such as skateparks and kickabout areas through to adventure playgrounds and holiday playgroups as well as staffed open access facilities such as corams fields the exercise found patchy provision but in the worst cases identified dangerous and littleused play areas that had fallen into disrepair or were frequented by drugusers and child molesters the report also noted that there was a missed opportunity to make more use of school grounds and buildings which could be opened up more to community use outside school opening hours the publication comes amid growing public concern about levels of obesity among children and even toddlers with poor health caused by lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyles compounded by a poor diet is it any wonder that so many young people are stuck indoors slumped over playstations and computer games when they would be out in the fresh air playing if they had better facilities says dobson parents also want their children to be safe as well as doing more physical exercise a recent mori survey for the audit commission showed that activities for young people was ranked by adults as the single most requested improvement in local services while facilities for young children scored ahead of health education and housing and almost level with crime reduction dobson points to evidence that safer play areas lead to crime reduction he is now seeking guarantees of future funding when the current m pot has run out to reduce dependence upon the lottery cash however dobson wants local proposals to try to maximise the impact of that stream of funding by complementing and augmenting it or meshing it with funds from other sources the reports findings and recommendations will now be scrutinised by the department for culture media and sport as well as other relevant departments notably the department for education and skills education minister cathy ashton is understood to be taking a close interest but the first grants are unlikely to be awarded until next year kids the national disabled childrens charity welcomed the findings of the review but said it was worried about how the pot will be distributed sam brier chief executive of kids commented at present play is simply not an option for most disabled children and they are routinely losing out on all the physical social and developmental benefits that play offers we are however concerned that if the funds are distributed simply on the basis of geographical areas of deprivation many disabled children will once again miss out families of disabled children are predisposed to a greater degree of financial hardship than others irrespective of their geographical location we would therefore like to see the option of some funds being allocated to inclusive play work in every region as dobson emphasises the play lobby is not a particularly vocal one which means that it has never been given high enough priority by local and national decision makers children and young people spend more time at play than taking part in sport or art or cultural activities yet when it comes to funding play lags miles behind though it is not government policy i believe that a commitment to continue lottery funding of play facilities for the next decade would be a great step forward for childrens play and also a sensible and popular use of lottery funds,2004-01,wet morning drizzle doe deter gaggle mum buggy making beeline gate corams field play area bloomsbury central

a m scheme to provide childcare in schools all year round was announced today by the work and pensions secretary andrew smith as part of a package of measures to encourage unemployed parents to get a job from april schools in bradford west yorkshire and the london boroughs of haringey and lewisham will provide childcare in term time and during school holidays the pilot projects will also work with job centres to give lone parents extra help finding employment mr smith told a tucdaycare trust conference in london today my aim is that every parent who wants to work should be able to have access to affordable childcare when they need it by making better use of school facilities we can start to make this a reality we will work with local authorities to make sure that school buildings do not stand empty after hours and in the school holidays a scheme providing free childcare to unemployed parents if they get a job will also be piloted in the three areas added mr smith unemployed parents will receive a weeks free childcare if they get work to help them make the transition into employment parents taking advantage of the scheme would not have to take the free childcare in one chunk when

contribution from employers in parents paid bn in day nursery charges working families on lower incomes get help with the costs through a childcare tax credit but have to contribute at least of the

the soaring cost of childcare with nurseries charging up to a year per toddler will be exposed in a report tomorrow working parents are being stretched to the limit to secure care for their children concludes the survey from the daycare trust british parents pay the biggest childcare bills in europe with large families hit particularly hard says the charity the report comes amid an intense debate in government over how to fund the major expansion of childcare places that ministers accept is now needed by under plans being considered in downing street middleclass parents would have to pay for new statefunded schemes such as a onestop childrens centre in every town offering highquality care but poorer families would get them free or very cheaply however that could anger those who believe earlyyears services should be a basic right with some labour mps seeing it as a slippery slope to charging for other public services andrew smith the work and pensions secretary will signal his commitment to the goal of universal childcare a place for every child who needs one in a speech to the daycare trusts annual conference tomorrow my aim is that every parent who wants to work should be able to get access to affordable childcare when they need it he told the observer we are making good progress and we are ambitious to do more tomorrow smith will outline new ways to help including schemes offering single mothers or partners of unemployed people a weeks free childcare as a taster to build their confidence in leaving children with others and childcare facilities linked to jobsearch programmes on school premises however campaigners want a much bigger reform of support for british parents who now spend an astonishing billion a year on childcare the most expensive nursery uncovered in the daycare trust survey in south london charged a week for a fulltime place for a child under two more than the average womans entire earnings after tax and more than the cost of a livein fulltime nanny outside london youd have to be earning getting on for a year just to pay for that said stephen burke director of the daycare trust we are beginning to see an increase in supply of places but that is still patchy in different parts of the country the government has already promised a free nursery place for every three and fouryearold who needs one but these are only parttime meaning many working mothers have to pay for extra care on top the treasury will publish a review of childcare this summer which is expected to recommend creating hundreds of thousands more places by but debate is raging between the treasury and downing street over how to fund them aides are studying the danish system which offers statesubsidised places for all underfives whose parents want them the poorest parents pay nothing the rest pay on a sliding scale according to income although not the full market rate the issue is not how to apply charging to existing provision but how we finance expansion said one source close to the discussions middleincome parents at the moment are facing enormous childcare costsits not about saying you are going to be paying more you could even predict a situation where middleclass parents would be paying less for childcare currently the government subsidises childcare through the socalled childcare tax credit for eligible parents parents get up to a year for the first child and for the second however they get no more for third or subsequent children and it is not increasing as fast as childcare costs in the real world campaigners say that helps explain why large families are more likely to be poor half of children below the official breadline live in families of three or more youngsters,2004-01,soaring cost childcare nursery charging year

we all know that the proper place for injustice is the past when we encounter injustice particularly injustice to women we describe it as victorian medieval or neanderthal depending on the enormity because we are confident that such things are anomalous to our society no group is more confident of this than young women according to a survey conducted by the equal opportunities commission of women aged or under take it for granted that they are paid the same as men with comparable responsibilities and qualifications they are likely to be mistaken officially the average gap between men and womens pay is but there are good reasons to suppose that it might be as wide as this is certainly better than before the equal pay act of when the gap was but clearly not as good as most people assume there are many causes of inequality but one of them argues the eoc is that many women are unaware that they are not earning as much as their male colleagues the same survey discovered that workers of both sexes were surprisingly ignorant of what their colleagues earned maybe because salary has always been an awkward topic of conversation of those surveyed only in social classes a and b knew what their colleagues earned in social class e where traditional good manners evidently hold greater sway the figure was but manners aside it is notable that the better paid are also the better informed and that men are more likely to know what their peers are getting than women are with this in mind the eoc has launched a campaign to encourage women to make comparisons this includes a web page which allows anyone to see how their salary compares with other workers according to region and sector accessible through the eocs website the eoc also advises individuals how to encourage employers to be fairer it can be the case that neither employer or employees are aware that discrimination is going on the pressure for change must come from women of whom said that their opinion of an organisation would be changed if they knew it paid women unfairly only of men said they cared one way or another,2004-01,know proper place injustice past encounter injustice particularly injustice woman describe

low income families should get free childcare as part of a system of universal provision former cabinet minister stephen byers proposed today the former transport secretary a close ally of the prime minister argued that good quality affordable and flexible childcare was vital if the government was to achieve labours traditional goals of social justice and opportunity for all mr byers the north tyneside mp argued that the availability of childcare places should be a priority for the government and should not be left as a matter of geographical chance delivering the daycare trusts annual childcare lecture mr byers said the availability of childcare places mustnt be a lottery with the winners decided by postcode public provision of childcare needs to be universal this would require the government to move beyond its present highly targeted approach a commitment to universal provision would demonstrate that labour is in touch with the needs and aspirations of hardpressed parents who are juggling with the responsibility of being a good parent and the task of holding down a job mr byers acknowledged that such a strategy would involve significant costs though he did not put a figure on the scheme betteroff families would be expected to contribute to those he suggested mr byers said whilst places should be free to those on low incomes it would be reasonable to expect a contribution towards costs from those that can afford it i have no doubt that most parents would support the provision of extra places in the public sector on the basis of incomerelated financial contributions in order to have a place available and avoid the often prohibitively expensive private sector mr byers argued that with private provision too expensive or insufficiently trusted and public provision too limited too many parents face the dilemma of relying on informal networks of relatives and friends or giving up work altogether with the discussions on the governments next threeyear spending round under way mr byers called on ministers to prioritise universal childcare provision in addition he called for statutory maternity pay to be raised from to a week at an annual cost to the treasury of m and he argued for government subsidies to be extended from nurseries childminders and afterschool clubs to homebased childcare mr byers also argued the case for a register to be established for children deemed to be at risk of a lifetime of underachievement poverty and dependence so that state assistance in areas such as parenting skills can be targeted at an early

women working full time expect to earn the same as men but on average gross less a month the equal opportunities commission said today at the start of a fresh assault on unfair pay it published results of a poll by the market research firm bmrb international showing that of women expect to earn the same as a man with the same qualifications rising to among women under these women were heading for disappointment because the latest data showed the difference in average pay between men and women working full time is just over a year about the commission will today distribute thousands of mock pay slips to commuters arriving for work in london glasgow and manchester showing loss of earnings for being a woman alongside other deductions such as tax and national insurance under the slogan its time to get even the campaign will urge women to check whether they are being paid fairly using a salary calculator available via the commissions website wwweocorguk the poll found of women did not know what their colleagues earned compared with of men as a result women were more likely than men to be unaware of pay discrimination more people in professional and managerial positions knew what most of their colleagues earned than in clerical and manual jobs julie mellor the commissions chairwoman said forget about sex politics and religion pay is the new taboo in britain today the whole business of pay is shrouded in mystery and this survey also shows that if you are a woman on a lower wage you are even more likely to be in the dark on how much you should expect discrimination flourishes in this culture of secrecy when people cannot be sure they are rewarded fairly the commission said it was against the law to pay women less than men for similar work it called on companies to mount equal pay reviews to establish whether disparities are due to discrimination or occupational segregation involving recruitment patterns that cluster women in a narrow range of lowerpaid occupations meanwhile the union gmb published new research showing that the gender pay gap had grown to more than a week in the city of london the average was in london in eastern and southeast england in the southwest in the northwest in the west midlands in scotland in the east midlands in wales and in the northeast karen constantine the unions equal rights officer said the only way to

fewer than of the most senior jobs in public life are held by women despite the passing of sex discrimination laws almost years ago a new survey by the equal opportunities commission shows that women are still massively underrepresented in positions of influence in business the police media and senior judiciary even though more females are working than ever before research by the eoc reveals that women account for just of the senior judiciary and the senior ranks of britains police forces and of the senior ranks in the armed forces the research said to be the most detailed study of womens representation in senior positions reveals that just of the countrys top business leaders and national newspaper editors are women this is despite the fact that women account for of the workforce and of managers there has been progress assisted by such figures as dame brenda hale appointed a lord of appeal in ordinary last year kate swann the new chief executive of wh smith commander janet williams the new head of scotland yards special branch and barbara cassani the leader of londons olympic bid campaign but too many organisations pay insufficient regard to sexual equality when filling senior positions this discrimination even affects our cultural life only of the directors of major museums and art galleries are women and not one woman chairs a national arts company according to the eoc the commissions chairwoman julie mellor said almost years since the sex discrimination act was passed women are still massively underrepresented in positions of influence in britain no one can argue anymore that its just a matter of time until more women make it to the top there have been talented women coming up in business public life and politics for years recent media commentary on the honours system has also highlighted the low numbers of women to receive senior honours this reflects a wider problem that wont be resolved until britains leaders act to make sure women are not prevented from getting to the top the report entitled sex and power who runs britain says that despite all the talk of equality most organisations have left the same kind of people in charge open the door of any boardroom or council chamber and the chances are that most people around the table will be men it says its not democratic its not balanced and its not good for business the report says the way people organise their lives at home and work is changing women are having babies later and men are spending more time with their children but women still encounter particular obstacles women who care for children or relatives are still disadvantaged by the long hours culture and the assumption that by working part time they have abandoned all hope of career advancement they also lose out at the recruitment stage applications for senior jobs are too often generated through informal networks when women are considered the approach taken by interviewers counts against them because assessments of leadership potential often fail to recognise what they could bring to the job the authors say it is not rocket science caring roles and senior positions can be combined as some employers are already demonstrating the eoc is urging employers promote flexible working and to employ positive action where women are underrepresented this would allow them to take measures designed to counteract the effects of past discrimination such as making special training programmes available,2004-01,fewer senior job public life held woman despite passing sex discrimination law almost year

mothers should be freed to stay at home longer with their children through a big hike in maternity pay former cabinet minister stephen byers will argue this week too many women are being driven back to the office before they are ready because they cannot afford to live on statutory allowances he will say new mothers get per cent of their salary for the first six weeks dropping to only a week for the rest of their six months maternity leave byerss intervention comes as the government is drawing up a new package of rights for parents downing street will hold a seminar for childcare experts this week crucially ministers are keen to soften their position on working mothers amid arguments that they must not be seen to drive women back to work regardless of their families needs we must give new parents particularly mothers a genuine choice about whether to return to work or stay at home byers will say in a speech to the charity maternity alliance on thursday far too many women are forced through financial pressure to return to work when what they really want is to stay at home and bring up their baby labour is extending choice in areas like health and education it should now do so for new parents he said raising maternity pay to a week for the final weeks close to the minimum wage of could cost up to million a year but would give babies a better start in life debate between working and stayathome mothers has raged for years fuelled by conflicting research on whether children suffer from being looked after by people other than their parents byers said it was not up to politicians to dictate what women did but to provide more options people who are well off have always had that choice he said giving people choice who have never had it is a real political issue for us ministers are now engaging seriously with the sensitive argument about stayathome versus working mothers risking tensions with the treasury which has championed work as the antidote to family poverty harriet harman now solicitor general argued as a backbencher that during the first year of a babys life women should be helped to stay at home if they wanted to while patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary confessed that she regretted working when her children were very small liz kendall director of the maternity alliance said that while the governments investment in childcare for working mothers was welcome it was not helping mothers of young babies they are in danger of being seriously out of step with what most mothers want during the first year of life which is to have the choice to stay at home she said there is a political challenge not to be forced into one box or the other either everybody should be forced to go out to work or everybody should stay at home kendall said the relentless message about work did not reflect research showing that the babys first year of life is the most crucial in developmental terms it is how mothers feel about working that is the key she said if they want to go back to work and they have decent childcare thats good but if theyre forced to work long unsociable hours then if that is combined with poor childcare it can be bad for child development the intervention of a blairite such as byers over maternity pay risks irritating the chancellor since the level of the payment is set in the budget but maternal choice was discussed at a

the nanny state is a strange snobby fusty phrase in the minds of welloff male politicians of the postwar era it was a straightforward sneer nanny was a bossy female authoritarian figure they halfremembered telling them to drink their castor oil and wash behind their ears before bedtime the tens of millions of people for whom state intervention was most needed would have never come across nanny in their lives except perhaps as nan as in granny as for the millions who came across them only through popular culture nannies were mostly a benign fantasy sweetvoiced julie andrews sweeping in with a dose of sugary medicine and a sparkle of magic today apart from the tiny clique of americans and sloane rangers who can afford a norlands gal if nanny conjures up anything it is a keen confused homesick teenager from bratislava despite all this the cobwebbed phrase has stuck with rightwing politicians and commentators like the committee and whipping it is political jargon that has long outlived its origins unlike them it is loaded and always hostile the target is government meddling and interference in private lives and it is interesting that meddling is given a female form the nanny state wears skirts this is a time of year and a moment in politics when the issue of ministerial lectures is particularly timely its hangover time its new year resolution time and boy do the ministers have resolutions for you as the nation groans its way back into work clothes staring aghast at the extra rolling pounds our christmas binge has put on ministers such as tessa jowell are campaigning hard against the impact of the food industry on childrens diets hardly a day passes without new governmentapproved warnings on cholesterol stress sleep sugar and exercise new laws on using mobile phones while driving have come in ministers look on approvingly as the british medical association raises the question of whether there should be a general ban on smoking theres been a salt summit on the use of coronarythreatening quantities of salt in processed foods this is also a time of year when rocketing credit card debt has become a big public issue and yet offers to borrow more money drop through the letterbox daily as britains overweight indebted families look blearily ahead into the government is on hand to teach them family values too a raft of new measures aimed at the parents of antisocial children is now available to the police and courts only yesterday another female minister margaret hodge was being hammered in the papers for approving funds for parentline plus an email advice service for parents the childrens minister argued that good parenting could boost childrens performance at school by more than and that the festive season often highlights family problems and stresses hodges crime according to her critics nannystate meddling increasing interference by the state in peoples everyday affairs it is time to stand up for the nanny state for jowell and hodge and in other areas patricia hewitt and harriet harman and also in general for the states right and duty to involve itself in questions of diet health family budgets and good parenting the crucial point which critics of the nanny state fail to mention is that individuals and families dont stand alone none of us lives in a neutral social space unharassed and free to make wise longterm choices whatever the philosophical ideal in the real world we are bombarded by corporate messages cajoling us and our children to consume and borrow we are inhabitants of the more now spendit eatit society which let us not forget boosts the profits of the multinationals whether we like this way of life or not the consequences are clear america and europe face an obesity epidemic which may shorten the lives of todays children by years as compared to their parents working parents and the decline of the extended family have eroded parenting skills fact the torrent of borrownow propaganda from banks unthinkable a generation ago has resulted in a much more indebted society fact but this is only half the story affluent families have more freedom to deal with the consequences they buy the fresh food which isnt loaded with sugar and salt they buy mounds of expensive fruit for their children they paysubscriptions for gyms and health clubs and go on pricey diets they are bettereducated about health issues and they buy the parenting books they can respond to the latest musthave always a lie advertising for electronic goodies without falling into crippling debt oh yes and they can buy indomestic help nannies and their successors just as in urban america it is the poorer british who are most visibly damaged by the downside of consumerism this is pretty simple if you cant afford the expensive consolations of winter travel or dinners out then the homelier treats of chocolate burgers and alcopops are that much harder to resist fat now means poor pop idols stone michelle is a workingclass girl who stands and wobbles for millions pass a group of kids smoking and the odds are they will be female and poor and if poorer families fall down on the parenting front they cant buy in foreign girls to help plug the gaps who really thinks that a centreleft government should stand aside and do nothing the whole point of progressive politics is to stand with the most vulnerable people today that means helping counter the great commercial shorttermist forces that rain down nanny state once upon a time nannies were the carers and the copers for middleclass families whose

a childcare place for every youngster in britain could cost the government up to billion a year according to new analysis to be published this week the study comes as the government begins drawing up a blueprint on the future of state childcare to be published in july it is expected to focus on plugging crucial gaps for working parents such as summer holidays and afterschool hours when many struggle to find help with older children in particular mixed with more support for parents so that they can stay at home when their babies are very young harriet harman the solicitorgeneral will also this week cite childcare and the ability to juggle work and family as two of the top five priorities for a labour manifesto for women arguing that the government must promise practical steps to help women voters in their daily lives downing street is considering a commitment to socalled universal childcare a place for every child whose parents want one as a longterm goal for the next election manifesto but the study from the new charity children to be unveiled this week suggests this would cost an extra billion a year and would involve setting up childrens centres nationwide if they really want to tackle the whole issue of provision and seriously provide a universal network they need to double the amount they are spending said anne longfield director of children formerly known as kids clubs network if they invested that every year for years that would buy a childrens centre across every neighbourhood with all age groups catered for parents already spend over billion a year themselves on childcare she added with around billion in existing government spending which could be better directed topping that up to billion would answer parents calls for a reliable nationwide service this is not beyond the realms of what we have already considered and the savings in the long term would be great however with the chancellor gordon brown warning that this years spending round will be tighter than ever it is unlikely this much extra money can be found the governments new childcare strategy to be published alongside this summers spending review is expected to stress that it

when you tell the office youre pregnant you hope that your colleagues will share your joy but dont kid yourself their big question will not be about names the sex or whether youve signed up for pregnancy yoga they want to know when youre coming back in fact they want to know if youre coming back while you might think you know the answer there is always the chance that you might surprise yourself and want to go back to work immediately or conversely decide never to work again and then there will always be some option in between that you could never have anticipated while most of what you are and not entitled to is pretty much set in stone theres so much other stuff to worry about how do you tell the boss how do you talk about something unknown when you really havent got a clue how youre going to feel all this uncertainty makes for fuzzy answers so heres some advice to help you tackle the subject when the time comes be in the know do some research know your rights on each element of maternity before you start urges jacquie leitch hr expert at the boyd partnership and find out from an expert adds judi james author of bodytalk at work judijamescom there are always loads of armchair pundits around who will sound authoritative but you need to get your facts right someone else in the office or a close friend will never be a substitute no matter how assertive they sound she says leitch recommends tailored interactive guidance on employment rights wwwtigergovuk as a good starting point ask around your gp hospital or midwife will have lots of literature says jacquie leitch and try your public library or citizens advice bureau she adds but a lot of books about maternity are written in the us so they may not have the exact up to date information that you require she says so do double check your information before taking action write it down write down your own plan and notes advises judi james what do you want what would suit you are you going to try for more than your legal rights if so you will have to plan your negotiation carefully life enhancing if your employer offers statutory only benefits then you may wish to suggest that they set up an enhanced policy notes jacquie leitch and even if your employer does have an enhanced policy it may not be the best deal so find out what competitors do most companies wish to maintain parity in case staff resign maternity benefit is rarely a deal breaker or a sole reason for resignation but it does sometimes influence individuals to leave the company she says perfect timing if you want to try to influence your employer you may wish to consider starting your campaign before you become pregnant suggests jacquie leitch pregnancy hormones can affect your judgment and influencing skills and may mean that you become very personally involved in the business decision making remember always that although you are asking for improvements for your own benefit the company will have to look at whether it is possible to do for every woman in the company and remember that the best time to negotiate for better benefits is when a company is doing well she says dont fiddle plan your body language and appearance as well as your key points says judi james practise looking reasonable and unemotional take the line that you will have to be firm but flexible use positive eye contact when you speak dont get embarrassed about asking for what you want keep the eye contact going dont look away to the floor and use emphatic gestures as you speak avoid fiddling and face touching both of which will make you look unsure be subtle mirror the bosss body language and pace of movement subtly to help create empathy advises judi james take in at least three key points to prove why you should have this new arrangement or extended leave make those points positive bargaining tools how will they benefit the company as well as yourself everybody out perhaps there are other men and women at work who hold a similar view to you asks jacquie leitch water cooler conversations can be very useful so do some internal market research she suggests topics such as adoption leave and paternity leave could broaden the spectrum of coworkers who might be interested in getting involved but beware she says it is easy to come across as a trade union organiser so take care how you approach your employer keep your options open laurence collins consulting director at ceridian hr ceridiancentrefilecom says that out of sight out of mind can be an issue for women on maternity leave and that good organisations will include you on any official communication while youre out of the office the grey area is whether the environment will have changed which could in turn impact on your role by the time you go back he says he observes that people who are deemed to be valuable get private concessions but also says of new jobs that are being created are now parttime top talent a lot of people are losing incredibly talented resource observes carol savage managing director of flexecutive wwwflexecutivecouk who adds that things have changed in terms of employers allowing people to work more flexibly but only in terms of a retention tool says savage clever people would use it for recruitment get sharing its not a case of full time or nothing says carol savage she suggests that you think about ways of doing one half of a job share step dont jump theres a real shock between going on maternity leave and coming back says savage her advice is to step back dont jump back phase in your time she suggests she refers to a financial controller whose boss said come back to work one day a week but do it from home employers are becoming more positive about this she says wanting your input as soon as possible is what matters whether youre at home or on the phone while youre in sainsburys but its still a big pain for employers says savage wryly as md of her own company she works hours a week but doesnt work wednesday and friday afternoons so that she can spend more time with her three children i can make up that time in the evening she says,2004-02,tell office youre pregnant hope

millions of pounds of taxpayers money pumped into expanding childcare facilities for preschool children may have been wasted because much of the new provision is unsustainable the governments spending watchdog warns today in a hardhitting report the national audit office acknowledges the huge strides made by the government through its national childcare strategy but notes that provision is patchy and unaffordable for many families the nao fails to specify how much money has been wasted but reveals that fewer than half of childminders playgroups and day nurseries were currently covering all their costs many providers did not know how many places they had to fill to break even and only half knew what they would do when government startup funding ran out sir john bourn head of the nao said providers needed more training in how to run their businesses so the impressive progress made by this government in creating childcare places could be maintained since the launch of the national childcare strategy in childcare places have been created in england but places have closed the report says some turnover was to be expected but the number of closures was higher than the government had predicted there was also significant regional variation in availability from places per preschool children in the southwest to just in central london the report underlines the huge investment made in childcare from different financial pots in parents spent bn local government bn and the department for education and skills and sure start programme m the childcare tax credit added a further m fulltime care for a child under two now costs families a year up on two years ago the report reveals yet it also points out that cost is not the most important consideration for parents when choosing a childminder playgroup or nursery location reputation quality of staff facilities and opening hours were more important sir john said the government has made impressive progress in creating new childcare places and in providing early education for preschool children since but not enough of these new places are yet in deprived areas where they would most benefit children and parents the governments investment will be wasted if the new provision is not viable more training is needed especially for childminders and providers need more support to help them manage their businesses the conservative mp edward leigh chairman of the commons public accounts committee said access to good childcare was vital but he was very concerned that new childcare places are being created willynilly with no real idea of how they are going to be sustained in the future the childrens minister margaret hodge said weve come a long way since the introduction of the firstever national childcare strategy we need to do more but its important to recognise the progress that has been made in a relatively short space of time further progress has been achieved since this report was compiled the latest figures show that there are now more childcare places than there were in back in there was only one childcare place for every nine children and there is now one place for every five children

more than women a year take legal action claiming they have been sacked for being pregnant the equal opportunities commission said yesterday in an analysis of discrimination in england and wales the first national investigation concluded that victimisation was rife it led to depression among women and unnecessary loss of skills for their employers even the system designed to give redress was itself discriminatory average compensation awarded to women for injury to feelings after dismissal for being pregnant was lower than for dismissals for other reasons the time limit for making a claim of pregnancy discrimination was three months obliging women to lodge their complaint during the later stages of pregnancy or soon after birth when they were least likely to want confrontation julie mellor the commissions chairwoman said tribunal cases were the tip of the iceberg its helpline received more calls from women on problems related to pregnancy at work than any other subject it reported that many companies saw an employees pregnancy as a warning of difficulties in future one woman told the commission my employer told me that getting pregnant is disgusting and that im obviously not careerminded another said i work for an organisation that seems to believe having a day off for a hangover is pretty macho but having a day off for morning sickness is a pain in the neck i call the place jurassic park a third said im being picked on persistently my immediate line manager has suggested that im screwing the company and that i used a table in the meeting room to lie down on if i was tired ms mellor said with the average cost of replacing one member of staff amounting to the economy and individual employers themselves simply cannot afford to lose valuable skilled staff just because they are pregnant the research showed the usual pattern was for women to be dismissed before going on maternity leave sometimes within hours or days of informing the employer they were pregnant the commission says just over of women aged to are pregnant at any one time and just over half are employees this suggests about employees are pregnant at any one time maternity leave

it has six bedrooms two bathrooms picturesque views across the cumbrian hills and can offer bed and breakfast accommodation for one night or full board for a week need an early morning call in the morning sir no problem want something special for dinner thats not on the menu madam the fulltime housekeeper will get on to it straight away it has kitchens and staff quarters to satisfy every whim of the guests it can cater for a hotel by any other name for children in less than four weeks jumping jacks playcentre in the rural market town of wigton could become the first nursery in the uk to offer hour care for children parents who use the centre can expect to pay an hour for leaving a child overnight the hour care for children aged months to years has been in the planning stages for nearly a year and is an ofsted inspection away from opening all the building work on the centre has been completed and the final decorating work on the six bedrooms is nearly finished the bunk beds are in place with three blue rooms for the boys and three pink ones for the girls it has already taken bookings for the months ahead and if the ofsted inspection goes well and staff are confident it will the centre will open for business on march jane crawford manager of jumping jacks is aware of the controversy the centre could cause is it ever right to leave your kids at a nursery for days on end but in defence of the decision to offer hour care she points out that it is just good business sense creating a service to satisfy demand when we first came up with the idea a lot of the parents who use the centre now were very interested says crawford we have a lot of shift workers in the wigton and surrounding rural area a lot of people are parents who have to work night shifts one week and a different shift the next week there are also nhs workers in cumbria who work different shift patterns and then of course there are the emergency services there is a lot of demand for something like this in our area crawford believes any parent in britain who works shifts will be hoping and praying for a similar centre in their area it can be an absolute headache trying to juggle the demands of work and parenting were just hoping to be of assistance in that headache some businesses in britain can offer nightcare to staff on an emergency basis but the difference here will be that we will be able to offer this service to anyone who needs it at present the playcentre has a baby unit a day nursery an outofschool club and a youth centre it also has breakfast clubs and holiday clubs catering for up to children if the expansion plans go ahead it could have nearly children on its premises at any one time hours a day crawford says the centre has the extra staff in place to deal with any eventuality weve been working very closely with ofsted to make sure we meet all the regulations regarding safety issues we have six rooms so we can separate children of different ages all the menus have to be nutritional and pass strict inspections were going to have a good range of meals well be having all the usual food children love shepherds pie chips that type of thing but there will also be an emphasis on healthy meals too if a child has any special dietary requirements we can also cater for that staff and management are sensitive to the charge that jumping jacks is just a childrens hotel parents could come here and book their children in for a week while they go off to spain or whatever but thats not something we can do a lot about were a business offering a service and the parents who use the centre are our customers thats all crawford says the main reason the centre is offering care for up to seven days is for parents who have specialneeds children and need some respite care again a few of the parents who already use our facilities for their specialneeds child at present are very interested in placing their children within the new centre having a disabled child or specialneeds child can be absolutely exhausting for the parents the centre will be somewhere for the child to stay while the parent or parents can have some time on their own lesley dixon is a childcare worker from wigton who says the centre is a godsend her nineyearold daughter lauren has cerebral palsy and she plans to use the overnight care one weekend a month i think this is a wonderful idea and i believe it can offer a service to someone like me that is invaluable i have another daughter kimberley who is and this will allow me to spend more time with her too lauren attends the centre at present and loves the place well try it out for one weekend a month and see how it goes as well as the support from parents the centre has also received state funding of the total cost of the project is coming from the new opportunities fund but such enthusiasm is far from universal stephen burke director of daycare trust expresses his concerns this centre is clearly responding to a need in the area it will serve but our main concern would be that staff at the centre are able to provide highquality care that is suitable for the children and care that the parent can be happy with however rather than seeing more of these centres in the uk we would prefer the government to introduce better homebased care for example nannies who can stay overnight which is something im sure most parents would prefer too crawford though is passionate that jumping jacks is answering a common need i think people are finally waking up to the fact that the traditional way of working nine to five monday to friday mum at home and dad at work is over being flexible is something employers are demanding more and more parents have been aware of this for a long time and have had to struggle through trying to maintain that elusive worklife balance everyone is beginning to wake up and realise those stereotypes are finally over andrew martindale and his wife kathryn are typical of the parents jumping jacks aims to attract andrew works shifts as a train driver while his wife is an auxiliary nurse in the nhs the couple have two children ryan nine and caitlin five in this day and age parents cant just be parents they also have to be breadwinners says andrew its not the way many parents would want it but its the way it is both kathryn and i work very strange shifts and trying to arrange cover can be quite difficult obviously the children come first but we have to earn as well i think its a brilliant idea and believe more and more of these centres will open up before too long its fine if you have lots of family support to be able to cope with the unexpected changes on shifts but if you dont then something like this can make your life so much better whether its a childrens hotel or a hour child centre crawford believes that while jumping jacks may be the first such establishment in the uk it will not be the last we are confident that roundtheclock care will prove to be very popular here she says im just amazed that no one has thought of it before i wouldnt be surprised if in a few years time theres one of these on offer in every town and city in britain,2004-02,ha six

when a report on domestic violence was published last week harriet harman sounded much like every vexed feminist has sounded for the past years in the study of nearly reported cases of domestic violence only per cent had ended in successful prosecution per cent had gone to court half hadnt even been recorded by the police we need to make sure men know they will be prosecuted and sent to prison the solicitor general urged police policy is now to prosecute she assured us but its a question of getting the message through to officers on the ground sending offenders to prison would have a real effect on the prevalence of domestic violence she said this prediction has been an article of feminist faith for as long as i can remember we have insisted that the only way to stop men beating their partners is to bring the full vengeful force of the law down on their heads and we have been reciting statistics for decades by now few people can be unaware that one in four women will become a victim that two women are killed by their partner or ex every week or that more than a quarter of all reported violent crime is by men against women at home making domestic violence the second most common violent crime the solution to a crime this serious would have to be found within the criminal justice system it seemed perfectly obvious in this instance if in no other prison would work but what if it turned out not to its an unthinkable proposition but as harman said herself a policy of prosecution does now apply the expression just a domestic hasnt summed up senior police attitudes for years the piteous per cent conviction rate has to be explained somehow harman chooses to blame the legal system for failing to put its policy into practice across the board but in last weeks study the problem with almost half the cases which reached the cps was that the victim withdrew her complaint we could say it was because she mistrusted the system we could put it down to fear or ignorance or any number of feminist rationalisations available to account for this unexpected turn of events where the women turn out to be more problematic than the police but there would have to come a point where we accepted the victims feelings if women keep saying they do not want a punitive policy to insist that one works becomes meaningless i spent some time last year in a domestic violence cid unit in londons paddington green station it was staffed by highly motivated specially trained detectives they were clever and ambitious they wanted convictions and most of the time to their intense frustration they could not get them it drove them mad the reason they couldnt put violent men in prison was that the victims didnt want them to the modern solution is what police call victimless prosecutions increasingly they will try to gather enough evidence to secure a conviction without her testimony the logic is neat if the weak link is the victim then get rid of her victimless prosecutions are supposed to be in the womens interests unfortunately some of the women i met through paddington green didnt agree in fact they were quite annoyed the police couldnt always comprehend these womens maddening reluctance to put their partners in prison and so the women began to be perceived as part of the problem an ungrateful obstructive nuisance some of the officers seemed angrier with the victims than they were with the men who beat them up it is easy to see how their sympathy could dissolve into irritation but it is hard to see this as a feminist victory or as progress the presumption behind victimless prosecutions is that these women need their consciousness raising that they are too frightened or diminished to know whats good for them so the court will decide but a policy which assumes that the police are right and battered women are wrong is a perplexing triumph for feminism tony blair has described harriet harmans forthcoming domestic violence bill as a symbol of our determination to rebalance the whole criminal justice system around the needs of the victim given more time and more legislation perhaps prosecutions will begin to work but the wait cannot be limitless an american academic linda g mills wrote a book last year called insult to injury rethinking our response to intimate abuse half of all partners of violent men never leave she reasoned those that do go will return to the man beating them on average five times before leaving for good few want their childrens father locked up what most of them want according to mills is the man they love to stop beating them up mills wants couples to be brought into therapy instead of court if they are helped to understand the dynamics of intimate violence she believes they might be able to stop it a pilot project in canada looks promising but policy in britain is to exclude from couple counselling any couple where the man has been violent it is a curious situation that once a woman has been beaten she is denied the support that might save her relationship and her life so everything is left to the police after demanding so much of them you might say it was churlish or at least impatient to start wondering whether they really are the answer even raising the doubt risks reviving the despicable old suspicion that hitting your wife isnt really a crime and the police are worn out indignant the morning after an attack a paddington detective officer complained well call the victim up and suddenly were the troublemakers i say next time you could be in a coffin but no one can believe that their husband will kill them next time she could be in a coffin if one day we have to change our minds about how to defeat domestic violence we had better be willing because we do not

speculation about a new policy from the conservative party to pay stayathome parents an allowance report february has prompted a welcome debate about the kind of support parents need our society has changed almost beyond recognition over the past years in of couples both partners now work dads are doing between a quarter and onethird of parental childcare and without the unpaid work of over million carers britain would be facing an increase in the socialcare bill of billions of pounds but both employment and social policy have failed to adapt to these profound changes the challenge now for all parties is to develop measures that would genuinely give all parents and carers men as well as women wider choices about whether to work stay at home or combine both options at different stages of their lives at the moment many get a raw deal if they choose not to work the contribution they make to our society is not valued and they receive inadequate financial and other support if they go out to work their opportunities are often limited because of a lack of flexibility about working arrangements they dont have access to affordable childcare or social care and they are less able to make pension contributions twice as many women as men rely on meanstested benefits in retirement increased flexibility at work backed up by affordable professional care would help to give mothers fathers and carers more choice there is also a desperate need for new measures to boost womens retirement income this is a political issue that has finally come of age jenny watson deputy chair equal opportunities commission,2004-02,speculation new policy conservative party pay stayathome parent allowance report february ha prompted welcome debate kind support parent need society ha changed almost beyond recognition past year couple partner work dad quarter onethird parental childcare without unpaid work million carers britain would facing increase socialcare bill billion pound employment social policy failed adapt profound change challenge party develop measure would genuinely give parent carers men well woman wider choice whether work stay home combine option different stage life moment many get raw deal choose work contribution make society valued receive inadequate financial support go work opportunity often limited lack flexibility working arrangement dont access affordable childcare social care less able make pension contribution twice many woman men rely meanstested benefit retirement increased flexibility work backed affordable professional care would help give mother father carers choice also desperate need new measure boost womens retirement income political issue ha finally come age jenny watson deputy chair equal opportunity commission,"['speculation', 'new', 'policy', 'conservative', 'party', 'pay', 'stayathome', 'parent', 'allowance', 'report', 'february', 'ha', 'prompted', 'welcome', 'debate', 'kind', 'support', 'parent', 'need', 'society', 'ha', 'changed', 'almost', 'beyond', 'recognition', 'past', 'year', 'couple', 'partner', 'work', 'dad', 'quarter', 'onethird', 'parental', 'childcare', 'without', 'unpaid', 'work', 'million', 'carers', 'britain', 'would', 'facing', 'increase', 'socialcare', 'bill', 'billion', 'pound', 'employment', 'social', 'policy', 'failed', 'adapt', 'profound', 'change', 'challenge', 'party', 'develop', 'measure', 'would', 'genuinely', 'give', 'parent', 'carers', 'men', 'well', 'woman', 'wider', 'choice', 'whether', 'work', 'stay', 'home', 'combine', 'option', 'different', 'stage', 'life', 'moment', 'many', 'get', 'raw', 'deal', 'choose', 'work', 'contribution', 'make', 'society', 'valued', 'receive', 'inadequate', 'financial', 'support', 'go', 'work', 'opportunity', 'often', 'limited', 'lack', 'flexibility', 'working', 'arrangement', 'dont', 'access', 'affordable', 'childcare', 'social', 'care', 'less', 'able', 'make', 'pension', 'contribution', 'twice', 'many', 'woman', 'men', 'rely', 'meanstested', 'benefit', 'retirement', 'increased', 'flexibility', 'work', 'backed', 'affordable', 'professional', 'care', 'would', 'help', 'give', 'mother', 'father', 'carers', 'choice', 'also', 'desperate', 'need', 'new', 'measure', 'boost', 'womens', 'retirement', 'income', 'political', 'issue', 'ha', 'finally', 'come', 'age', 'jenny', 'watson', 'deputy', 'chair', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'commission']",200
parents who separate will be expected to agree parenting plans that give generous time with the children for both mother and father under government proposals to cut the number of bitter and protracted court battles over child contact the early intervention project to be piloted this year aims to bring parents together from the point of separation and help them to reach agreement the idea modelled on successful schemes in the us and canada is to help parents deal with the anger left over from their failed relationship which can get in the way of future cooperation they will be taught how to handle the problems of postdivorce parenting and told of the psychological harm that parental battles or being deprived of one parent can do to their children parents will be presented with a framework or plan for future contact arrangements which they will be expected to comply with the move a joint initiative of the department for constitutional affairs dca and the department for education and skills follows a growing acceptance by judges and ministers that the current system for resolving contact disputes is failing children and parents figures show that as many as of divorced fathers lose contact with their children stunts by angry fathers dressed as action figures scaling bridges and buildings have moved the issue up the agenda in the past few weeks activists from fathers justice have staged protests in london bristol newcastle upon tyne and liverpool police closed the clifton suspension bridge in bristol when four protesters dressed as batman robin

entrench parental attitudes rather than encouraging them to change it is illadapted to deal with the difficult human dilemmas involved notably when it comes to the enforcement of its orders the early intervention scheme is supported by judges including englands senior family judge dame elizabeth butlersloss president of the high courts family division lord filkin the family law minister in the dca has met representatives of fathers groups including sir bob geldof who is supporting their cause a spokesman for the dca said the government has been looking closely at early intervention pilots and will be coming forward with proposals that involve better education information and support for families in the near future the interests of the child remain paramount wherever it is safe to do so we want the child to have meaningful contact with both parents hamish cameron a leading child psychiatrist who backs early intervention said the problem is always that the husbandwife argument spills over into the motherfather argument in divorce its even more important to keep those two roles separate thats what early intervention does it saves court time it saves money and children get good

violent men are to be sent to americanstyle classes on how to treat women under a nationwide programme to reduce domestic violence the training will challenge male stereotypes of nagging wives or a womans proper role in the home and teach alternatives to coercive dominating violent behaviour it will aim to prevent abusive men attacking future partners or taking revenge on former wives past victims will be interviewed and offered advice on protecting themselves and their children the first nationwide approved programme to be introduced in april is based on one developed in duluth minnesota men will have weekly sessions for up to months on everything from sexual respect to how violence affects children and why the victim cannot be blamed for an assault its about not making excuses for choices you make and for behaving in an unacceptable way said nicola harwin of the charity womens aid who is trained in the method used in duluth its not the fact she is on at you to do the housework its about men being responsible for their violence a home office spokeswoman said the classes for offenders were seeking to protect future victims of domestic violence as well as the current known victims the results of pilot schemes in west yorkshire and london were encouraging but the home office says it is too early to draw firm conclusions about reconviction rates and harwin cautions against seeing the classes as a panacea the duluth programme was credited with cutting deaths from domestic violence in some us cities but harwin says spouses who stayed with their partners hoping the programme would change them were often disappointed the projects founders estimated that fewer than half of the men stopped physically attacking their partners and of those very few stopped being psychologically abusive harwin said what we have to be clear about to women is that there is no guarantee it will make him change and no guarantee it will protect your safety,2004-02,violent men

women make false accusations of rape for a number of different reasons including revenge guilt shame the concealment of an affair extortion and to test a husbands love sometimes it is little more than a desperate attempt to win sympathy and attention one of the few academics to study women who falsely accuse is keith soothill professor of social research at lancaster university he says women tend to make false allegations to get themselves out of trouble rather than to get men into trouble they lie when they feel constrained when theyre in a tight spot eighteenyearold wendy mcclung had just such reasons she made a false claim of rape to avoid having a row with her parents after spending the night with yearold stuart nicol for whom she babysat in february she was put on probation for nine months thirtyfouryearold deborah white claimed she was sexually assaulted with a pool cue and raped by two men in a bristol pub where she worked as a stripper confronted by security videos she admitted making it up to explain away bruises to her husband she was jailed for three months the whole thing gets out of hand and there just isnt the opportunity for the woman to bail out says soothill the process begins to take over research also suggests that of false allegers have a psychiatric history milroysloans psychiatric report for court stated that she has a history of emotional and behavioural disturbance including previous episodes of selfharm threatening behaviour and substance misuse the report concluded that she was fit to stand trial with a proviso however it is likely that a degree of personality disturbance is having an impact on the manner in which she presents an account of various events in the face of conflicting evidence and added she remains at risk of further selfharm when faced with stressful life events nadine milroysloan has a troubled past she remembers her childhood as unhappy she was her parents only child but had four halfsiblings from her fathers first marriage according to her this always caused tensions in the family and she found her relationship with her mother difficult theres never been any love in it it was a family in which silences were sought in her witness statement to the police her mother says i did not want to know the graphic details of the rape so i have never asked nadine and she has never told me thats how i prefer it her father also said as her dad i certainly didnt want to know about it we did not then and never have since talk about what happened since she was a teenager milroysloan has had bouts of excessive drinking and admits to occasional amphetamine and cocaine use when she was she was arrested and charged with assault after a fight with a girl outside a pub at she was charged with burglary from a chalet at butlins where she worked the following year she received a conditional discharge for using threatening abusive or insulting words after an argument with her husband in october she got into a fight with an assistant at a chip shop in cleethorpes threw her food at her and on her way out assaulted a fellow customer who happened to be standing there but milroysloan can also be great fun she is lovely to look at and men and women have always been attracted to her she is articulate and funny friends frequently describe her as bubbly yet all her life she has also found it easy to make enemies even her gp struck her off his list she now says that her mother stood by her only until she could cash the cheque for selling her story and then abandoned her she says that her two former husbands have turned against her scott sloan her second husband told a newspaper i thought she was a lovely little thing when i first met her theres a side to her like a child that makes you want to hold her and tell her everythings going to be all right she seems so vulnerable she is like a little lost girl but theres another side to her which is unbelievable and so horrible so awful i think she needs psychiatric help police were aware of milroysloans disturbed history and previous record humberside had a file of her allegations including domestic violence which they believed were false perhaps it was these suspicions and the seeming outlandishness of her claims that led to a day delay between her reporting the alleged attack and a full statement being taken from her perhaps this too is why the interrogating police officer was coldly procedural even as milroysloan sobbed no words of solace were offered by this time she was so confused about the couple that she was calling the alleged female assailant not lady joan but caroline hamilton interviewed again two weeks later on may she steadfastly stuck to her story there is no doubt she continued to believe it she sensed however that she wasnt being believed she became increasingly distressed by what she perceived to be the police dragging their feet and she complained daily to her diary that they were not listening to her on august she took an overdose of nurofen paracetamol and decongestants washed down with vodka she wrote in her diary i vomited them all up every time i was sick i was crying i didnt want to be sick i wanted it to work soothill believes a woman making an allegation such as milroysloans can be convinced she is telling the truth a woman can get into a situation she doesnt understand and then try and make sense of it somehow by constructing a story he says as people probe you you fit in other features make it tighter you get more and more convinced you begin to think it must have happened like that evidence to the contrary only bolsters your false belief the more the world is against you says soothill the more the paranoia sets in shell say well nobody ever believes me then she produces the very situation where that is the case so the paranoia continues and develops thats the cycle shes in milroysloan interpreted attempts to persuade her that the hamiltons were not in lehaneys flat as a conspiracy to shut her up she claims to have received telephone threats to drop her allegations she installed a panic button in her house in her diary entry for may she wrote someone somewhere along the line is trying everything to stop this investigation seeing neil hamilton as an influential establishment figure she puts forward an elaborate theory involving politicians vice rings rent boys tax fraud and all sorts of powerful people who will lie to protect their friend on august a phone call gave her fresh hope she wrote in her diary at pm today max clifford rang me and said do you know why im phoning i said no i was told to switch on the tv and he would ring back the hamiltons had been arrested it was all over the news mum rang and i told her to switch on the tv we both watched it either end of the phone i cried it was such a relief but so frightening i picked up the kids put tom in his pram carried summer and went round to my mums i left the house as it was i knew i only had a few hours until the press came neil and christine hamilton voluntarily attended barkingside police station in east london at pm on friday august the police said that they had approached them twice before asking if they could provide an alibi for the day in question and they had refused to cooperate the hamiltons deny any such approaches were ever made they did however know that such accusations were being made against them christine had earlier joked with friends at a dinner party if we were going to go to a sex party we would go to one in kensington or chelsea we wouldnt go to one in essex the police arranged for the hamiltons to be taken to a littleused police station to avoid publicity but the couple arrived with a tv crew led by presenter louis theroux who had been following them for his bbc documentary when louis met the hamiltons neil was questioned first for three hours followed by christine for minutes a relatively short time for someone arrested under suspicion of a serious crime rather than leaving by the back door they chose to deliver a startling statement on the front steps of the police station to the substantial gathering of reporters their solicitor michael coleman revealed full lurid details of all the sexual acts the hamiltons were alleged by milroysloan to have committed including christine forcing her to have oral sex it was an unprecedented move by someone arrested for sexual assault so was the hamiltons reaction two days later at another impromptu press conference outside their battersea flat christine pirouetted on the pavement in orange shoes pink trousers and a red jacket declaring i am wearing my normal clashing reds and pinks i am not a blue lady referring to the claim that she was wearing a blue dress during the alleged attack the papers were saturated with the story of the disgraced former tory minister and the cunning liar a sunday tabloid which had been pursuing her vigorously published milroysloans story under the name of miss a her former husbands her uncle and other members of her family and friends all did newspaper deals christine hamilton sold her story for an estimated once it was out she said we did the most to keep it going as then it was the only way to get them to back down we were absolutely determined to use the media to protest our innocence as loudly and often as we could milroysloan still enjoyed the anonymity granted to all those who allege rape a measure that neil hamilton had voted for when he was an mp she was in a very low mental state she had been prescribed antidepressants and tablets to help her sleep in the meantime there were continual offers from reporters to break her cover one week later she eventually succumbed selling her story to the news of the world for she received would go to her mother and the balance after legal fees had been met held in trust for her children i just want people to see me as i am not the monster ive been made out to be ive been the victim and i should be treated like the victim not the person who has committed the crime she said but the price for selling her story was high milroysloan was now known as the woman who had accused the hamiltons very quickly it became apparent that the hamiltons had a castiron alibi that saturday evening they were holding a candlelit dinner party for four friends at their battersea flat on the menu along with baked fish and champagne was a speciality of christines that was to become infamous jellied bloody marys earlier they had been shopping on kings road in chelsea stopping at waitrose they dropped off their purchases at their flat before popping out for a quick drink at claridges with six other people their mobile phone records and receipts supported these movements on august two and a half weeks after the hamiltons arrest police announced that they would be taking no further action against them the following day the hamiltons launched libel proceedings against milroysloan the action was later dropped but milroysloan still wary declared herself bankrupt she continued to hope that lehaney would be charged with rape until she heard otherwise from the crown prosecution service in november i put my stereo on full kicked the doors punched the walls and smashed everything i could i sat in a pile of mess and cried she wrote in her diary the cps letter read the metropolitan police has already decided that neil and christine hamilton could not have been involved in any attack on you it is therefore unlikely that a jury could be sure that you are correct about the other events that you have described there was another problem with her evidence she had said lehaney had knelt down to rape her lehaney suffers from arthritis and is unable to kneel when i visited milroysloan that late november she was shaking with grief and anger a giant television sang out while twoyearold tommy slept sunk into a highchair in his thomas the tank engine socks it was an empty rented home with few personal touches apart from a scattering of family photographs at that time milroysloans mother was still her staunchest supporter id like to go down with a pair of garden shears to the scumbag she said milroysloan herself said its a coverup im sure of it she continued to pursue her case even to the point of ringing up london cab firms to get timings from claridges to ilford in the forlorn hope of proving that the hamiltons could have gone there before entertaining their guests with jellied bloody marys it was futile in january milroysloan was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and for stealing property from the home of barry lehaney jewellery sleeping pills and in cash the theft charges were dropped given the bizarre details of milroysloans claim her previous convictions her disturbed mental state and history and their castiron alibi its startling that the case against the hamiltons proceeded as far as it did an internal scotland yard inquiry found that it should have been dropped within weeks rather than days and that the hamiltons should never have been arrested a more extensive inquiry has yet to report in the meantime the metropolitan police are refusing to comment but it is difficult to find an explanation that reflects well on them if they felt from the outset that milroysloan was spinning a story then why did they continue to pursue the case and eventually arrest the hamiltons alternatively if as their own guidelines require they take seriously every accusation of sexual assault why didnt they immediately interview the hamiltons rather than wait three months the day after the hamiltons were cleared their solicitor made a complaint to police that the course of justice had been perverted five months later milroysloan was charged appropriately as it caused much merriment the trial of milroysloan for perverting the course of justice opened on april fools day the hamiltons have always been portrayed as buffoons and the allegations against them reinforced every barroom joke the few court reporters always irreverent laughed openly when lehaney admitted to taking viagra because he couldnt raise a gallop even an usher had to leave the court because she couldnt suppress her giggles but milroysloan did not smile as she sat in the dock watching the world be amused by her misfortune she had just one supporter her third husband terry squires whom she had married six months earlier after he proposed to her in mcdonalds on my knees in front of the whole of grimsby terry remembers in this trial too milroysloan was her own worst enemy a week in she made a confession she could have made a genuine error about the hamiltons identity if i made a mistake im deeply sorry the wrong people were arrested she said in his summing up judge smith commented i cannot help saying it came across to me as reluctant he was right in private milroysloan claims that she was told to apologise by her solicitor in an attempt to ameliorate her sentence although judge smith described her actions as a cynical attempt to get money and fame and she was widely pilloried as a moneygrabbing liar hamiltons golddigging slut gets years splashed one tabloid it was increasingly to her disadvantage to stick to her version of events by the time she was arrested it had been made clear beyond doubt that the hamiltons could not have been in essex so her continued insistence that they were made her appear only more ridiculous and her eagerness to see lehaney prosecuted could have had no financial incentive no newspaper would be interested in buying a story about being raped by a pensioner in an ilford flat the only explanation seems to be that milroysloan has convinced herself that the attacks occurred i know there are incidents when people sleep with somebody then panic and make it up ive read that myself in the papers she says but i just want to clear my name i just want people to know i wasnt lying a psychiatric report for the court stated miss milroysloan does genuinely believe that she was subjected to rape and sexual assault irrespective of the verdict milroysloan is now in her third prison since conviction she is likely to be moved again soon she walks into the prisoners visiting area all cheery smiling with lots of makeup freshly applied she makes little waves at the other prisoners on nearby tables sitting with their families she herself has had few visitors just her husband and me the only other person she hopes may come to see her is her halfsister karen she has lost contact with everyone else she continues to see threats against her everywhere she says shes being stalked by which she means she is receiving letters in prison from strangers who dont wish her wellthough this worries her she seems a little proud as if it makes her important as if at least people have heard of nadine milroysloan during my visit her mood constantly shifts one minute she is smiling laughing even then her eyes well up with tears and she struggles to finish her sentence this particularly happens when she mentions her children i cant even think about them any more ive taken down their photos it hurts too much its better not to see them she has she tells me suffered yet another betrayal and is divorcing terry she says hes been seeing someone else has been trying to sell her story she has written to terry to let him know but in fact terry is her one remaining ally loyal believing in her and looking forward to the time when they can go to mcdonalds together again hes distraught that she is threatening to leave him sobbing down the phone i love her i love her to bits shes my life shes what i live for i just wish she were here milroysloan was turning on terry as she has on others so often before its as if she refuses to be loved as if she tests and taunts those who do love her until they cannot love her any more she poisons everyone and everything she touches said scott sloan she is a very insecure mixed up unhappy girl deep down you get the feeling she wants security love someone to hold her but for some reason she cant maintain a relationship terry called me again hed patched things up with nadine over her mobile from prison she was pushing me away he said she was really confused thinking that i didnt want her in their last conversation she had told him that the prison authorities want her to apologise for her crime but she wont he said with pride later milroysloan wrote me a letter in her schoolgirl scrawl the past two years have been so traumatic its been an uphill struggle some days its hard to go on i am innocent naive i accept maybe even immature at times and some people may not have liked me but i never deserved to be raped no one does everyone can hate me as far as im concerned but please believe me when i say do i deserve to be raped life destroyed and sent to prison does anyone in fact we have little idea what to do with women such as nadine milroysloan except publicly to parade condemn and incarcerate them and in the meantime we disproportionately flaunt their false claims so that every womans report of rape true as well as false is undermined milroysloan spent her th birthday in prison shortly afterwards terry received an emergency call she had tried to kill herself again slashing at her throat and wrists she is in despair she sits in her cell mulling over and over the injustices heaped upon her she thinks that were neither listening to nor learning from her and for all her muddled and misguided reasons why this should be so in a way she is right read an unshakeable delusion part one,2004-02,woman make false accusation rape number different reason including revenge guilt shame concealment affair

working parents face rocketing bills for registered childcare with the costs of nurseries childminders and afterschool clubs in england rising by more than inflation for the third year running according to a national survey from charity daycare trust for middle income parents it looks like the situation is going to get worse if plans announced by the government this week get the goahead margaret hodge minister for children said middle income parents who take advantage of allday childcare at state nurseries should cough up for half of the cost a parent who opts for a am to pm state nursery place will pay for half a day and if the childcare tax credit is anything to go by parents who have a joint income of about or over will be forced to pay in most situations where both parents work they are unable to take advantage of state nurseries instead they must look to the private sector for childcare a fulltime nursery place for a child under two now costs an average of a week almost a year thats up on last years figure and equates to nearly a quarter of the average household income of a week the typical cost of a fulltime place with a registered childminder for a child under two is a little cheaper at a week while for children aged two and over a place costs on average at nurseries and with a childminder for older children hours a week at an after school club typically costs the highest nursery cost identified in the survey was a week the costs are such that a working couple with for example a oneyear old and a three yearold in fulltime nursery places would face an annual childcare bill of if they live in the northwest while their counterparts in the southeast would pay daycare trust says that parents pay threequarters of the cost of childcare with the government paying most of the rest plus a small contribution from employers in parents in britain paid bn to the day nursery industry daycare trust director stephen burke says parents in britain already pay the highest childcare bills in europe they tell us they cannot afford to pay more affordable childcare for all is crucial to tackle child poverty to help parents work and train and to raise educational attainment quality childcare helps give children a good start in life the government needs to help all families access quality affordable childcare near where they live in the short term daycare trust is calling on the government to increase help for working parents through improving the childcare tax credit this is a benefit an element within the working tax credit available to households earning up to where parents both in a couple work at least hours a week and who pay for some form of registered childcare it can provide help with up to of your childcare costs the percentage you get depends on your income subject to maximum limits on the weekly costs you can claim for if you pay for care for one child the weekly limit on costs is so the maximum you can receive at is a week if you pay for care for two or more children the weekly limit is and therefore the maximum you can claim is daycare trust points out that working families on lower incomes who get help through the childcare tax credit still have to find at least of the cost of childcare and there is no extra help for families with three or more children using childcare the current average award through the childcare tax credit is only a week so the charity wants to see improvements to the tax credit acknowledging that parents with two or more children using childcare face double or more costs increasing the percentage of costs covered by the tax credit increasing the level of childcare costs covered to reflect the real costs parents pay reducing the hours the second earner in a couple has to work to qualify for the tax credit the charity says the government must subsidise places so that every family can access quality childcare at a price they can afford by having a childrens centre in every community a new report by professor hilary land for daycare trust and the tuc argues that the uk should learn from countries like france and sweden where there are more generous parental and maternity pay and leave systems if the government is to meet its target of abolishing child poverty in a generation daycare trust and the tuc say it must aim for a system of

middleclass parents could be made to pay for any expansion in childcare provision the childrens minister margaret hodge said today ms hodge said the current policy of providing all three and fouryearolds with twoandahalf hours free nursery care a day did not take account of the needs of low income families the minister told the commons work and pensions select committee that because parents who need more nursery care must pay for it those on low incomes were deterred from arranging any extra support she suggested that childcare provision could be expanded by charging betteroff families more for extra support there is already an understanding that parents contribute we are seeing how we can grow childcare infrastructure said the minister but mrs hodge said any reform would take account of the needs of working mothers and offer bigger tax breaks to poorer parents to offset the increased charges the chancellor gordon brown will look at reform of childcare funding in his next spending review the minister added mrs hodges comments came less than a month after former cabinet minister stephen byers called on the government to make universal preschool childcare its top priority and not to put cash solely into schemes aimed at the poor mr byers pointed out that childcare was now costing middleclass parents as much as a year in london arguing that they also needed help if backing for the welfare state is to be sustained a report by the daycare trust published last week said parents were struggling to afford childcare as the cost of a nursery place has reached nearly a quarter of average household income,2004-02,middleclass parent could made pay expansion childcare provision childrens minister margaret hodge said today hodge said current policy providing three fouryearolds twoandahalf hour free nursery care day take account need low income family minister told common work pension select committee parent need nursery care must pay low income deterred arranging extra support suggested childcare provision could expanded charging betteroff family extra support already understanding parent contribute seeing grow childcare infrastructure said minister mr hodge said reform would take account need working mother offer bigger tax break poorer parent offset increased charge chancellor gordon brown look reform childcare funding next spending review minister added mr hodges comment came less month former cabinet minister stephen byers called government make universal preschool childcare top priority put cash solely scheme aimed poor mr byers pointed childcare wa costing middleclass parent much year london arguing also needed help backing welfare state sustained report daycare trust published last week said parent struggling afford childcare cost nursery place ha reached nearly quarter average household income,"['middleclass', 'parent', 'could', 'made', 'pay', 'expansion', 'childcare', 'provision', 'childrens', 'minister', 'margaret', 'hodge', 'said', 'today', 'hodge', 'said', 'current', 'policy', 'providing', 'three', 'fouryearolds', 'twoandahalf', 'hour', 'free', 'nursery', 'care', 'day', 'take', 'account', 'need', 'low', 'income', 'family', 'minister', 'told', 'common', 'work', 'pension', 'select', 'committee', 'parent', 'need', 'nursery', 'care', 'must', 'pay', 'low', 'income', 'deterred', 'arranging', 'extra', 'support', 'suggested', 'childcare', 'provision', 'could', 'expanded', 'charging', 'betteroff', 'family', 'extra', 'support', 'already', 'understanding', 'parent', 'contribute', 'seeing', 'grow', 'childcare', 'infrastructure', 'said', 'minister', 'mr', 'hodge', 'said', 'reform', 'would', 'take', 'account', 'need', 'working', 'mother', 'offer', 'bigger', 'tax', 'break', 'poorer', 'parent', 'offset', 'increased', 'charge', 'chancellor', 'gordon', 'brown', 'look', 'reform', 'childcare', 'funding', 'next', 'spending', 'review', 'minister', 'added', 'mr', 'hodges', 'comment', 'came', 'less', 'month', 'former', 'cabinet', 'minister', 'stephen', 'byers', 'called', 'government', 'make', 'universal', 'preschool', 'childcare', 'top', 'priority', 'put', 'cash', 'solely', 'scheme', 'aimed', 'poor', 'mr', 'byers', 'pointed', 'childcare', 'wa', 'costing', 'middleclass', 'parent', 'much', 'year', 'london', 'arguing', 'also', 'needed', 'help', 'backing', 'welfare', 'state', 'sustained', 'report', 'daycare', 'trust', 'published', 'last', 'week', 'said', 'parent', 'struggling', 'afford', 'childcare', 'cost', 'nursery', 'place', 'ha', 'reached', 'nearly', 'quarter', 'average', 'household', 'income']",50

despite the fact that almost babies are born in the uk each year many employers still struggle to treat mothers fairly when they are pregnant and when they return to work as a result many women end up badly off financially accepting demotion poorer pay and even unfair dismissal if they knew their rights however they might put up more of a fight last april new rights were introduced allowing most female employees to extend their six months maternity leave entitlement to up to a year before returning to the same post but employment specialist michael burd of solicitor lewis silkin believes many bosses will struggle to deal with the qualitatively different challenge of a years absence its going to be a big issue he says employers will be denying people the right to return and getting themselves into all sorts of trouble we will start seeing how employers are responding from april when the first mothers who took a year off begin returning to work a lot of discrimination already takes place against pregnant women and new mothers according to the maternity alliance one problem is that many women do not know their rights the rule of thumb is that you have the right to return to your previous role and the same terms and conditions you enjoyed says rachael maskell equal opportunities officer of the union amicus if the job is still there the individual does have the right to go back to it adds sarah king legal officer at maternity alliance there is a partial getout for employers who must reserve the job for the new mother unless this is not reasonably practicable but maternity alliance says this getout applies only if the job no longer exists in which case the woman should be offered a very similar role or dismissed following proper procedures including consultation seeking alternative work and redundancy pay if these procedures were not followed its likely there would be grounds for discrimination and unfair dismissal claims through an employment tribunal common problems seen by maternity alliance include someone being replaced by the person who did the maternity cover or finding that colleagues have been promoted above them but king says women have strong clear rights in these situations often employers say we found that it works better with your replacement in the job or your replacement is better in the job than you are that is neither here nor there the individual does have the right to go back into the job similarly if colleagues have been promoted over a womans head in her absence she has a potential sex discrimination claim if she was not informed about the promotion possibility and invited to go for it too there is a fairly easy way of reducing problems says burd of lewis silkin most responsible employers have realised that they put themselves in the best possible position by maintaining a communications line with the person who is off if new mothers still receive newsletters and other communications have the option to do training and discuss arrangements for their return well in advance the chances of problems developing are much reduced julie mellor chair of the equal opportunities commission advises any individual can write to their employer saying they want to be kept in touch and saying the way they would prefer to do that when i was in this position i found it really difficult to take phone calls but newsletters can help and access to websites or trade publications on returning to work mothers also have the right to ask for though not necessarily to get a change in their working arrangements such as parttime working and it is not all bad news maskell of amicus says some employers are fantastic and do all they can maternity alliance advice line equal opportunities

i belong to a club that no parent would ever voluntarily join membership requires appearance in the family courts after failing to reach an agreement with a former spouse or partner about your children if your partner is making what you consider to be unreasonable demands over contact and doesnt agree to mediation tough you might find yourself as i did in front of a judge who will not only capriciously impose his ideas about suitable arrangements for your children on you but feel free to make personal comments after dismissing me as a bitter and overanxious mother my barrister assured me that if the judge passed me on the street later that day he wouldnt have a clue who i was it wasnt personal but there is little more personal than a complete stranger with the power to pass judgment on your parenting dictating how much time you spend with your children once laid down in a legal document these arrangements are hellishly difficult to change unless you can come to an arrangement with your by now deeply estranged partner everyone loses especially the children after the eviscerating experience of costly court proceedings it may take years to rebuild some fragile trust with the other parent who will have his own frustrating and humiliating tale to tell that is why it came as a crushing blow last week when the government appeared to reject an opportunity to bring real reform to the family court system the department for education and skills introduced family resolutions pilots aimed at diverting warring parents from the courts by encouraging them to use mediation services and parenting classes launched in london brighton and the north east the scheme will run for a year it sounds great in principle but look at the detail and weep mediation is not mandatory and since it offers no workable guidelines on contact this freeforall could easily flounder mediation already exists but will always have a limited function until it operates in the shadow of the law unless parents know what sort of orders the courts are liable to make anyone can quit mediation to gamble that the courts will take their side the new scheme gives parents in conflict little incentive to take up its woolly offer to make matters worse family justice minister lord filkin before handing the scheme to the dfes had been considering one modelled on north american practices the early interventions project which would have delivered dramatic change called for mandatory parenting classes where couples who had applied for residents orders would within weeks have to hammer out workable arrangements parents would only have to face a judge if they could not come to an agreement in florida where a similar scheme has been run since the early s the number of parents in court has plummeted moreover the government body charged here with running the pilot project is one that has historically opposed the principle of guidelines on contact the children and family court advisory and support service cafcass which currently makes recommendations on orders in disputed cases has been widely criticised by parents groups for its intransigence steve fitzgerald chair of the coalition for equal parenting which backed the early interventions project describes cafcass as a discredited organisation that has hijacked the project on the pretext that it is against the interests of the child i cannot believe that the department for education and skills has funded them to get on with the job he says oliver cyriax who helped devise early interventions says in the space of a few weeks cafcass has managed to vandalise a major reform it took hundreds of professionals eight years to agree leading child development specialists now agree on a childs general need for contact with both parents while cafcass operates on the assumption that every case is different today the coalition for equal parenting will meet shadow ministers dominic grieve and tim loughton to request crossparty support on an earlyday motion which would back the principles of the early interventions scheme as the number of court applications soars there has been a increase over the past

last weeks budget saw a longawaited breakthrough in tax relief for childcare from next april working mothers can opt to be paid up to per week in childcare vouchers which will be exempt from tax just as they are already exempt from both employers and employees national insurance contributions the governments record on tax allowances for child care has been good in its first budget it made the use of workplace creches a taxfree benefit inhouse creches are still relatively rare however and last weeks change extends the benefit to parents who have to make more flexible arrangements the vouchers can be used to pay for childcare within the home as well as outside to au pairs nannies and even relatives but not partners so the beneficiaries include middle class parents and all those who earn too much to qualify for working tax credits many parents will no doubt feel that a taxfree is not enough but the change itself is an important concession from the treasury and the inland revenue what has always been the issue is that money paid for childcare is money taxed twice once when earned by the parent and childcare is usually paid out of the mothers salary and again when the carers income is taxed last years working tax credits were introduced for parents on low incomes as an incentive to get single parents off benefits childcare vouchers make tax relief on childcare available to all workers the vouchers were originally launched in the late s the conception of anne ross now corporate business manager at accor who told me that she only began the project because she over estimated the initial demand the original idea was that the childcare voucher was to be as simple as the luncheon voucher which used to be widely issued by firms who did not provide their workers with office canteens ross persisted with her idea and today the childcare voucher is the most popular method by which employers contribute to childcare the vouchers are a commercial venture but without rosss

it is to be honest the trouble with men our inarticulacy our abject failure to explain our joy or capture our pain to let our humanity hang out and when love goes wrong nothing including its politics goes right for us then there is pain without gain then we are not mr big but mr puny so this week vociferous fathers who want to share their children are bitterly disappointed what do they demand their rights their designated half of their own kids what did they get from margaret hodge the minister for children just the chance of a little nambypamby no teeth afteryouclaudette mediation climb more cranes lads this dads army is getting desperate and of course we fortunate noncombatants need to recognise that no grief comes more raw than the icy tide that flows through the family courts too many divorces can turn visceral in a trice and slide into sheer bloodymindedness its an area the nanny state can barely reach but at least if we stop shouting for a minute we may almost hear ms hodge thinking the modest proposal for her to decide on remember was whether as in florida couples resolved to break up and fight out their custody battles in the courts here should first be required to go through a mediation procedure that spells out the sort of typical settlement a judge would anyway impose at the end of a long costly day access for dad granted on a generous scale and written into parenting plans the court could cite if one partner or another disregarded them firm tough stuff what no litigation the notion almost uniquely came backed by an influential collection of judges solicitors and legal campaigners lawyers voting for no delays and no fees put turkeys and christmas to shame for once though the disinterested parties seemed to be putting the interests of the children first but ms hodge hasnt gone the whole hog the necessity of mediation is there for the first time in her new policy she wants to sort things out but somewhere on its route through whitehall a few battles seem to have been lost the mediation she envisages wont come with plans and possible sanctions attached nor will it rely on any template settlements these will be quieter gentler discussions not virtual arbitrations and thus perhaps more flappy febrile stuff how cross can you get about that very cross indeed it is described as doomed to failure as cynical and an absolute sham spiderman wont be trading his fathers justice membership cards yet lets for the time being treat it as development work in progress lets put the big issues on the line in a world where carrie has just departed her city tv sex life six series and separate screen affairs later where blame is just as confusing as ulrika jonssons election as celebrity mum of the year consider the familiar wreck of a partnership are men the problem or the solution it is impossible to generalise or to keep emotion out of either reckoning existing law perhaps reflecting older assumptions takes the problem route it is in practice weighted on the womans side but men increasingly may be part of the solution too you can count around million children in britain who come from a home with no father you can calculate that over of them see their fathers less than once a fortnight and that have no contact at all you can also collate researches and prove that in general though not in particular children who see both parents regularly are probably cleverer happier and more stable dads on such figures arent an optional extra dads make a difference in the only arena that matters the one where children come first but how do we make kids our priority whatever the noises off is that something that whitehall can ordain two things stand out from the sad screaming history of the last few years one is pretty obvious that society has changed and is still changing in the way that it defines a womans role but that it has not yet adjusted its view of a mans role to match were still inarticulate out of the loop the other less obvious is that secret justice can be what bob geldof calls the most grotesque kind of injustice day after day in the form of legal warnings on the guardians internal messaging system the family courts spread their blankets of silence the interests of the children mean that nothing can be reported but they also alas mean that introversion rules family courts put sir roy meadows and his cot death expertise at stage centre family courts lend lustre to cafcass the widely criticised children and family court advisory scheme undertrained people on the ground who make crucial recommendations about custody family courts because of their secrecy lack even the basic records and information to construct those templates for mediation maybe that was why therell be no floridastyle pilots from ms hodge maybe the fathers justice shouted too hard and climbed too high maybe there are too many dads who just dont care or resort to violence to let the stereotypes change perhaps individual pain can never fit broad policy but talking in the end is still the only and the best way one of my sons is planning with huge excitement to take his sons to an fa cup semifinal its millwall history he says theyll always remember it and my other son at long blessed last is a father of a baby girl now hours old how do you rule love out of the equation whatever happens you cant the

measures unveiled by the government yesterday to try to divert separated parents from bitter court battles over their children were condemned by fathers groups as doomed to failure fathersjustice the group whose stunts have paralysed traffic around the country pledged to step up its campaign for a better deal for separated fathers pilot schemes to encourage warring parents to resolve contact disputes by mediation will be launched in london brighton and sunderland from next september but fathers organisations predicted that the scheme would fail and criticised the decision not to go ahead with a pilot more closely modelled on a successful early intervention scheme in florida and other us states the department of constitutional affairs had been consid ering a scheme modelled on one which has dramatically cut the number of court cases in florida judges lawyers and other professionals had consulted for three years and come up with a plan under which parents would be presented with sample parenting plans with an assumption of generous time with the children for both mother and father instead the more ad hoc family resolution scheme favoured by the department for education and skills will go ahead parents who apply to court for contact orders will be encouraged to go to mediation to try to agree their own arrangements within two weeks instead of waiting weeks for a court hearing but mediation is voluntary and unless both parents agree it will not take place tony coe president of the equal parenting council said the initiative was doomed to failure and parents should have a legal presumption of contact with their children he added it isnt going to make as far as we can see any practical difference we need simplicity so everybody knows the moment they go to court the court is going to be aiming towards a shared parenting plan unless there is a genuine reason why that should not take place if a parent is violent or abusive mediation is all well and good and we are all supportive of mediation but it is of no value if you dont have the authority of the court behind it the minister for children margaret hodge and the family justice minister lord filkin also announced an additional m for child contact services including funding of new contact centres and the introduction of new forms to ensure judges are aware of accusations or incidents of domestic violence at the start of cases jim parton of families need fathers described the family resolution scheme as watered down and ineffectual fathers justice whose members dress as superheroes to stage protests on cranes said the pilot was cynical and an absolute sham matt oconnor the groups founder said from our point there are no good points he added that to make matters worse the children and family court advisory and support service cafcass would be involved in administering the scheme cafcass was heavily criticised by the commons constitutional affairs committee last year it found there were serious failings in the organisation which was unable to cope with the demand for its services a spokesman for the department for education and skills stressed the scheme was a pilot which would

domestic abusers are much more likely to commit other crimes but police are failing to make crucial connections according to metroplitan police research a study of offences and perpetrators mostly men discovered that at least of those who had physically assaulted partners had a criminal history around one in had sexual convictions or there was intelligence that they had been been involved in other rapes or sexual assaults of those who had sexually abused a partner one in four were committing offences outside the home and one in eight were considered highly dangerous yet only of those who had raped or sexually assaulted a partner were on the national dna database laura richards a senior behavioural consultant with the mets racial and violent crime taskforce said officers often did not swab domestic abusers for dna because consent rather than identification was at issue and they were not considering the offender as a suspect for other crimes but she said it was vital for detectives to realise that men who beat up or raped wives or girlfriends were also good candidates for stranger rapes she pointed to a large number of murderers who had a history of physical sexual or psychological domestic abuse the soham killer ian huntley graham coutts who strangled brighton teacher jane longhurst barry george who shot jill dando and serial killer fred west there was also the recent case of m rapist antoni imiela who had previous convictions for burglary and assault who raped at least eight women and girls and was eventually caught through dna if youre violent in one context youre often violent in another said ms richards there is a definite link between domestic violence and stranger rape have the police really learned lessons from all these older cases such men she said were often serial perpetrators and skilled manipulators who went from one abusive relationship to another getting progressively more violent but also better at covering their tracks unfortunately the more contact perpetrators have with police and the criminal justice system the better they get at getting away with it she said although reporting of rape continues to rise by in convictions in england and wales are at a year low there are two domestic murders a week in england and wales and two a month in london accounting for a quarter of all homicides in the capital the met receive calls a year about domestic violence about one every six minutes in many cases there has been a long history of abuse before a murder is committed but domestic assault and rape cases are difficult to bring to court with victims unwilling to testify or worried their children will be taken away from them ms richards argued that for this reason a standalone register for domestic offenders would not work even if domestic violence victims did not want to pursue a case police should use the intelligence gained to investigate other crimes even the most dangerous domestic perpetrators were often not monitored,2004-03,domestic abuser much likely commit crime police failing make crucial connection according metroplitan police research study offence perpetrator mostly men discovered least physically

working parents are in line for a tax subsidy worth as much as a year to help pay the cost of a childs nanny under a littlenoticed budget announcement this week from april next year employees will be able to ask their employers to issue childcare vouchers worth a week that is then deducted from the persons wages but free of income tax and national insurance this means that a basic rate taxpayer will obtain a subsidy of income tax and national insurance while a higher rate taxpayer will enjoy a subsidy worth even more until now britains army of unregistered nannies estimated at were going to be excluded from the scheme which initially was open only to approved and registered childminders but this week the chancellor indicated the rules will be changed to allow the vouchers to be used to pay nannies who can redeem the vouchers with companies such as sodexho and accor which are adminstering the scheme on behalf of employers both parents will be able to claim the vouchers so long as they are working in the event of both parents being higher rate taxpayers the total value of the subsidy could easily surpass ruth powell a mother of two young children and parttime clinical negligence lawyer from south london is precisely the sort of person who will be in line to benefit from the new scheme she earns a year and her husband anthony evans earns more from his own business selling boat chandlery but paying for a nanny sets them back nearly a year id say we are doing all right but i do resent the fact that such a large chunk of my salary is used to pay for childcare and i effectively pay tax twice on that amount ms powell says the couple employ a parttime nanny to look after their sons milo aged seven months and finlay who is three our nannys gross salary on which tax and national insurance has to be paid comes out of my net salary which has already been taxed that does not seem right so this new scheme will at least give me some sort of assistance with childcare costs childcare vouchers are not new they have enjoyed an national insurance subsidy for some time and last december paymaster general dawn primarolo said they would also enjoy relief from income tax after april whats new is the inclusion of nannies under the voucher scheme the government said this week that it will carry out consultation this summer on how best to set up a voluntary registration scheme for nannies and once that is in place then nannies will be able to apply for accreditation and then be eligible under the childcare voucher system one drawback is that the scheme is employer based though the scheme does not come into force until working parents who employ nannies need to encourage employers to sign up now helen harvey of nannytaxcouk which provides payroll and other services for people with nannies says everyone who is paying for childcare ought to ask their employer to set up a childcare voucher scheme the vouchers form part of an increasingly valuable set of government measures to help parents with children the increase in the child element of the tax credit system will benefit low income families by as much as per month from april rises in child

ministers are poised to jettison part of a plan to cut the number of bitter and protracted court battles between parents over child contact the department for constitutional affairs was to pilot early intervention this year under which separating parents would be presented with parenting plans from which to choose based on an idea that has reduced the number of court battles over children in the us the templates would give both divorced parents generous time with their children now the initiative has been taken over by the department for education and skills but its model under consideration is a more ad hoc scheme by which parents would be helped by mediation to work out their own plans those who favour the usstyle plans who include some judges say mediation has been tried already with little success mediation is voluntary and mothers determined to frustrate their expartners attempts to see their children are unlikely to cooperate the apparent change of plan is a severe blow to fathers groups which have resorted to increasingly desperate stunts up to of divorced fathers lose contact with their children altogether fathers who have dressed as action figures to scale bridges and buildings including the royal courts of justice in london have moved the issue up the agenda police have had to deal with traffic disruption and threats to public order while protesters who had dressed as batman robin superman and spiderman face criminal prosecution for climbing the clifton suspension bridge in bristol judges admit the system does not work with the court battles more than doubling in years prince charles was moved to comment on the issue this week the system seemed unfair to divorced fathers and weighted towards mothers he said during a discussion with servicemen while on an official visit to a naval welfare association the early intervention project drawn up by a group including officials and judges aimed to bring parents together from the point of separation and help them to reach agreement parents would be helped to deal with the anger left over from their relationship in an attempt to eliminate obstacles to cooperation they would be taught how to handle the problems of postdivorce parenting and be told of the psychological harm that parental battles or being deprived of one parent can do to children the group now responsible for the initiative met for the first time this week some involved in the discussions are said to be concerned that usstyle templates conflict with the principles of the children act which requires the courts to consider the best interests of the child hamish cameron a child psychiatrist who supports the initial plan said what you do is you present these parenting plans which are different sorts of weekly schedules and say you choose the one that suits you best if it doesnt work well modify it whereas if you start with a blank slate its hopeless you have oh he can have the child once a month or alternate saturdays youve got to have some kind of template of what the state considers reasonable the florida statute says that parents should have continuing and regular contact with their children and that includes half the holidays alternate weekends and a midweek overnight stay thats a guideline and of course its not always possible but such a template means substantial contact for the child,2004-03,minister

the higher education sector could be plunged into crisis unless young women are given more encouragement to aim for top jobs in academia where their sex remain seriously underrepresented the head of the universities umbrella group warned last night in a hardhitting speech lady warwick said there were negative knockon effects for public life if higher education continued to be perceived as a maledominated culture with limited opportunities and challenges for women her analysis of the gender split showed that of the heads of higher education institutions which include universities as well as specialist colleges only are women while there are only women vicechancellors of universities of the total at professorial level women are particularly badly represented in senior jobs in science and engineering lady warwick said but even where they were better represented in softer subjects such as the arts and humanities their numbers still failed to reflect the huge proportion of woman studying these areas overall women tend to be involved in teaching and learning rather than research and are more involved in pastoral care than their male colleagues lady warwick who is the chief executive of universities uk was giving the barbara diamond memorial lecture held each year on the issue of women and equality to an audience of educationalists at the university of westminster in london she said despite many government initiatives since labours election victory of aimed at raising the profile of the equality and diversity agenda there was a long way to go in this changed environment standards and expectations of fairness and equality of opportunity have been raised she said academia cannot isolate itself from the real world and pursue learning exclusively it must legitimise itself by reflecting the society it serves the underrepresentation of women had enormous knockon effects for the rest of society the promotion of women is not just of importance to the higher education sector it has implications for the wider community when there is a small number of women in senior positions there is a small number of women who are qualified to join outside bodies this produces a spinoff effect which leads to unbalanced royal commissions representation on governing bodies of public service providers and so on the level of representation of women at the top level in higher education institutions was not atypical of the public sector she added but even in the civil service jobs in the equivalent of professorial level one down from permanent secretary were more within the reach for women even when women in highpowered jobs sat on senior committees they tended to be concerned with student welfare or teaching and learning these are not the bigexpenditure highprestige committees like planning and resources or research women do not then gain the experience of allocating and managing large budgets and of being involved in making the strategic decisions that would enable them to take the next step up within the institution family responsibilities were also an issue she said and while women should not have to choose between their careers and their families the long hours culture as well as the need to publish attend conferences to network both nationally and internationally make it very much more difficult for the person who bears the main burden of responsibilities at home the sector had to take steps to ensure it did not deter the women leaders of the future if we dont encourage these young women it may well leave us with a sector in crisis and unable to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of students expected to pass through the system in the coming years it isnt any good for us if higher education is perceived as being a maledominated culture we need diversity within the sector we need to encourage as much new blood and as many of the sharpest minds as we can and if these people are being turned off and going into industry and other sectors it will be damaging ultimately to the country as a whole,2004-03,higher education sector could plunged crisis unless young woman given encouragement aim top job academia sex

one of the most chilling statements on the helpcard we have devised is if you leave try to take all your children with you if you can for the average woman to imagine having to go without her children is impossible but ive known women who have had to jump out of windows for their safety and theyre not going to jump with their children in britain domestic violences cost to health and social services has been estimated at more than bn a year and every year in england and wales around women and children spend at least one night in a refuge under the crime and disorder act the nhs was made a mandatory partner in reducing crime and this put domestic abuse more firmly on the agenda i have strategic responsibility for defining mansfield primary care trusts response to domestic abuse and i have a broad training and education remit ive worked as a nurse a midwife and a health visitor and i did my masters degree in psychotherapy so i thought i had the right combination of skills for this post when it was created in ive also been a magistrate for years so i know something about how the legal system works nurses and other health professionals see women all the time and frontline staff need to have guidelines on how to deal with the problem as the biggest employer of women in britain some of those women in the nhs are going to be victims of domestic abuse themselves and we need to address that what i devised was a card that has a whole range of numbers that women can contact including womens aid the samaritans childline and solicitors theres also a safety assessment tool on the card with advice such as if you leave try to take some money for taxis try to take your medical card and passport that is the sort of practical advice that women need the average woman is not going to admit that abuse is taking place so health professionals will ask questions related to their home life and make statements that we hope they will respond to rather than asking direct questions if women say they dont need the helpcard we say thats good but why dont you keep it because maybe youve got a friend or neighbour who might need it so what were asking women to do is become health advocates for others it might be the first time that anyones suggested that they do anything to help themselves i once gave the card to a lawyer a very articulate woman and she told me later that she felt it was a very therapeutic thing to have done because she took from that that i thought she was capable of making her own decision were not in the business of rescue operations that could be dangerous womens aid is the expert in that field so we would refer women at risk to them or to the police on average a woman is beaten times before her first call to the police one woman in four is physically abused by a partner during her lifetime and one woman in nine is severely beaten by her male partner each year according to research a buse can also have a devastating impact on children in of domestic violence incidents children were in the same or the next room its a total misconception when people say he may have abused his partner but he was adoting father it has a direct effect on the children one of my roles is to facilitate better links with the police and health professionals when domestic abuse occurs the assaults become more severe and the times between assaults become shorter so the police are conscious that many of their callouts are people who have been assaulted before theyre keen to look at how they can riskassess we are talking about how we might work more effectively together what sort of information might safely be shared and how we could develop a more cohesive response we run a project with the local hospitals aampe department where some women go for medical help after being abused often they are accompanied so we cant talk to them openly we make information available through the cards and they can contact us later i visit womens prisons to talk about how they can deal with problems of domestic abuse when released ive been to many nhs trusts around the country to tell them about what were doing and theyre very keen to hear about it i also liaise with sure start projects magistrates and womens refuges the crucial thing is that we as health professionals provide the right information to vulnerable women and tell them where they can

women labour mps are as angry as other labour mps and party members at clare short better clare short than the politics of yahandboo march it has nothing to do with clares gender it has everything to do with her irresponsible behaviour the idea that the alternative to yahboo politics is the sort of personalised hate campaign being waged by clare short against tony blair is frankly puerile clare gave the game away last october when she told the guardian i want him to feel so unhappy that he makes an inelegant departure personal attacks and vendettas are the stuff of the oldstyle maledominated politics not the alternative to it jackie ashley then writes off the raft of what she calls femalefriendly polices because the cabinet feels less feminised than the wilson ones well it doesnt feel that way to me it is no accident that so much of new labours programme has been designed to help women these are policies that have been driven by a labour government more in tune with the concerns of women than any of its predecessors this is not just because there are more labour women in parliament and in the cabinet it is because of the culture change that has happened within labour politics jackie should consider the selection as labours candidate for blaenau gwent of maggie jones a leading woman trade unionist from an allwoman shortlist and ask herself whether she really believes this culture shift hasnt happened where jackie is right is that the advance of women in labour needs to be based on more than a numbers game but it also needs to be based on more than the self indulgence disloyalty and displays of personal bitterness at which clare short has become such an expert lorna fitzsimmons mp chair of plp womens committee labours women mps have been more successful in getting promoted into government than their male peers while those on the backbenches have feminised the parliamentary agenda in the parliament labours women signed womens early day motions to a greater extent than its men on issues such as rape violence against women abortion contraception and equal rights there were significant differences between the behaviour of labours women and men so they havent managed to turn the house upside down but their failure to end willyjousting should be blamed on those mps predominantly men who like to do politics machostyle many of labours women want to do politics differently but they are made to feel alien uncomfortable and other dr sarah childs author new labours women mps before the lynching party egged on by the prime minister arrives to string her up it is only right and proper that there is placed on the public record the enormously good work that clare short did as secretary of state for international development from to i write as one involved in working in developing countries mainly in africa often on behalf of dfid clare short created dfid under her watch two influential white papers were produced which in many respects set the scene for aid and development for many countries in the eu she was very highly regarded by her colleagues in europe and more importantly by many ministers and officials in developing countries especially in africa who valued her commitment and plain speaking if the prime minister has any credibility in africa to launch his commission on africa it is very largely due to clare shorts efforts

pregnancyrelated dismissals ought to be the most straightforward of sex discrimination cases but unfortunately they arent employment tribunals look at about cases of unfair dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy every year and this figure alone suggests the issue is far from simple only complex cases get as far as a tribunal proper if you include those which are settled before this point and the ones which are never brought because the potential applicant is too dispirited the problem becomes much bigger why should it be so unfair dismissals over pregnancy will usually show a much clearer line of cause and effect than other cases all is going well you get pregnant you tell your boss you are fired shortly afterwards the equal opportunities commission claims that employment tribunals are not as helpful to pregnant women as they could be the requirement that cases be brought within three months for example coincides with the time a pregnant woman will have other things on her mind than legal disputes the average compensation awarded for unfair dismissal is about of the average compensation paid in other types of case these facts together with the individual examples of brutal behaviour to pregnant women should make all mothers angry but employers have their grievances too the eoc in an ongoing survey of employers attitudes found a woman who runs a small business and felt intimidated by the law into keeping on an employee who took six months sick leave during her pregnancy a hard case but the eocs argument that since it costs an average to replace a worker it is more economical to retain a pregnant worker than sack her does not really stand up the costs to an employer of having an employee on maternity leave are not zero and it is doubtful whether the costs of replacing a young worker amount to but there is no magic sum which covers the cost of behaving decently it is just something we ought to do human nature keeps lawyers in business but a few more

if it works out for kaireece jacqueline denton says i will definitely be free to look for a job kaireece is her twoyearold and he has just started two mornings and two afternoons a week at the edmonton green sure start daycare unit she could not have put it better if the treasury had scripted it married with two young children ms denton is using labours childcare expansion as a springboard back into the labour market she used to work in customer services even better from gordon browns point of view she is clued up on tax credits and knows that if she does work there will be money available to help defray the costs of kaireeces care if enfield is typical parents know a lot more about tax credits and entitlements than they did when we spoke to them a year ago but ms denton and the parents we interview below also expose some of the dilemmas facing labour in delivering better childcare ms denton is in the same position as thousands of other mothers in enfield and elsewhere if childcare is near at hand affordable and reliable they might be able to look for jobs but so far new places have been slow in coming on stream and labour has concentrated resources on poorer areas such as edmonton green one result has been that childcare has lacked the salience it might have if betteroff parents were involved and pushed it up the political agenda according to the national audit office nearly childcare places have been created for preschool children since but the nao is worried that this new provision may not last and it says while considerable progress has been made in closing the gap in relative levels of provision between the poorest areas and others there is still some way to go you can see that national picture in miniature in enfield during the past year about childcare places have been added putting the borough within sight of its target of extra places between and but only of them are in daycare in creches or with childminders where preschool children can be looked after while parents are out at work the rest are mostly in clubs for schoolchildren for example running for an hour or so after or pm enfield may differ from the national picture in that its poorer areas may have more childcare than the affluent parts of a borough where until recently there was not much of a tradition of nursery schooling or childcare one reason is the experimental sure start project in the shopping mall at edmonton green enfields poorest ward this is the central governmentfunded scheme intended to focus help on disadvantaged preschool children to try to improve their potential when they reach school age sure start was not originally intended to be part of labours daycare programme but the unit at edmonton green is going great guns it used to offer just sessional care to parents attending parenting language smoking cessation and confidencebuilding classes but now it is making a virtue of assisting families who want to get into work and is itself acting as a focus for regenerating a rundown area if bryan hutton is representative sure start is putting down roots and binding a fissiparous neighbourhood together the manager of a bar he initially came along to sure start events with his daughter lauryn who is now four then he started volunteering now thanks to sure start money he is employed by enfield parents centre a voluntary group to advise residents on how to become effective members of the sure start board sure start does make a difference says sally johnson chief executive of the enfield primary care trust which employs extra health visitors in edmonton green it is able to help people who are operating from an incredibly low base one young single mother told us she was frightened to go the local park she didnt have the resources to use other leisure activities sure start was the only she felt she could go but sure start has its problems residents in its catchment area come and go rapidly sally johnson says churning is a problem all the preventative services face we make contact with a family but then they are gone the borough chief executive rob leak says this is an enfieldwide issue the boroughs population is very mobile and that can penalise us in terms of grants population is also growing up over the past four years but a lot of our funding is fixed on older historic levels and there can be a lag of years before it adjusts a team from the treasury was here recently and we agreed with them that if you want to target spending you need quality information about where people are sure starts director laxmi jamdagni left recently according to one local observer there is bound to be a degree of disruption though maybe new people can revitalise the project sure starts funds start tapering off in the coming financial year and no one seems to know where the money to pay for its relatively generous levels of staffing will be found yet sure start is being taken as the model for the childrens centres labour says it wants to create as it expands childcare in poor areas enfield has put in a bid to the department for education and skills for five centres in the south and east of the borough there are political implications to all this enfield council is controlled by the conservatives whose electoral bases are the betteroff wards our challenge mr leak says is to get money into deprived areas while in the welloff areas we ensure resources are used efficiently conservative councillors are concerned to make sure we have one society in extremis social cohesion breaks down and there is evidence to suggest antisocial behaviour and crime thrive if people are unemployed and dont feel they have a part in society this administration is very keen to make sure all enfield people have a good chance in life but we are also working hard to demonstrate to as it were the paying customers that we are using their money well improving our basic ways of doing business working closely with the voluntary sector and the health service to avoid duplication labour is considering how much it would cost to make childrens centres universal so that all parents have access to affordable care stephen burke of the daycare trust is optimistic the childrens minister margaret hodge has been trying to persuade the chancellor gordon brown and the prime minister to make childcare a theme for a third labour term it is impossible not to notice the enthusiasm that enters her voice as eve stickler the councils early years and child development manager imagines a string of centres right across the borough offering wrap around care along with integrated health education and child protection services they could be attached to primary schools schools would be good places to link with since they already offer a universal service it is very important to avoid stigmatising child care of course universal childcare would be costly a backoftheenvelope calculation for enfield indicates capital costs of m to convert primary schools adding space for cots and play areas add to that the annual cost of nursery staff assuming they can be recruited and ms stickler says this is critical subsidies which would make childcare affordable that would require money in addition to the element intended to cover childcare costs in the tax credit payable to families on low to moderate incomes whose parents are in work annual revenue costs for universal childcare in enfield would be around m that is a gross figure the exchequer would benefit from extra taxes if parents returned to work and at present parents pay about of the costs of care for preschoolers subsidies and benefits covering the rest in other eu countries it is no one is talking about free childcare except for poor families but a key question is how big the parents copayments for care should be enfield reports recent improvement in the rate at which women are coming forward as childminders getting approvals for them and other people working with children from the criminal records bureau is still proving slow but relations with the office for standards in education which regulates nurseries are much better there is some way to go although in principle the borough will offer all parents of threeyearolds free nursery education for twoandahalf hours a day this year only about threequarters of those eligible are taking it up no one quite knows how much latent demand there is for childcare and how many parents might think of seeking jobs if affordable care were available what the parents say childcare gives me time to

benefits will remain restricted the workforce perhaps the area that we know least about is the attitude of the future labour force if our mature workforce will no longer undertake traditional agricultural work for instance will future workers also refuse to do other kinds of jobs will we for example be able to meet the growing demand for care workers in the past many people stayed in jobs they did not like to support their families and pay the mortgage when young workers cannot afford to buy a house and start families far later will their attitude to work also change a question of

the oecd but the picture is more complicated and less rosy than that half of graduates were earning under in a survey of people who graduated in conducted by the institute for employment studies many graduates were surprised how difficult it was to find work especially good quality jobs say the researchers so most graduates start off with temporary jobs and many of them will take a while to get into jobs expected to be filled by graduates the government wants per cent of young people to achieve a higher education qualification from so there has to be an effect on salaries under the laws of

patricia hewitt the womens minister in cabinet yesterday warned that pressure was building across government and among labour mps to revert to what she describes as a form of latenight harddrinking yah boo politics that would leave the public even more disengaged from parliament such a move would be a disaster for the cause of public service reform the modernisation of parliament and working women ms hewitts comments come after one woman labour mp jane griffiths accused elements of her local party of sexism after it chose to remove her as its candidate at the next election at the weekend ms griffiths also claimed she had been sexually harassed at westminster speaking to the guardian ms hewitt admitted there was a serious groundswell of pressure across government to revert to the latenight parliamentary sittings hours with some claiming the recent disaffected mood among labour mps has been caused by the end to latenight sittings a review of the twoyearold experiment led by the commons modernisation committee is under way following a demand from mps from all parties especially older male labour mps in remarks that will infuriate some in the parliamentary labour party she said there are several of us that think going back to the th century working hours would be a disaster she added the sight of mps voting at oclock at night with mps often the worse for wear debating and voting only confirms parliament is in another world and it is not part of any normal world most people think you cannot make a decision late at night particulary after a good meal late night politics and the yah boo that goes with it puts off a lot of potential women candidates and the wider public they just think it is a life that they dont want to be part of she said politics will only reengage with society if parliament in terms of the number of women ethnic minorities and young people reflects modern society she attacked as disgraceful the recent decision of brent east constituency labour party to keep shahid malik a wellknown labour activist off the short list for the parliamentary nomination it sends out messages she said even though the local party had eventually selected an asian woman ms hewitt also disclosed that a survey of prospective parliamentary candidates conducted by the plp womens committee had shown what she described as real shock from many prospective parliamentary candidates at the idea of reverting to the old hours she said if having bitten on the bullet of reform we now retreat because it is uncomfortable and difficult for those that are used to the old ways then we undermine our whole case for public service reform she argued that mps would be condemned as hypocritical recalling the longer the firemens dispute went on the more we discovered what was going on with the working practices in the fire service firemen had clearly developed and built their lives round a pattern of working that enabled a lot of them to have second jobs for men as well as women the commons should be part of the normal world she said rather than a throwback to the th century when men who worked in the city and the law courts by day would run the country with a good bottle of wine in the evening she said reversion to the old hours would be a defeat for the advocates of a decent worklife balance we as a government introduced new laws a year ago to make it easier for parents to balance work and family if we bottle it now as a parliament we are sending a message to business and the whole economy she dismissed suggestions that the rebelliousness of mps had been fostered by the lack of opportunity for mps to socialise together and discuss politics ahead of latenight votes she said ministers had to listen to backbenchers more closely but she did not think labour mps could discuss politics only when they are corralled together for latenight votes,2004-03,patricia hewitt womens minister cabinet yesterday warned pressure wa

highachieving female executives are turning to the bottle because of growing frustration about the glass ceiling which they feel is holding back their careers a study published today found that women in senior positions were more likely to have a drink problem than their male peers and were turning to the bottle far more often than less successful women jenny head from university college london who led the study said one possible reason might be that its the stress of working against a glass ceiling the study found that women in highly paid highly pressured jobs were three times more likely to be alcohol dependent than those in the lowestgrade jobs but mens vulnerability to drinking did not alter as they climbed up the career ladder the findings reported in the journal occupational and environmental medicine are based on questionnaire responses from about civil servants working in different departments in london twothirds of those taking part in the whitehall study were men participants were asked about the demands of their job levels of support at work and at home and the degree to which they could make and influence decisions they were questioned about the effort they made and the rewards they received in terms of promotional prospects questions relating to attitudes and behaviour were used to determine those who had a drink problem between and of men interviewed were found to be alcohol dependent no matter what kind of job they did but it was a different story for women only of those working in the lowest clerical grades had a drink problem compared with of senior executives for men there was a significant association between drinking to excess and putting in a lot of effort for little reward but this did not seem to be important for women lack of scope for making decisions was also associated with problem drinking in women despite the apparent conflict with the pattern observed in female executives the study found there was no direct link between high work demands and alcohol dependence in men or women nor did the effect of work on home life seem to be a significant factor although ms head thought it might be more relevant to women it is possible that women have more conflicting roles as they try to strike the balance between work and home she said we hope to go on to look for some of the explanations for these findings the charity alcohol concern said last night that the results reflected a trend seen in other studies women who earn more and are at the top of the occupational scale do seem to drink more than women lower down the scale said a spokeswoman for the charity it could be to do with struggling against the glass ceiling they have to put so much effort into getting to the top of the pile that it makes life more stressful what we would say is a bit worrying is that here are women who are highflyers skilled competent and educated yet who feel that alcohol is the way to deal with stress they dont seem to be aware of the downside she said there had been a clear increase in the number of british women drinking above sensible limits over the past years the proportion had risen from in the early s to about in ms head said maybe also women in higher grades are operating in a bit of a mans world and perhaps feel they need to adopt some male roles but this is just speculation,2004-03,highachieving female

grandparents and other homebased carers should be paid if they look after children stephen byers the former cabinet minister and blairite outrider said yesterday parents who employ nannies should also receive state help in recognition that this form of childcare is often the only kind suitable for those working irregular hours however parents should make a financial contribution to earlyyears childcare if they are judged to be able to afford it writing in tribune the leftwing weekly mr byers said labour needed to rethink its national childcare strategy and move beyond the current highly targeted approach both he and his fellow blairite excabinet colleague alan milburn have said the government should try to help all parents rather than ploughing money into the surestart programme aimed at the poorest of council wards in the country all three political parties recognise that childcare is of increasing concern to voters and the promise of financial help could woo parents labour which since easter has guaranteed a nursery place for every threeyearold is expected to put childcare at the centre of its programme for a third term with its manifesto likely to include proposals for childrens centres in deprived areas offering fulltime education for underfives but middleincome families many of whom voted labour in will be unaffected by this and would welcome financial help british parents pay the highest childcare bills in europe said mr byers with a place for a twoyearold costing a year places in london are closer to mr byers who is advising mr blair on the manifesto said there was a childcare lottery in this country with access to childcare depending on where families live level of income and who they work for the reality of the present situation is that we still have too many children missing out on the benefits of quality childcare if we are serious about providing universal childcare so that all parents have a genuine choice at a price they can afford then we need to rethink the national childcare strategy he said one of the best ways of ensuring every child had an equal start was to care for children from different economic groups in the same place warning that universal provision would be expensive he said copayment mentioned by the prime minister and the childrens minister margaret hodge could be introduced so that betteroff parents would contribute to the places which would still cost less than the private sector whilst places would be free to those on a low income it would be reasonable to expect an incomerelated financial contribution from those who can afford it he added,2004-04,grandparent homebased carers paid look child stephen byers former cabinet minister blairite outrider said yesterday parent employ nanny also

i dont vote along with of the population at the last election ive always thought that feminism was just as important an intellectual revolution as marxs and freuds and yet i fail to use the right to vote that women died fighting for over a century ago i tried once i put on flat shoes to walk to a school building in a back street i never knew existed and stood behind a tacky curtain with a pen on a piece of string to tick a name id never heard of because i live in a nojunkmail mansion block and im never at home when politicians doorstop i have a life the electoral commissions gender and political participation report has found that women are turned off by voting for men im not surprised of course wed prefer to vote for women when most of the men are so outstandingly awful if political parties do want to reengage the disengaged candidates from different backgrounds and genders who look and talk like normal people would be a good start no one wants to struggle to a polling station just to tick the none of the above box and women especially are attuned to that concept so loved by market researchers value for time but this wouldnt be enough to make nonvoters like me change our ways make it as easy as sending a text then we might and make it compulsory i have no objection to being made to vote by the state as long as its as convenient as a ready meal growing up in australia where voting is compulsory i took my right more seriously there turning is equated with fullyfledged legitimate drinking driving and voting as a part of the comingofage package this social and personal conditioning sticks with you like springbreak nostalgia ergo youre not a grownup if you dont vote but once its compulsory politicians must learn to speak our language its not clever going door to door ringing our bells were not there and even if we were we dont answer the door to strange men in shinybaggy suits where we navigate our lives is online and via mobile while once we may have written a letter to a newspaper editor now we email anyone who wants to listen or just pick up a handset people who no longer feel connected have found other ways of being connected and this is where the powersthatberatherthando must shift themselves while some people are calling for radical steps since publication of the electoral commission reports findings and the boring old debate about

when it comes to politics men it appears are a turnoff a study of gender and political participation revealed yesterday seventyfive years after gaining the franchise women are significantly more likely to turn out and vote if they are represented by a woman than a man and are more likely to become involved in an electoral campaign on behalf of a female candidate they also feel a far greater connection with government are more likely to be interested in an election and are more likely to discuss politics yet if they are represented by a male mp they feel deactivated found the research conducted by the electoral commission the report gender and political participation destroys the myth that women are less likely to turn out to national regional or local elections than men pointing out that levels of turnout are statistically comparable and it points out that women are more likely to be involved in causeorientated activities such as signing a petition or boycotting products for ethical reasons but when it comes to involvement in campaignorientated activities such as contacting a politician donating money to or working for a political party women are significantly less likely to be involved according to the research by academics at harvard and birkbeck college london at the last election turnout among women voters was higher than among men where a woman mp was elected women are also less interested in an election when a male mp is standing and less likely to work for a male candidate women are deactivated by there being a male mp said rosie campbell of birkbeck one of the reports authors women are also much more likely to agree with the statement that government benefits me if represented by a woman compared to in constituencies with a male mp the research conducted for the body charged with looking at how to increase voter turnout suggests womens participation can be boosted by the introduction of postal voting and the provision of more conveniently located polling stations women also have lower confidence in their ability to influence the political process through their own actions though the activism gap diminishes once women are educated to degree level according to the findings the gap increases among ethnic groups with black women being less likely to vote than black men and among lowerincome households the research will worry all three main parties each of which are seeking to boost voter turnout at a record low of at the last election and curb political disillusionment it will also intensify pressure on the conservatives and liberal democrats to introduce forms of positive action to boost their number of women mps both parties have ruled out womenonly shortlists favoured by labour in favour of increased training for aspiring candidates mentoring and with the tories in six cases primary elections the fawcett society which lobbies for womenonly shortlists backed the commissions calls for more measures to increase female turnout katherine rake its director stressed radical steps must be taken to prevent participation in elections falling yet further yesterday matthew taylor the liberal democrat chairman said that each party should be chastened by the report as he admitted the lib dems six women mps were insufficient as were the five women candidates in the partys top target seats eleanor laing the tories womens spokeswoman maintained her partys opposition to womenonly shortlists insisting its like saying men can swim but women always need to wear waterwings the party has introduced new methods to encourage more candidates in the last months but while it has female candidates standing at the next election only two are in its top target seats the labour chairman ian mccartney said the reports finding meant the selection of more women was crucial and challenged the lib dems and tories to match labours record partly as a result of womenonly shortlists labour had women mps and female ministers how the parties line up labour women mps of the parliamentary party women ministers five at cabinet level of approved candidates at the next election are women with a further nine women to

the electoral commission represented by three women launched its analysis of womens participation in politics yesterday in the presence of representatives from the three main uk parties all men the commissions dramatic evidence of women mps beneficial effects on democracy should unsettle anyone who has ever argued against positive discrimination provoked by plummeting turnouts to scout around for ways to reinvigorate our ailing political system it has already reported on alienation among younger voters and ethnic minorities the commission has established that slightly more than half the electorate aka women prefer causes to campaigns action to meetings and are more likely to be drawn in to political activity in support of another woman most tellingly they are more satisfied with the effectiveness of government if their mp is a woman women it must be deduced find the way other women speak to them more persuasive a triumph perhaps for the women ministers who warn of the damaging impact of applying the language of war to domestic politics although many in politics have long been aware of these trends its why women suddenly reemerge on political platforms as elections approach

so its official there is a gender gap across most aspects of political life but women are more engaged when there is a female mp my first reaction was that the electoral commission had succeeded in stating the bleedin obvious but this is a very useful piece of work which backs up what women in political life have long suspected this is not some righton girlie organisation banging the feminist drum this is the electoral commission an organisation taken seriously by the chaps the easy conclusion to draw was that we need more female mps the less easy bit is to decide how to achieve that the really easy bit is to endlessly discuss the problem something all the male mps at the launch expressed a will to do get real boys the time for talking is past what are you going to do the labour party has introduced allwoman shortlists with some success i support such lists but this is not my partys position the liberal democrats established the gender balance taskforce to provide training and mentoring for prospective female candidates while i chaired the group we extended our remit to look at barriers to participation for many years i conformed to some of the stereotypes highlighted in the report i was involved with a nonpolitical campaigning organisation and my local community when the political activism switch was triggered i joined the lib dems and got involved i was later told that the local men had decided that i would be a good organiser because i had children i then started to deviate from the norms and became a local councillor when people mentioned westminster i just laughed i couldnt see what i had in common with the middleaged middleclass men who appeared to dominate the place i then met a few and realised we desperately needed more women in parliament i could not complain if i wasnt prepared to be involved the rest is history i do have the best job in the world it isnt all public speaking and political catfighting which are two factors women find offputting we need to talk about the positive satisfying side of the job so ladies next time you hear a male mp whingeing about his lot lighten him of his burden if politics is to reengage with the

tony blair will today confirm that labour is planning to offer a new right to flexible working for up to five million carers looking after elderly parents infirm relatives or close friends the new right to request flexible working hours or parttime work from an employers mirrors the successful introduction of the same request rights already granted to parents of young children mr blair will float the further extension of the right to carers when he speaks on gmtv today he has been under pressure to do more about the battle which many face to juggle the pressures between work and home responsibilities at a big conversation meeting in downing street yesterday mr blair said it is time for us to look at how we can better support carers an ageing population coupled with womens employment is creating growing pressure on people who are caring for an elderly parent or relative we have promised to review the impact of the legislation and make no further changes until after a review in but subject to that i believe that our priority should be to extend the right to request to work flexibly the idea has been championed by patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary she believes the evidence is that the right to request extra time off or more flexible working hours for young parents has been successful surveys conducted by the office of national statistics suggests that in eight out of cases employers have acceded to the request without disagreement the yearold right has applied to parents with children under six in legal terms the right has allowed young parents the opportunity to seek flexible working hours without any danger of dismissal employers for their part are required to show they have taken the request seriously downing street has been struck that adults are torn between their careers and nursing ailing parents there are growing signs that with an ageing population the state is not going to be able to provide all the care or even the necessary funding much evidence shows that ailing parents would prefer to stay at home with their family ms hewitt said the big question is do we continue to strengthen the protection and support we can give to parents with young children or should we think about extending what we have done to carers there are at least as many people looking after elderly or disabled relatives mr blairs involvement suggests he is determined to take up the issue even if nothing concrete is likely for a few years the equal opportunities commission has also supported granny leave but last night the

professional women are successfully challenging the established power of the old boy network by setting up new girl organisations to provide mutual career support according to a report today from the thinktank demos it found that women were often unintentionally disadvantaged by the flexible working arrangements that were supposed to help them juggle work and family life they missed out on afterhours socialising and so were denied entry to the informal networks that help men to bond and swap information about career opportunities the report girlfriends in high places was based on research into more than womens networks and a survey of professional women working mainly in the public sector the networks ranged from professional groupings such as women in management and women in journalism to organisational initiatives such as a project to bring together senior female civil servants fostered by the cabinet office about senior women working in government departments meet four or five times a year for lunchtime seminars they also signal their willingness to help each other by phone or email when genderrelated problems arise demos found that women benefited from networks that were more structured than the informal groupings that work for the men it was told by dame rennie fritchie the commissioner for public appointments women network differently from men they want to give as much as they receive its not about prospecting and getting out of it all you can get for yourself or for showing your face its about involvement and support and mutuality the report said women were often excluded from activity that might appear banal but had a powerful impact on progress in the organisation the study funded by five government departments found that small talk about football enabled men to bond before meetings women working flexible hours were not around for pub trips and they were often affected by big briefcase syndrome the need to carry their work in a bag big enough to pick up shopping on the way home helen mccarthy the author of the report said professional women were addressing this problem by setting up more formal networks that operate during working hours with the approval of employers in the public and private sectors britain was entering a new era of workbased networked feminism that suited the complex gender politics of big organisations with networks you can be sure that no ones checking your feminist credentials on the door she said its ok to want to get ahead and be successful but equally women want to help each other and they want a fairer deal as a group networked feminists recognise that having it all means acting to advance women collectively as well as realising their own personal goals the report came as the cabinet office published figures showing women held of top management posts in the civil service in october last year compared with in april over the same period the proportion of women in the senior civil service rose from to the government aims to increase this proportion to by demos said this target was unlikely to be met through conventional equal opportunities policies the government should rely more on the power of womens networking addressing the formal barriers to womens progression to senior positions is unlikely to be sufficient to tackle the unequal gender distribution of the civil service which is bottom heavy with women it said its survey of networked women found said the womenonly nature of the contact was a good reason to join but separatism was still a problem for many women and twothirds of the nonjoiners said the womenonly character of these organisations was the factor most likely to keep them away half the networked women said womens needs for professional development were not met by their employers more than a third said they gained in confidence through membership of a network the report quoted one unnamed senior woman civil servant who said at my level there arent many other women and its just very useful to be able to share experiences it can be tough for women at senior levels and its good to know that other women are going through the same thing how and why they get together aurora womens network selfproclaimed leading corporate and entrepreneurial womens network in europe it boasts members and as well as training and advice provides schmoozing

its a simple idea where everyone wins the high cost of childcare stops many unemployed parents from getting jobs or training so why not provide free childcare facilities while training those who want a career in childcare the east london childcare institute elci britains first dedicated childcare training centre was formally opened in stratford this month and aims to create around qualified childcare workers over the next five years there are about house holds in london in which no adult is working and so cannot afford to pay for childcare which in the capital costs up to more than in the rest of the country as a result parents are unable to take job and training opportunities and so remain in the unemployment and poverty trap chris leigh chief executive of newhambased newtech which runs elci says its a very straightforward solution to a complicated problem we try not to turn anyone away and can provide daytime evening and weekend courses from introductory national vocational qualifications up to foundation degree level students will be able to gain work experience in the centres own creche and we will also provide an agency offering locum cover so that fulltime staff from elsewhere can go on to further training and our students can gain valuable experience elci is aimed at unemployed or lowincome parents particularly those from newhams large asian community who are least likely to be able to afford childcare it will also provide careers advice for existing childcare workers and support for people wanting to set up a childcare business the scheme is funded by a m grant from the london development agency lda that included the cost of building the new centre plus m from the learning and skills council newham council and the european regional fund londons mayor ken livingstone says that if the scheme proves a success it could be replicated in other parts of the capital with lda and greater london authority funding the daycare trust a national childcare charity believes that if the government is serious about tackling unemployment in deprived areas then centres like the one in stratford should be incorporated in regeneration programmes across the country julies emmanuel is one of the first graduates of an eightweek pilot course run by elci in west ham on the gainsborough park estate where she lives taking her first granddaughter to school prompted her to think about the elci course and going into childminding as a career it was a bit like going back to school at first with all the paperwork and essays she says but now i am a registered childminder and i am also enrolled on an early years course she admits that initially it was a struggle coming off benefits and starting paid work and she needed transitionary help from social services to support her through the weeks of study when she was not working it was a slog at first but it was worth it because it has made me a happier person she says i now look after four

in the past few weeks the european court of justice has made two decisions which safeguard the rights of mothers on maternity leave the nub of both decisions is that mothers should not have to forfeit benefits they would have otherwise enjoyed just because they were away from work one case was homegrown the court finally reached a conclusion regarding michelle alabaster v woolwich building society and the secretary of state for social security albeit belatedly as alabaster became pregnant in in september of that year her six weeks of statutory maternity pay was calculated at of her earnings in december she was awarded a pay rise she assumed that her maternity pay would go up too but the powers that be decided to keep to the letter of the law which says that maternity pay is fixed according to earnings in the fifth and sixth month of pregnancy the court eventually disagreed with this interpretation by comparison the case of merino gomez v continental industrias has raced through the courts gomez took her maternity leave from may to august during that time continental industrias closed for its fourweek summer holiday when she returned she assumed she still had her holiday entitlement no said her employer you werent here you missed out gomez objected and took the company to court where it was held that annual leave and mater nity leave are separate it was irrelevant that gomez was on leave during the firms holiday period as was the fact that continental industrias holiday arrangements were the result of a collective agreement she should not forfeit her right to annual leave through pregnancy any more than alabaster should have lost six weeks of her pay rise the courts judgment should be the precedent that employment tribunals and ideally employers will follow from now on there is a backlog of similar cases waiting to be resolved on the basis of the courts decision hopefully few have been waiting as long as alabaster,2004-04,past week european court

men who commit domestic violence may be suffering a form of panic attack that they direct against their partners according to one of britains most respected experts in the field of domestic abuse dr elizabeth gilchrist will launch a fiveyear million research project later this year to attempt to prove her initial research findings which indicate that acts of domestic violence are a defence response to undetected panic attacks i am very clear that there is no excuse for domestic violence said gilchrist a forensic psychologist at coventry university who has worked with domestic violence offenders for years this is about looking for effective ways of intervention to make women and children safer im aware that our findings could initially look controversial but the failure of current treatment programmes to stop perpetrators reoffending is evidence enough that we need to look at the issue with fresh eyes gilchrists findings have been criticised by campaigners against domestic violence who fear they will be used by offenders to absolve them of responsibility for their crime this is exactly the sort of dangerous claim that is used by both offenders and victims of abuse to shift responsibility for the crime away from the perpetrator said linda regan of the child and women abuse studies unit at london metropolitan university if this is true then why dont the perpetrators hit their bosses and friends as well why is it only their partners who get attacked recent research on jailed offenders in america has found that those committing domestic violence experience sensations immediately before and during an act of violence similar to those felt by people having panic attacks the research carried out by dr david george at the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism also showed that the brain mechanisms of offenders that are activated during defensive aggression are similar to those triggered during a panic attack both gilchrist and the coauthor of her study dr ian mitchell a neuropsychologist at the university of birmingham believe offenders have one of two psychological profiles seventyfive per cent register as antisocial narcissists who attack women in order to exert power others are borderline dysphoric who abuse their partners in an unplanned spontaneous and reactive manner we need to have a full and frank discussion about domestic violence if we are ever going to have a chance of stopping it said gilchrist of course these men need to have a distorted view of women for a panic attack to result in physical aggression but that doesnt mean there isnt some further reason why their panic sparks such an extreme response the study which will focus on imprisoned offenders will first determine whether there is a subgroup of domestic violence perpetrators who are particularly susceptible to panic attacks if so gilchrist and mitchell will investigate whether there is a form of medical intervention that could suppress the likelihood of a panic attack triggering an aggressive reaction mitchell warns however that any treatment will be difficult to administer because panic responses are notoriously difficult to suppress and because over time they become more extreme so any treatment would need to be continually adjusted,2004-04,men commit domestic violence may suffering form panic attack direct partner according one

patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary will today float the idea of granny leave for employees who want to work fewer hours so that they can look after their parents she will also ask whether fathers ought to have more generously paid paternity leave or be entitled to more time off when she begins a wider debate on how the government might secure more familyfriendly employment policies working parents of children under six are allowed to request cuts in their working hours employers do not have to grant them but they have to show they have examined the request seriously nearly a million parents have now made such a request about a quarter of those who could do so but women outnumbered men by nearly four to one employers agreed to requests in of cases and compromises were reached in another im delighted that the new right has proved popular with both parents and employers on its first birthday ms hewitt is expected to tell the conference in london organised by the group fathers direct with more women in work than ever before employers cannot afford to ignore the benefits of flexible working including recruitment retention and staff morale employers have sent out a signal of support for flexible working and this should give more parents the confidence to raise the issue with their boss either informally or through the new right nearly a quarter of such parents in britain have made requests for flexible working a broad term which includes job sharing working from home and staggered hours according to the department of trade and industry more than half of parents with young children said that they were aware of the new rights which were introduced in april a survey of about employees found women with children under six were more likely to request flexible working than men the data revealed ms hewitt will also make clear the governments intention to make men more ready to take up the option and its intention to consider whether more job flexibility can be offered to carers fathers direct argues that more changes are needed employers should only be allowed to refuse applications for flexible working if they can prove it would damage

staff with elderly parents to care for could win the right to work fewer hours under radical plans to help britons juggle jobs and family life this granny leave would give adults torn between their careers and nursing ailing parents the right to request parttime work or flexible hours as parents of young children already can working fathers could have more generously paid paternity leave or even the right to up to six months off after a baby is born to encourage more male involvement in childrens lives chunks of leave currently available to either parent of young children could even be earmarked as menonly daddy months that could not be taken by the mother to send out a signal that fathers matter patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary will call tomorrow for a major national debate over what modern families really want though she told the observer we are going to have to work out what our priorities are the more rights and benefits we give mothers the more we reinforce the assumption that its the mother who is the parent that matters so should the priority be more rights for fathers higher pay for parental leave or a daddy month like they have in some

children in sweden any male politician who didnt take his full parental leave would just be out it would be unthinkable you would be seen as a bad father she said targeting fathers however risks alienating some womens groups who say mothers still need most help when you have women on low incomes forced to go back to work when their babies are six months old because they cant afford to take any more leave there is a question about whether that money should be going to parents as a whole or to mothers said liz kendall director of the maternity alliance charity however jack osullivan of fathers direct said many men feared that taking the time off they wanted would wreck their career prospects he wants fathers to receive per cent of their normal pay during paternity leave flexible

divorcing parents will be diverted from court and helped to resolve their own child contact disputes with generous parenting time for both under a radical overhaul of the failing family justice system a green paper in june or july will outline proposals for parents to be taught how to put aside their own anger focus on the childrens best interests and negotiate a postseparation parenting plan a national helpline open day and night could help parents needing advice on how to make contact work the announcement comes a day after a high court family division judge mr justice munby delivered a blistering attack on the system which saw a father leave his court in tears after being driven to end a fiveyear battle to see his daughter which had involved court hearings lord filkin the family justice minister in the department of constitutional affairs yesterday promised a green paper before parliaments summer recess would set out a better system pilot projects in london brighton and sunderland to try out early intervention in contact disputes before they reach court are now expected to require parents to go to mediation instead of the original proposal to encourage mediation unveiled this month fathers groups had predicted that they would be doomed to failure because mothers who were determined to deny fathers contact would not agree to mediate lord filkin said the governments starting point was that children did not want to be involved in the middle of some ghastly fight adding we also are pretty clear that courts are not the best places to get people to change their behaviour although contact time would vary depending on the circumstances there would be clear expectations that both parents would have the time to form a meaningful relationship with the child that could mean agreeing usstyle parenting plans setting out weekly access we would be looking at a range of ways of trying to help parents shift their behaviour focus on the interests of the child get an understanding of how to go about negotiating with their former partner he said the term parenting classes was a turnoff he added but parental education of some kind was necessary lord filkin said the intention was to bear down on the most intractable cases there would be a range of court sanctions for parents who flouted court orders the minister said most of the changes envisaged would

a girl of severely depressed has become mute her only defence against parents who have fought over her for the past four years ever since their marriage failed she sits in a room with a mediator aware that her mother and father are watching behind a oneway mirror for the first time she is given the opportunity to say how she would like her parents to behave she breaks her silence to say she would like her father to stop hurting her and her mum and that he should talk to someone about his anger she also says her mother should stop calling her dad an evil pig and talk to someone about her sadness the mediator tells the parents they can take heed of their daughter or continue in the destruction of her life over several sessions their behaviour changes and they seek counselling to deal with what their daughter has laid bare a year later the child who has found her voice again writes a letter saying that her parents are doing well and thanking the mediator for listening to her point of view in the war between mothers and fathers the figure often erased from the picture is that of the child many adults are too shackled to their own hurt to place the needs of their offspring first professionals also often overlook the young in recent research children repeatedly said they had not been heard either by the family justice system or their parents in australia in the attorney generals department investigated its mediation and counselling services it too discovered that childrens views had been disregarded and professionals were resistant to change a sixmonth pilot project radically overhauled the system children such as the yearold were invited to testify to the impact of perpetual hostility parenting programmes to make adults more aware of the childs perspective were established and there was improved contact for nonresident parents the pilot proved a spectacular success and is being rolled out across australia in the uk vicky leach from the childrens charity the nch has tried for many months to raise government funding for a similar pilot here to no avail research underscores common sense children do better when a couple handle a separation as harmoniously as possible in practice a high proportion of children cease to see their fathers within two years some dads may be irresponsible and a danger a high proportion however are thwarted by mothers in the s in florida a system of therapeutic justice was established based on the twin premise that the childrens interests genuinely come first and the law should do no harm as a result a parent knows that unless there is abuse the courts will grant a nonresident parent access at least every other weekend and one evening a week in addition adults have to attend mediation and parenting classes as with the australian model these remind them that exorcising matrimonial demons in their offsprings presence and inventing reasons why daddy or mummy cant be seen this sunday is wounding the child mothers who refuse to comply with a contact order are jailed penalties have been imposed rarely the point of the florida endeavour is that no matter who has done what to whom the weapon of using the children is simply not available hence in a changed climate more parents try to resolve their problems in this country last year the organisation new approaches to contact composed of fathers academics and lawyers and with the backing of mrs justice bracewell an esteemed senior family court judge drew up a pilot early inter ventions project which adopted much of the florida template including the compulsory compliance of parents it would be incomprehensible if the pilot project did not receive official sanction mrs justice bracewell wrote it should produce much better outcomes for parents and children now the inconceivable has occurred last week the project was officially dumped instead the department for education and skills dfes under the childrens minister margaret hodge has its own very different pilot in which the involvement of parents will be voluntary a fatal flaw the team designing the detail of the dfes pilot to be launched in september has next to no voices representing childrens interests althea efunshile is chair of the dfes design team she writes it is a key aim to encourage parents to step back from the adult conflict and focus exclusively on the needs of their children both parents will be expected to work together draw up their own plan for cooperative parenting if it is that easy for a divorced couple to work together why the need for the pilot hostile parents wont cooperate simply because she and ms hodge have invited them to nor will this scheme achieve the necessary and vital cultural shift in short its a waste of time its not too late the early interventions pilot should be tried out even if it requires a change in the law to permit the compulsion of parents a pilot based on the australian findings also deserves to be funded to gauge if we

radical proposals to extend statutory paid maternity leave by a further six months and earmark a portion for fathers only under a socalled daddy leave scheme could feature in labours election manifesto for a third term in government it emerged last night the plan was floated in a speech by the childrens minister margaret hodge who said it would give working parents the chance to spend the crucial first year of their new babys life at home while recognising the important role of fathers who even with limited paid leave rarely take time off at this stage it is one of a series of initiatives being considered for inclusion in labours general election manifesto in a keynote speech to the social market foundation in london last night mrs hodge said labours determination to further improve early years and childcare services and develop more familyfriendly policies was driven by its belief in gender equality there was much talk about the rights of parents but not enough done to support both parents to exercise their rights and fulfil their responsibilities to their children mrs hodge said in my view we should be working towards parents having the opportunity to stay at home for the crucial first year of their childs life and that opportunity should be open to both fathers and mothers she added all the research confirms the important role fathers as well as mothers play in their childrens lives yet too few fathers take time out of work in the first year of their childs life to care for their baby this is partly a result of pay differences between men and women partly a result of social norms and expectations mrs hodge who has recently returned from sweden where fathers receive more generous paid leave than in the uk said any extension to existing benefits would need to be affordable but one possibility could be to extend paid maternity leave for a further six months however we should not naturally assume that this role falls on the mother alone parents themselves not government are best placed to decide who should stay at home and care for their own child employers should be working closely with government to develop more opportunities for fathers to take time to care for very young children she said for example measures such as reserving a portion of leave that could only be taken by fathers daddy leave may be one way to encourage fathers to spend more time at home last april the government introduced familyfriendly policies that included giving parents with children under the age of six the right to ask bosses to consider flexible working arrangements an increase in statutory maternity pay to a maximum of a week and an increase in paid maternity leave by eight weeks to weeks which with the prospect of a further six months of unpaid leave could give many mothers a year off for the first time new fathers were given the right to two weeks paid paternity leave at a week the tuc general secretary brendan barber welcomed the idea of increased leave but said for the extended leave to make a real difference to all parents it would have to be paid otherwise only the more affluent mums and dads would be able to reap the benefits it was also welcomed by julie mellor who chairs the equal opportunities commission financial pressures mean that many parents return to work before they are ready she said but susan anderson human resources director at the confederation of british industry said these flexible working rights are only one year old and companies would be extremely concerned to learn that the government is considering extension at this early stage this could jeopardise the good progress that has been made,2004-05,radical proposal extend statutory paid maternity leave six month earmark

jenny mccartney sunday telegraph may members of fathers justice the directaction fathers rights group flourbombed the chamber of the house of commons last week as they bask in the flurry of publicity they probably dont care that it is largely publicity of the wrong sort this is especially sad because so much of what fathers justice says is perfectly sensible there are indeed many fathers who have suffered appalling injustices in the toxic quagmire of divorce and who rightly feel that the legal system is stacked against them although many divorcing couples manage to negotiate joint access to their children fairly many do not it thus falls to the courts to make contact orders but if the resident parent who is usually the mother should fail to uphold it it is rarely enforced any further deborah orr the independent may an obsession with their own plight rather than the pursuit of a more inclusive approach makes fathers justice an unattractive organisation there is wide public sympathy for the plight of fathers who are maliciously denied access to their children but there is also an uncomfortable recognition that if a former couple are so unable to decide between themselves what is best for their children then the courts have little prospect of doing it for them jailing mothers who defy court orders or fining them punishes the child as well as the mother the only hope of men in such a ghastly situation is that they can somehow repair the rift in the parental relationship by deciding to take such a decisive step into the public arena and to orchestrate such a highprofile mediafriendly campaign fathers justice have opted instead for more confrontation their protests are provocative personal immature and egotistical people understand them to be the deeds of desperate people david aaronovitch the observer may the issue is so raw partly because of the coming together of two related trends the first is a sensitivity to the way in which women have been treated historically and the other is the changing view of fatherhood itself with many more men seeing themselves as cocarers than before it is very hard for the law to take account of both and this is where the fathers movement has a big problem there are not going to be jailings and finings of mums even if judges would do it most fathers wont pursue it the longterm answer has to lie in convincing more people to behave better in convincing them that it is shabby and damaging behaviour no matter how bitter they feel to exclude loving fathers from their childrens lives ferdinand mount sunday times may during the past years all our social arrangements not just the divorce laws but the tax and benefit systems too have been tilted away from preserving marriage to securing the rights of the individual in this atmosphere it is only to be expected that so many mothers should feel little obligation to share their children with their feckless and despicable exes it is not a question of rebalancing the scales in favour of men against women it is a question of loading the scales in favour of marriage and the stability that marriage alone with all its tribulations brings to society the deliberate demolition of all the structures supporting marriage has already caused more human misery in this country than any ricin or anthrax attack is likely to inflict on us yet it remains as hard as ever to persuade the politicians to pay much attention daily telegraph leader saturday may the angry fathers have a point but not much of a cause some men are indeed treated badly and many divorced men now expect to play a part in nurturing their children and that requires access on the other hand only in about one in cases do the courts bar fathers from any access many divorced fathers lose interest in children from a previous marriage and vigorously evade paying maintenance most judges keep their attention focused where it belongs on the welfare of the children fathers justice do not deserve a place in history alongside the suffragettes apart from anything else they do not seem very bright it has not occurred to them that their escapades only reinforce the stereotype of the irresponsible male janice turner the times may fathers justices demand that mothers and fathers are granted automatic equal access to children in divorce has never seemed more logical if women insist that we are entitled to half the marital chattels we must concede half our parenting rights we cannot demand that new dad takes his turn at the changing mat and the am feed then tell him should the relationship sour that he is only needed alternate weekends the last great movement of liberation after racial equality gay rights and feminism is surely masculine emancipation it can either take the form of

ministers this week said thousands of parents employing nannies would benefit from tax breaks that would end years of discrimination in favour of those who use childminders and nurseries minister for children margaret hodge said many parents would welcome the reforms which are due to take effect from april next year she expected the move will create jobs for carers but proposals outlining the tax break first announced in the budget drew fire from accountants who said plans for a ceiling on joint salaries of would rule out most parents who used nannies and turn the scheme into a publicity stunt mike warburton of accountant grant thornton said few couples who earned could afford a nanny in the first place and the limited tax credit on offer would fail to make employing a nanny more attractive it is only worth employing a nanny if both parents are working if one parent earns and another they are immediately over the threshold i think parents need a joint income more like to before it becomes viable to employ a nanny a sliding scale from to will also leave higher earning families with a few crumbs the professional association of nursery nurses which represents many of the estimated to nannies working in britain says initially the impact will be small however takeup could grow quickly spokeswoman tricia pritchard says the people i see benefiting are single parents who will not have looked at employing a nanny before they will often need the flexible childcare a nanny offers and earn less than she says there is growing use of parttime nannies which may become more affordable among middle income groups mr warburton argues that whatever happens the scheme will like most of the governments tax credits be tricky to understand and claim so below we clarify the details and look at who will and who will not benefit whats on offer there are no new state benefit or tax credit up for grabs families can get financial support under the existing childcare element of the working tax credit and employersupported childcare schemes the tax credit can only be paid to parents using eligible childcare the government is proposing to expand this range of childcare by setting up a fasttrack voluntary scheme under which childcarers like nannies can be approved for financial support to get approval they must either have a recognised childcare qualification or attend a childcare induction course have their criminal records checked and hold a valid first aid certificate relevant to the care of children which types of childcare will get approval carers who look after children in your home such as nannies and friends individuals providing a childminding service in their own home for children over the age of seven breakfast holiday and activity clubs for children over the age of seven where the main purpose is to provide childcare services run by schools are already eligible for tax credits clubs and activities for children under eight that are of less than two hours duration per day is any type of childcare excluded from this new approval scheme yes residential holiday providers where you pack your children off for a week of fun will not be eligible most important for the many people who rely on grandparents aunts and other relatives is that care provided by an individual in the parents home will not be eligible for tax credits if the carer is related to the child the government says it does not think it appropriate to intervene in private family arrangements however there has always been the option for grandparents and other relatives to register as childminders and look after children in their own the carers home this does of course involve more extensive checks including inspection of the carers home to see that it meets certain standards but a registered childminder whether or not they are related to the children they care for will be eligible for financial support so supposing my nanny gets approval under the new scheme remind me how i qualify for the childcare tax credit this is a benefit an element within the working tax credit available to families with one child earning up to a year or those with two chil dren or more earning up to a year likely to be uprated next year when the rule takes effect who pay for some form of eligible childcare single parents or both parents in a couple must be working at least hours a week to qualify and how much is the tax credit worth it pays up to per cent of your childcare costs the percentage you get depends on your income subject to maximum limits on the weekly costs you can claim for if you pay for care for one child the weekly limit on costs is so the maximum you can receive at is a week if you pay for care for two or more children the weekly limit is and therefore the maximum claim is the national childcare charity daycare trust is campaigning for more help with childcare costs through the tax credit for working families particularly those on lower incomes who it points out still have to find at least a hefty per cent of the cost of childcare how does the new approval scheme affect employersupported childcare at present employees can use employerprovided childcare vouchers to fund childcare from any provider whether registered or not and the full cost of the voucher is exempt from national insurance contributions nics so an employee using childcare vouchers to pay for unregistered care can save up to per cent nics from april as announced in the budget employees will be able to get the first a week of employerprovided childcare vouchers free of income tax as well as nics but the exemption will only apply from april if they use registered childcare or childcare approved under the new scheme what if i use registered or approved childcare while qualifying for the tax credit and my employer also offers me childcare vouchers can i benefit from both types of support towards my childcare costs the inland revenue says whatever amount is covered by the employer does not count towards a claim for the childcare element it means the childcare element covers up to per cent of the costs left over after employer contributions a spokeswoman said for example if the costs are before any kind of support and the employer was providing of vouchers to go towards the costs the family would get the childcare element of up to of the remaining they would also get the tax and nics exemption on the voucher from the employer the daycare trust says the tradeoff between the voucher from an employer and the childcare element should force parents to look at how much they might get through the tax credit before they consider whether to take up childcare vouchers you can get advice on tax credits and claim forms from any tax office at

their slogan is the title of a manic street preachers song if you tolerate this then your children will be next their membership is flourishing and their tactics are increasingly militant in the months since fathers justice was formed by matt oconnor a marketing consultant the issue of a fathers right to see his child has been highlighted as never before but the campaign group has become increasingly confrontationalsolicitors have been bombarded with abusive emails court offices stormed and judges visited at their homes leading to accusations from lawyers and exwives that the organisation has created an atmosphere of intimidation and fear while prominent members of the group defend these tactics the truth behind many of the cases they publicise is more complex than their slogans suggest former wives and girlfriends who spoke to the guardian described relationship break ups involving domestic violence being forced to live in refuges and incidents in which their children witnessed frightening aggression by their fathers mr oconnors exwife sophie a primary school teacher who is now on good terms with her former husband said there is always a story behind every case every case is individual women have their own reasons for what they do sometimes they have good reasons in ms oconnors opinion the role of the law is to protect the woman and children when a relationship breaks down fathers justice suggest women should go to prison if they dont keep to the contact orders that is just not going to happen like it or not women are the primary carers i know that is not the popular view but it is generally true the case of conrad campbell is an example of the allegations and counter allegations bitterness and anger which engulf relationship breakdowns and defy easy solutions mr campbell joined fathers justice out of desperation after losing contact with his child i went to prison for days last summer just for texting my son because it was his birthday that week he said she the childs mother said i was in breach of an injunction because i was trying to keep up contact with my son that it was harassment and she was in fear of her life and i was sent to jail he does however admit assaulting his partner and being sent on a programme to tackle his anger his expartner who did not wish to be named says she was the victim of a domestic assault by her childs father but despite this he was allowed contact with the boy after their break up he gave up his parental responsibility she said this is what i cannot understand he had access he used to see him in a care centre then one time we arranged to meet and he tried to drag my son out of the car and smashed the door now he has got no access at all he is not allowed it flour bomb of all the demonstrations fathers justice has carried out from cranetop protests to the storming of court rooms none has created more publicity than last wednesdays flour bombing of the prime minister in the house of commons the men involved in these protests say on their website they try to adopt tactics which will make their children go wow thats my dad in reality the highprofile protests embarrass children and often frighten their mothers i wasnt surprised when i saw the house of commons thing said ms oconnor matthew is a very active campaigner and his aim is to get publicity but i think all children tend to be embarrassed by their parents and mine are at the age that they cringe when he gets on the television another exwife described the tactics as very childish they dont take anyone elses thoughts into consideration so how can they expect us to believe they are doing this because they are thinking of their children they act like boys who get angry and frustrated when they cant get what they want while the group is committed to nonviolence its website contains an implicit threat that if reform is not precipitated the organisation cannot guarantee that offshoots will not become more militant for lawyers in the family courts the tactics of fathers justice are already too extreme there are sad cases of fathers who have been prevented from seeing their children sometimes because they are being awkward sometimes because of their partners being awkward said one family lawyer but these men do not help themselves by joining this sort of paranoid organisation which adopts aggressive intimidating tactics people who deal with women who have suffered violence at the hands of their partners believe the activities of fathers justice obscure the truth about fathers rights the whole thing is a bit of a myth said sandra horley the chief executive of refuge figures last year showed the courts dealt with around cases and men were refused contact in cases thats about so i think they have exaggerated this out of all proportion mr oconnor says the failure of the courts to uphold a mans right to see his child has caused membership to boom to in the past year and he

at last there is to be a tax break for nannyemploying working parents this week the government announced that from april families using nannies to care for their kids would be able to join those using nurseries and childminders in getting some cash back from the treasury to help them meet their costs but hold the rejoicing because theres more to this than meets the eye to start with its only families on a joint annual income of less than if they have one child or if they have two or more who qualify those arent tiny incomes but if you can afford a nanny at least in london or another big city it tends to mean you are a family with a higher joint income than that whats more to be eligible for the tax credit you need to register your nanny and have her policechecked on a register that incidentally doesnt yet exist whitehall is working on it for some families there is also the fact that they hire their nanny illegally without paying her tax or national insurance contributions registering her for the tax creditobviously also brings to the treasurys attention that she is an earner and therefore should be a taxpayer since paying her tax bill is your job as her employer the result to you is probably more burden than gain you benefit to the tune of the tax relief a week for one child or for two or more but you lose in terms of the tax and national insurance you are now required to pay on her behalf inevitably no one really knows what proportion of britains nannies are employed through informal cashinhand arrangements although anecdotally it would certainly seem to be huge it also raises the question of who exactly are todays nannies who are the women and very occasionally men in whose charge we leave our precious little bundles while we hurry off to the office the big divide in nannying is between the qualified and the unqualified but it doesnt follow that the unqualified are the less soughtafter parents on the whole tend to be more concerned with qualifications than they were in the past says annie prior who has run annies nannies in london for years but this is a business where you have to go with your instinct about who seems the right carer for your child speaking personally i had an unqualified nanny for years and she was wonderful having a rapport with children is crucial however qualified a nanny is if she doesnt seem to hit it off with the kids shes not going to get the job one of the big changes in the nannying landscape over the past couple of years says prior is the decline of superwoman the highearning flatout attheofficetillallhours mum has reassessed her life asked what its all for and is now favouring a more laidback two or three days a week working schedule for which she no longer needs fulltime nanny cover enter the niche nanny the new trend is for the nanny who is available exactly when you need her for just the hours you need her and who is paid accordingly foremost among the niche nannies are the new afterschool nannies who bridge the gap between the pm school bell and the pm office clockingoff time once your kids hit school age youre looking for a different kind of nanny and youre looking for different hours of cover says caroline cooke who set up the after school nannies agency two years ago parents dont want to be paying a nanny to sit around at home all day while their children are out when what they really need is someone to collect them from school make their tea and oversee their homework between pm and pm when i tried to find that kind of care i found it wasnt available so i set up the agency most of the nannies who work for me are nursery school teachers whove got time at the end of their working day to care for other peoples children for a few hours and are eminently wellqualified to do so night nannies is another niche agency for a night in london cheaper elsewhere they will provide you with a nanny to soothe feed quieten and even sleeptrain your baby so that you get an undisturbed kip people tend to use us in the early months for two or three nights a week it helps them get through that tiredness of being woken night after night says anastasia baker who set up night nannies four years ago the other sort of business we get is from parents with older babies who have got into bad habits and need some sleep training three nights usually does the trick ive got around nannies working across london most nights talk to nannies and what you pick up is that the muchhyped perks the car the flat the holiday in the caribbean the healthclub membership are not what count ultimately what every nanny wants is to find a family they gel with and feel part of and who respect their work says caroline burke who has nannied for years in my experience most nannies prefer to live out whatever the cost and however exciting the inhouse perks because if theyre inhouse its hard not to get involved when youre off duty and you want your own life most of us dont like nanny shares because theyre complicated and you tend to find one family resenting the time youre spending with the other one the main bugbears tend to be the employers who are supposed to be home at pm but who roll home at pm and dont seem to realise why youre put out and the ones who talk down to you and dont treat you with respect but says burke the biggest problem for nannies is the lack of a career path you do your training youre good at your job but theres no promotion no career ladder you can go from one family to another but ultimately its the same job ive enjoyed it but ive recently decided to move on and im in the process of setting up a coffee shop for the eastern european au pairs the difficulties are more deeply felt some of us work hard for very little money in uk terms says yearold marika who trained as a teacher in her native slovakia ive been paid a week as an au pair now though ive moved out and i do two different nannying jobs that together bring in a week its a fortune when you bear in mind that id be paid around a month if i went home and got a job as a teacher marika is happy with her lot but not all her friends are as lucky before you arrive youre told youll be doing five hours work a day five days a week but when you get here you realise they want you to do a lot more than that says anna and some people just arent welcomed into the family as au pairs should be i know one girl who has never in a year of living with them been invited to eat with the family you feel like you arent really cared for and youre a long way from your home and your own family meanwhile at playgroups baby gyms and one oclock clubs across the land there is a clear hierarchy in place as parents and nannies gather to watch the youngsters in their care mothers can spot nannies a mile off and nannies can spot mothers a mile off says burke sometimes mothers will talk to you and be pleasant but often theres a barrier you feel youre a bit of a nonperson with a mum someone she isnt going to waste her time talking to meanwhile english nannies tend to look down on the eastern european au pairs and badmouth their efforts to look after their charges you cant believe that sensible people would leave their babies with girls who hardly speak a word of english and wouldnt know how to dial in an emergency says one the au pairs for their part feel excluded the mothers talk to the mothers the english nannies talk to the english nannies and the slovakians talk to the slovakians says marika id hate to find i was the only au pair at a playgroup because no one would talk to me theyd say its because my english isnt good but perhaps my english would be better if they did speak to me a brief guide to the nanny state the norland nanny graduates of norland training colleges are the cream of british nannies most follow a twoyear course and though entry can be after gcse an increasing number are postalevel college fees are high a term and while bursaries are available many students are selffinancing which adds to the suspicion that some couples insist on a norlander so that shell be a gal with a bit of breeding snobbery apart the norland course is very thorough and there are always more vacancies than the inhouse jobs agency has norlanders to fill their nannies command salaries of up to net a week for jobs overseas net a week for livein jobs in london and a week for liveout jobs in the capital the australian new zealander or south african mothers help if youre not in the norland bracket an au pair or mothers help from the above countries could be your preference much more affordable expect to pay in the region of for a liveout in the southeast perhaps or if shes living in some newworld nannies have qualifications most have experience of looking after other peoples kids but what theyre renowned for is their ability to muck in and be jolly on the down side theyre often too ready to move on the treasure in her s or s the treasure has raised her own kids and if she has grandchildren is likely to be involved in looking after them as well what she lacks in professional qualifications she more than makes up for in experience with a treasure it is less what you tell her and more how you watch her to pick up tips more affordable than norlanders around a week net treasures also tend to move around less often than younger nannies on the down side theyre always ripe for poachers so you have to keep them sweet the homegrown nneb collegetrained nnebs arent as sought after as is sometimes believed after a spate of news stories about

labour will seek to consolidate its family friendly credentials and woo women voters today by giving middleincome families tax breaks for hiring nannies the scheme will see thousands of families that earn less than benefiting at a cost to the treasury of m a year ministers hope the payment of a week for one cuhild or for two will allow more women to be able to go out to work with a nanny costing up to a year in the capital and elsewhere many mothers in jobs not compatible with nursery hours cannot afford to return to the workplace until now only families using childminders and nurseries had been eligible for help with childcare through the child tax credit which puts money back into pay packets for approved facilities but critics of this system including the blairite outrider and former cabinet minister stephen byers have argued that it penalises parents whose jobs demand greater flexibility under the new scheme which is expected to be introduced next april families with nannies will benefit as will those that employ childminders to look after children in their own homes parents who place their children in breakfast or holiday clubs for the oversevens where childcare is the main purpose will also get the perk as will those putting children under eight in clubs that last less than two hours but in a move that will anger parents who rely on extended families the tax break will not extend to grandparents another suggestion of mr byers ministers believe it would be inappropriate to bring money into family arrangements yesterday the childrens minister margaret hodge stressed the extent to which childcare had become an electoral issue when she sought to highlight the governments record on childcare the current tax credit system helps families and is worth up to of the weekly childcare bill but labour women mps including ms hodge and the cabinet ministers patricia hewitt and harriet harman have warned that women are becoming less likely to vote at all and that more needs to be done to win them over the conservatives and liberal democrats are also seeking to woo women voters with pledges on childcare the tories are looking at paying mothers to care for children at home though the scheme would only be worth around a month and the libdems have pledged an extra m on childcare a year yesterday ms hodge said labour is convinced that childcare is now top of the agenda for this election campaign it will be a major issue for parents and families come polling day over six million families and million children are benefiting from labours new tax credits but we need to do more so our new plans and the priority we will give this issue in our manifesto will show mums and dads that labour is on their side understands the pressures they face nowadays and is coming up with new ways to help them balance work and family life and we will be taking every opportunity we can to ram home the message that the tories are committed to cutting childcare as part of their plans to cut an immediate bn from public spending the plan would see nannies and afterschool club workers having to register and undergo training such as first aid courses and criminal checks before the benefit could be received for them anne longfield director of the charity children said the measures would close dangerous loopholes and welcomed the flexibility they provided people want their children to be looked after in their own home which is particularly important to those who work nonoffice hours or shifts and for parents of disabled children she said until now no national

they gave their names to our nanny culture helped to raise hundreds of thousands of youngsters and were celebrated by julie andrews in mary poppins now nannies are to become the subject of tax breaks ministers will reveal tomorrow that parents who hire people to look after their children will be eligible for tax relief in this way mothers will be encouraged to go back to work at present many families are being priced out of childcare by crippling costs a fulltime nanny in london can earn up to a year more than a womans average salary the perk is not restricted to fulltime nannies it will also be extended to those who use afterschool and holiday clubs or who employ trained childminders in the childs own home but relatives who look after children in their own homes will be excluded ministers say it would be inappropriate to bring money into family arrangements this will disappoint parents who are reluctant to leave their children with strangers anne longfield director of the group children said the nanny tax relief would benefit thousands of families its a kind of childcare which we know masses of people have been using but they dont get any help for it she said the tax break which is likely to be introduced next april is expected to be of most use to families with parttime nannies or nanny shares where the same carer is swapped between several parents than to households which pay for fulltime nannies because it is available only to families earning up to a year those who can afford to hire a fulltime livein nanny particularly in london and southeast england are more likely to have higher salaries nannies and afterschool club workers will have to register and undergo training such as first aid courses and be subject to criminal records checks before parents can get the cash tackling fears that unqualified carers could pose a risk to young children until now only families using childminders and nurseries were eligible for the child tax credit which gives cash back through paypackets for approved childcare options such as nannies childminders who work in the childs own home and afterschool or holiday clubs for the oversevens have been out of many parents reach because they do not attract the tax break childcare costs are rising far faster than inflation with the average nursery now charging more than a year for each child in london some cost more than a minor private school with the most expensive found by the daycare trust charity to be costing a year margaret hodge the childrens minister who will publish the consultation plans said that the move would give working families more choice about who cares for their children we want all parents to have access to affordable and goodquality childcare expanding the range of children eligible should help thousands of families the move will increase pressure on the tories who are drawing up their own plans to help working mothers juggle work and families

welcome to the wrap guardian unlimiteds roundup of the best of the days papers also in todays wrap blair urged to distance himself from white house mirror photos row continues and trouble and strife at portsmouth fc papers hail gandhi election triumph the rise of sonia gandhi and fall of indias ruling bhatratiya janata party bjp are celebrated by most of the papers this morning the italianborn leader of the congress party who is the widow of former premier rajiv gandhi is on the brink of taking power in the worlds largest democracy having pulled off a surprise victory over the hindu nationalist bjp the result heralds an extraordinary political rebirth for a leader and a party that have been written off on numerous occasions even in recent weeks says the financial times most commentators though it impossible that a foreignborn woman leader who was previously a housewife could become prime minister the commentators werent alone the bjp did not expect to lose campaigning under the slogan india shining the party was certain that the countrys strong economy and the prospect of peace with pakistan would carry it back into office the broadsheets make much of mrs gandhis amazing life story perhaps the best is randeep rameshs risotto to raj saga in the guardian for sonia it is in the small town of orbassano seven miles from italys busy metropolis of turin that her extraordinary journey begins he writes arriving in india in the young mrs gandhi struggled to cope with the countrys deeply ingrained culture at first she did not like indian food or clothes and there was a minor uproar when she was pictured in a miniskirt sucking on a lolly its top stuff ramesh also writes fascinatingly about the reasons for mrs gandhis triumph which he attributes to the magnetic power of her family name and her strategy of targeting rural india which remains chained to poverty and left behind as the urban centres modernise her message that india did not shine outside of its conurbations was successful because it was true he says bronwen maddox in the times disagrees for her the results cannot simply be explained by a rural bitterness at the evolution of two indias instead she believes that the rural backlash appears to have been part of a wider antiincumbent sentiment which indian voters have repeatedly turned on their leaders she does however agree with the guardians leader which cheers a vote against nationalism and sectarianism that the return to life of the congress party is reassuring because it bolsters the secular foundations of indias democracy which had seemed under threat during the bjps rule gandhi dynasty rises again the dynasty continues ft indian electorate throws out vajpayee pm urged to distance himself from bush the guardian splashes with the news that senior figures across the labour party are urging tony blair to publicly detach himself from the bush administration amid fears that that the crisis in iraq is undermining his domestic standing and contributing to a potential catastrophe for labour at the june elections the prime minister is apparently said to concede that he will have to soften his stance on iraq in the wake of the abu ghraib prison torture scandal and thats not all mr blair has also indicated that he will do more to court the democrats who are seeking to put john kerry in the white house however the pms new campaign of conciliation gets off to a funny start in the independent interviewed by the papers political editor andy grice mr blair declares i will remain shoulder to shoulder with george bush he then dismisses the idea that at the time of maximum difficulties you start messing around your main ally that this stance would appear to be a mistake is illustrated by both kevin maguire in the guardian and greg hurst in the times visiting electoral battlegrounds birmingham and rochdale both find traditional labour voters set to switch their support in june the guardian quotes a labour councillor richard bashford as saying if the iraq war hadnt happened the inner cities would have stayed with us by and large instead they are switching to the lib dems who opposed the war perhaps the

to our troops now so does he in short no mr morgan never one to go on the defensive instead uses his page two to accuse mr ingram of wriggling out of apologising for denying to mps that he had received adverse reports about prisoner abuse from human rights groups the mirror describes mr ingrams claim that what amnesty international had sent him was a letter not a report as a bizarre defence

when the electoral commission discovered last month that women dont involve themselves in party politics preferring to vote sign petitions and talk behind the scenes worried female columnists in westminster came up with a variety of explanations women dont like joining groups they dont like swallowing a party manifesto whole they think there are too many men in the game and too few women these are plausible enough explanations but the one that caught my eye turned up a few paragraphs down the reports noted slightly shamefacedly women have relatively little confidence in their ability to influence the political process never mind the guff about women preferring to vote for women this is the key finding unfortunately theres no easy fix for a lack of selfbelief even more depressingly womens reticence is evident in the bright new playground which the fringes of westminster are beginning to notice that of political blogs women do blog according to a blogcensus survey last august just under of englishlanguage weblogs were owned by men and by women the rest belonged to groups or were of unknown origin but blogcensus also found that nearly half the weblogs surveyed were personal diaries and in that category women outnumbered men by about two to one fewer than one in of the political blogs was written by a woman disproportionate numbers of men are blogging about politics and technology says jane perrone the editor of the guardians weblog the uneven gender split is matched in the offline world that tallies with the latest sitemeter blog popularity rankings in the us of the top only one the satirical washington blog wonkette is written by a woman maledominated networks and inflexible working hours have traditionally hindered the progress of female politicians neither affects womens ability to join in the political blogging community yet very few do in january guardian unlimited politics invited readers to nominate their favourite political blogs and vote for a shortlist of all the blogs proposed only two were written by women lynne featherstones gla and haringey diary and the illinoisbased karmalised i personally hate making statements about women versus men says wonkette ana marie cox when i ask her why females are so underrepresented in the field gender essentialism is bad i will make some grand assumptions and hope that you understand female political bloggers that get linked to tend to write in a more frankly personal way sometimes even a flirtatious way i dont know if all women bloggers do many of the prominent female bloggers in the us she adds are rightwing what we call war bloggers women who first started to write after september a number make a point of supporting us soldiers abroad and consider their blogging a fundamentally patriotic moraleboosting exercise that particular impulse characteristic of us politics was briefly mirrored by democrats who built blogs to support the shortlived candidacy of howard dean cox herself admits she has been criticised by other female bloggers for talking like a sailor on wonkette whose running jokes about the size of john kerrys manhood and george bushs camper bodily postures sit alongside searing attacks on each mans political conduct yet she says if you look carefully i dont actually write about sex people think that im writing about myself but if anyone tried to find out about me theyd have a difficult job clues to the wonkette persona lie in the sketch at the top of the blog it shows a feisty young woman in boots and spectacles stretched out on a desk next to a cat theres a little stars and stripes tucked into her pencil mug think maggie gyllenhaal in secretary crossed with martha gellhorn and then add a pinch of irony cox points out that many of the more popular political bloggers are established journalists i mean ive been a journalist for ten years and its worth noting that most journalists are very good at hiding behind their copy revealing just enough to intrigue the reader making their point and dashing offstage without taking questions true some british female columnists have become a great deal more forthcoming about their private lives over the past decade many however have not take melanie phillips the daily mail columnist and blogger phillips does forceful detached outrage as well as any man and her private life is most definitely offlimits while you dont have to be madame de pompadour to win over the rest of the blogging community an element of titillation certainly appears to help and if as the electoral commission says women remain firmly outside the political establishment then provocation may be the best device for getting westminster and washingtons attention the good news is that women are starting to use weblogs as leverage to increase their influence says perrone i think things will change agrees cox and many male mps might well agree who wants to be sitting meekly in the commons chamber when you can be the

plumbing remain male bastions despite making desperate calls for female recruits to boost the number of entrants the eoc says its yearlong investigation concludes that recruiting more women in nontraditional occupations is the key to ending severe shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the labour market but many industries have failed to make any headway the report plugging britains skills gap challenging gender segregation in training and work identifies key barriers to women entering nontraditional occupations julie mellor chair of the eoc says skills shortages also have a significant impact on employers even highprofile projects such as heathrows terminal are having problems finding enough skilled workers in the short term the governments relaunch of the modern apprenticeship programme will provide an exciting opportunity to open up more choices for young people and supply business with a more diverse pool of workers the labour force statistics show that three quarters of working women are still found in just five occupational groups associate professional and technical such as nursing admin and secretarial work personal services such as caring for children or older people sales and customer service and nonskilled manual work the eoc figures indicate that in engineering women form of those taking modern apprenticeships and represent just of the engineering workforce in construction of people taking apprenticeships are women and women made up only of those working in construction jobs the eoc is calling on the government to respond to the report by developing a national strategy to tackle gender segregation in training and work this should incorporate targets to make change happen and provide incentives and information for young people and employers in skill shortage areas to make it easier for them to make nontraditional choices sir michael latham chairman of constructionskills says we welcome the equal opportunities commissions investigation into the gender gaps in industry only by tackling the shortage of women and ethnic minorities in the construction industry will we be able to address the industrys skills shortages the tendency for women to predomi nate in some occupations and men in others correlates with the subject choices made by boys and girls while still at school research shows that choices made at age are influenced by gender and are exactly mirrored in later choices of modern apprenticeships as background to the eoc investigation adults were questioned last month about their attitudes towards stereotypes of womens and mens working roles the survey showed that around half of women and men thought the advice they received on leaving school and deciding what kind of job they wanted to do was

recruiting more women into stereotypically male occupations such as construction is the answer to the uks severe shortage of skilled plumbers builders and engineers according to a new report an investigation by the equal opportunities commission published yesterday finds a clear link between shortage sectors well known to householders casting around for help when roofs leak or pipes burst and the under representation of women the eocs inquiry the first phase of a major investigation into gender segregation in work and training reveals that women are underrepresented in key areas including construction where they make up just of the workforce while the gender gap has closed to virtual parity in highstatus professional sectors such as law accountancy and medicine the numbers of women going into building plumbing engineering and information technology has barely altered in the last years the study shows meanwhile men are barely represented in childcare another fast expanding sector with a shortage of recruits far from improving the situation may be worsening since gender segregation on the governments modern apprenticeship scheme for young people is even more severe than in the workforce as a whole the eoc chairwoman julie mellor said yesterday that the research had identified real barriers to women joining certain occupations the situation not only perpetuated stereotypes but blighted individual businesses and hit the uks productivity occupational segregation also helps maintain britains pay gap where women in fulltime work are paid on average less an hour than men the report concludes recruiting more women is a clear solution to severe shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the labour market it also found that while a range of initiatives by employers and the government exists to increase the number of men or women in different jobs they are ineffective because there is no overall strategy and no local or national government targets lying behind the lack of women in traditionally male occupations is a range of factors from inadequate careers advice to prejudice or caution on the part of employers and the macho culture of some maledominated workplaces according to the study girls making careers choices are also unlikely to understand the pay advantages of conventionally male jobs the gap is glaring even at apprentice level according to figures in one region in modern apprentices in heating ventilation all male were paid an hour while those training in childcare all female earned an hour the government needs to go further than its current plans for restructuring modern apprenticeships to be unveiled by the chancellor gordon brown on monday the report says it also adds that companies should be offered a subsidy

one of the biggest ironies of middleclass parenting is that nannies employed by professional people to look after their most precious assets often dont even have a written employment contract but although this lapse may be the result of embarrassment or intended as a proof of trust its a mistake as the dolores oriordan case proved last week the lead singer of the cranberries was taken to court by her former nanny joy fahy who was pursuing benefits including a cherokee fourwheel drive vehicle and a deposit on a flat which she claimed were promised to her if her verbal contract was terminated among her more serious allegations were that she had been falsely imprisoned by the star and her husband when working for them in fact fahy won only one count against oriordan who was ordered to pay compensation to replace worth of clothes that the nanny lost as a result of the dispute all the other allegations were dismissed by the judge who called the couple exemplary parents none the less the case is a stark reminder that nannies have the right to seek redress in the courts and that without a written employment contract its far more difficult for parents to prove their side of the story a growing number of nannies are taking legal action against parents because there is so much more awareness about employment rights says maggie dyer director of the london au pair and nanny agency the problem is that many parents dont realise this until its too late traditionally they have seen nannies not as professional people but as domestics dyers agency is among those working hard to persuade parents to get an agreement signed by both parent and nanny clearly outlining what can be expected from each party issues covered she says should include everything from working hours to holiday entitlement and from confidentiality issues to disciplinary action but all too often it never happens she admits susan clark not her real name mother of three children under who lives in wandsworth south london found out the hard way we never got round to drawing up a contract largely because we felt we treated our nanny well and we thought she liked us but she was young and got herself an unpleasant boyfriend she started going out when shed previously been happy to work often came in at night drunk and started putting the children in what we felt to be dangerous situations eventually we had to get rid of her the next thing we knew we were contacted by a solicitor who said she was taking legal action against us for treating her unfairly she dropped the case but it was a horrid time and its put me off ever employing another nanny in an attempt to avoid such situations little darlings a nanny agency serving the south of england insists that any clients on its books draw up a formal contract when hiring a nanny a copy of which must be sent to the agency within eight weeks this measure comes under the latest regulations affecting employment agencies explains melissa bieklecki proprietor of little darlings strictly speaking nanny agencies are introduction agencies rather than employment agencies because its the parents who actually do the employing so we are not legally obliged to follow the regulations but we have volunteered nevertheless job descriptions are as important as any employment contract she adds if a nanny applies for a job with a very clear job description there is much less chance of relationships turning sour louise shephard coauthor of the nanny handbook a guide to hiring and handling nannies believes communication is the key job descriptions and contracts are important but its communication that will make or break any working relationship with a nanny unfortunately because misbehaviour from either the nanny or employer isnt witnessed by anyone as it would be in say an office it can be more difficult to deal with perhaps a sign of the times says dyer is that a growing number of nannies are applying for paid maternity leave nannies are demanding to be treated like any other employee and with the responsibility they carry a formal agreement is becoming a necessity for both sides,2004-05,one biggest irony middleclass

firms should be offered a special subsidy to help attract more women into construction engineering and plumbing in order to address the current shortage of skilled workers a report recommended today the report published by the equal opportunities commission said that the recruitment of more women into traditionally maledominated professions would help tackle the severe shortage in some sectors of the labour market the eoc urged the government to develop a new strategy to boost the number of women in skilled jobs suggesting that an extra subsidy given to companies who take on women could be one way to break down the barriers and help close the pay gap between men and women research revealed that despite initiatives to counter their gender bias there had been no significant increase in the number of women working in construction engineering or plumbing over the last years the commissions chairwoman julie mellor said that research had identified real barriers preventing women from joining these professions according to the latest figures women make up just of construction workers and of engineers the report also found that modern apprenticeships and careers advice often reinforced rather than eradicated sex segregation with women still being channelled into jobs such as childcare instead of being encouraged into a wider range of employment one young woman who contacted the eoc described the barriers she had faced when trying to become a plumber including difficulty getting on to a course or even getting past a female secretary when telephoning companies to ask about a career the eoc also pointed out what they saw as a clear link between skills shortages and the underrepresentation of women unless we see dramatic action to address this major skills shortages will continue to blight individual businesses and damage the wider economy she said caroline slocock chief executive of the eoc told a news conference at westminster that widening the recruitment pool would benefit the uk economy the eoc is to launch an advertising campaign encouraging employers to take on more women using the example of motheroftwo pauline brown from london who is training to become a plumber even though her friends and family thought she should pursue a different career frances ogrady the tuc deputy general secretary agreed with the findings and recommendations of the report so long as the better paid jobs in plumbing and it are seen as jobs for the boys and the lowpaid caring jobs just for the girls the pay gap is never going to go away she said liberal democrat spokesperson for women sandra gidley also welcomed the report although she went on to question its conclusions this report highlights the gender aspects of skills shortages but the eoc fails to provide the right solution she said by the time young women come to choose a career they may already have made choices that will prevent them from pursuing jobs in areas traditionally thought of as only suitable for men young people need to be made aware of the range of jobs available to them at a much earlier age particularly when choosing subject options young women should know

victim support groups today welcomed government measures to persuade more rape victims to take their attackers to court harriet harman the solicitor general published proposals to create more specialist rape prosecutors in a bid to boost convictions which have dropped from one in three to one in within a generation in a speech to rape prosecutors in london ms harman also pledged to fight any moves to give anonymity to people accused of sex crimes following last years sex offences act which came into force last month and redefined consent to put the burden of proof back on the offender the crown prosecution service cps today published a policy pamphlet aimed at reassuring sex crime victims that trials will be less traumatic experiences it suggests more specialised rape prosecutors who would stay with a trial to its conclusion and a safety net referral back to other specialist rape prosecutors before charges are dropped or downgraded ms harman also announced an expansion of the current rape crisis centres from to saying our focus on rape is not political correctness its a criminal justice imperative victim support which campaigns for and counsels the victims of crime said we support these measures especially the specialist prosecutors who can challenge defence lawyers particularly over victims sexual histories which should not come up but often does the extra crisis centres will also help a lot however they added theres not much new here but it strengthens what already exists in her speech ms harman took a swipe at the media for giving too much prominence to cases of women making false rape allegations she said those who believe the myths about rape dont see what all of you here do and as i do in my work as solicitor general the awful cases of rape often accompanied by sickening levels of violence and which traumatises the victim and often the friends and family speaking after the conference ms harman rejected growing calls for alleged perpetrators of rape to be given anonymity until or unless found guilty she said such a move would have to mean granting anonymity to all suspected criminals as withholding the names of those suspected of sex offences but not other crimes would make it appear that sex attack victims were more likely to lie ms harman said the home secretary has said hes looking at whether there should be greater anonymity it will either be for everybody or nobody i think that if theres going to be anonymity for defendants it needs to be for all defendants and not just rape defendants you cant have a situation where the system says that if its a rape complaint its more likely to be false there is no evidence to support that last july the commons home affairs select committee recommended that anonymity should be reintroduced but the home office said at the time that it was not minded to implement such a change on the grounds that people accused of sexual offences should not be singled out for special protection the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc and ms harman unveiled the policy statement at a london conference this morning ms harman warned the conference of cps rape prosecutors that a prosecution is always going to be an ordeal for a rape victim but that the statement was designed to explain to members of the public and particularly victims and witnesses of rape offences how rape prosecutions are carried out mr macdonald said rape is still less likely to be reported less likely to result in a charge and less likely to be prosecuted than other serious crimes thats why this policy is so important in showing how seriously the cps takes rape allegations it will encourage victims to come forward and get the support they need according to the british crime survey about one in women said they had been raped since the age of an estimated victims about one in women said they had experienced some form of sexual victimisation figures from the rape crisis network found that of rape victims never reported their ordeal but the more radical campaigning group women against rape dismissed the todays launch as little more than a public relations exercise spokeswoman ruth hall said were worried that with specialist barristers more is less all cps prosecutors should be schooled in rape and able to prosecute not just handing cases over to specialists the cps is fundamentally sexist and a bias against women still exists the cps looks for problems not solutions frankly weve heard it all before,2004-06,victim support group today welcomed government measure persuade rape

im very pleased to be able to be here today on the occasion of the launch of the new cps policy on prosecuting rape and your national conference of rape prosecutors id like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance the government attaches to effectively tackling the crime of rape remind you of some of the provisions of the new sexual offences act mention some of the initiatives which are getting underway or are in the pipeline to ensure effective support for victims and bringing rapists to justice tackling rape is important for you as specialist rape prosecutors and its an important issue for me for three reasons because i want women to be able to have confidence in the justice system and rape is an offence which causes great fear and suffering to women because im member of parliament for a london constituency and reported rapes are in london and because as solicitor general i am one of the governments two law officers and we are your government ministers the house of commons has a keen interest in the effective prosecution of rape and you in the cps are taking steps to tackle the particular challenges of bringing these difficult cases to court and the commitment to tackling rape is shared by the dpp ken macdonald qc and across government the importance of effectively tackling the crime of rape we want the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system we want the criminal justice system to bring offenders to justice but of all serious violent crime rape is less likely to be reported less likely to be prosecuted and less likely to result in a conviction to command confidence the cjs must command confidence of the rape victim as well as the victim of the burglary or the mugging to narrow the justice gap we must tackle the gap between the number of rapes and the number of convictions i want to mention briefly the numbers the rape crisis federation estimate that of women tell noone that they have been raped but the number of reported rapes has been increasing if that means an increase in rapes then that is very worrying but i believe that to a large extent what this increase in reporting reflects is an increase in confidence in the criminal justice system victims who in the past would have struggled to cope with the aftermath of a rape on their own are now more likely to report it and to seek support and justice to that extent the increase in the figures of reported rapes is to be welcomed but its also the fact that though the number of rape convictions have been increasing the of convictions as a of those proceeded against has fallen to the extend that means that juries are more sceptical or that investigations are getting it wrong then that is worrying but i believe that it is because prosecutors are more prepared than they might have been in the past to press on with a case particularly where the victim and defendant were known to each other obviously there should be as few as possible cases taken to court with the ordeal that entails for both victim and defendant where there is no conviction but it will always be the case that it is hard to predict with certainty how the jury will react in a case where there is little or no independent evidence and it is her word against his it must be right for prosecutors not to do too much by way of secondguessing of the jury but to leave it to them to decide making that happen to tackle the lack of public confidence and reduce the serious gap between offending and conviction we have done a number of things challenge the myths that beset rape and sexual offences strengthen the legal framework have the right procedures particularly support for the victim ensure we have an effective partnership at local level backed up by an effective partnership at national level and the right sentencing first challenging the myths it is not long since many held the view that if a woman had been raped she probably brought it on herself dancing or dressing provocatively or that even though she said no she meant yes or she consented but later thought better of it and so cried rape or she was his wife or girlfriend so whats the fuss about or that she was drunk and so was fair game or that she consented to have sex with him so she can hardly cry rape when his friends join in the rare cases of women whove made false allegations get widely reported and for many confirm the sense that rape complaints are to be treated with suspicion rather than rigour it was only as recently as in the nineteen nineties that rape within marriage was treated as a crime it was the cps that challenged the conventional wisdom that a man was entitled to sex with his wife that consent was implied through marriage and therefore forced sex could not be rape those who believe the myths about rape dont see what all of you here do and as i do in my work as solicitor general the awful cases of rape often accompanied by sickening levels of violence and which traumatises the victim and often the friends and family as well they dont understand that however much support you give however sensitive all the agencies a prosecution is always going to be an ordeal for a rape victim but progress is being made and now the criminal justice system recognises that whatever the circumstances whether or not the victim and perpetrator are known to each other rape is a crime which will be treated with the utmost seriousness our focus on rape is not political correctness its a criminal justice imperative and we will not be deflected convicting the perpetrator is not just about ensuring justice for the victim its also a preventive measure sex offenders usually go on committing crimes until they are stopped so a prosecution is not just about this victim but also about protecting what might otherwise be his next victim the right laws in place as well as challenging the myths we have to have the right legal framework to tackle rape id like to remind you of the key provisions of the sexual offences act which drew support from all political parties the criminal justice system and the voluntary sector and which came into effect on may st this year it changes the law so that the prosecution will not have to prove lack of consent where the victim is a child under years this will spare the child having to answer and the police having to ask a case i had recently was a stark reminder of this the statement of an year old girl included her denial that she had led on her stepfather who had had sex with her there will be a presumption rebuttable of course that the victim did not consent where she or he was asleep unconscious held against her will or threatened with violence the previous defence of honest or mistaken belief however unreasonable such a belief might be has been replaced by a test of reasonableness with extensive consultation and widespread support we have changed the law on sexual offences the challenge now is to effectively enforce sex offence laws what is critical is the effective partnerships between all those involved the police you in the cps the courts and the health services victims support and the witness service the statutory agencies and the voluntary sector all the parts of the system need to work together to ensure rape victims get the support they need and get justice and ensure that perpetrators know they cant get away with it in all areas now the local criminal justice boards are working together strengthening partnerships between chief constables and chief crown prosecutors and courts prison and probation at local level the cps are giving advice to the police earlier on in a case to ensure that the right evidence is gathered and the appropriate charge laid soon you will all be framing the charge from the outset great strides have been made in the police treatment of rape investigations and in the cps all rape cases are now handled by you experienced designated specialist rape prosecutors what is important too is that there is continuity of the prosecutor the caseworker and prosecuting counsel in the case id like to thank all of you who have played your part in drawing up the new cps rape policy it is the result of widespread consultation both within and outside the cps and will mark a further improvement in the way rape is tackled what continues to be important in tackling sex offences is ensuring that there is good partnership working ensuring continuity of the different members of the team in a case ensuring that all the team are properly trained ensuring that the victim is properly supported and kept informed throughout there needs to be continuity not just of police and prosecutors but also of counsel through the earliest stage right through to trial and the dpp has this week issued new guidance requiring that only the most senior counsel and those with the proper level of sensitivity and expertise are used in rape cases and their performance before and in court is effectively monitored this is necessary to support the victim as she is likely to face a defence in which she is accused of lying where an acquittal may leave her feeling stigmatised not just as a liar but as having consented to sex in circumstances which are repugnant to her such as consent to sex with a complete stranger with a close family member or with a group the prosecution of rape depending as it sometimes does on his word against hers is challenging i am struck by the many cases that i see where the specialist rape prosecutor working at the centre of a team which includes the police but also the support services for the victims undertakes the often extraordinary difficult task of enabling a case to come to court by helping a traumatised victim have the confidence that her interests will be protected by a professional prosecution team working in partnership some truly remarkable cases are seeing offenders brought to justice when in the past it may have been thought impossible such as where the victims are abroad terrified or even after the victim has died but im struck too and share the incredulity with which some prosecutors tell me of some of your cases where there was clear forensic evidence and yet the jury still acquitted eg it clearly helps the victim and also the prospects of a successful prosecution where there is a sexual assault referral centre such as the haven in kings college hospital which serves my constituency i want to pay particular tribute to the work of dr jan welsh who will be speaking to you later the care and attention she and her team provide to every victim means not only that they are well looked after and issues such as emergency contraception sexually transmitted disease and cuts and bruises dealt with but also forensic evidence is taken and carefully preserved in many cases it may be by chance sometimes many years later that the same dna will come onto the national database and lead to the apprehension of the victim there are now sexual assault referral centres in operation and by the end of this year more will have opened up i was privileged to open the new centre in walsall earlier this month next to the hospital it is nevertheless in a separate building which also houses the local rape crisis centre we expect with the support of both the police and the nhs to see more of those special measures for victims in court such as allowing victims to give their evidence from behind a screen or on video can help sustain cases which would otherwise stand no chance of getting to court but it is of course vital to think carefully about such applications and to make clear to the court why it is necessary for such measures to be allowed the court needs not only to be prepared to grant the application but also to be clear why it was necessary so that there can be no misunderstanding if there is an acquittal in the face of the evidence that the case was jeopardised by special measures which were not actually necessary all the difficulties of coping with the aftermath of rape effect men who are raped and the shame and stigma that still affects so many rape victims is magnified for men i suspect that it is even harder for a man to admit that he has been raped and the cases ive dealt with where a young man has been the victim have shown that rape victims need high levels of help and support to enable them give evidence in court and try and move on in their lives im very pleased that we have a representative from mankind at this conference to talk about this further and how we can work together to support male victims of rape and sustain prosecutions where the victim is a man the sexual offences act came into effect in may this year we want to ensure that we dont after a flurry of debate about this in parliament simply move on to the next issues we want to ensure the act is working how it was intended and will to support those of you who are enforcing it so the home secretary has set up a ministerial group chaired by baroness scotland which monitors the progress of tackling rape it includes as well as home office ministers and myself ministers from the departments of health constitutional affairs and education we will monitory how the act is working and support those of you who are enforcing it id like finally to turn to the question of sentencing the sentencing advisory panel is consulting and will make recommendations on the sentencing of the offences in the new sexual offences act they will have the benefit of the court of appeal judgment in the case of milberry which sets out the new starting points in rape cases after a trial years without any aggravating or mitigating features years where there are some aggravating features such as rape of a child or by a person in a position of trust or by a group and years for serial rapes and those likely to remain a danger it is of course important that the courts sentence appropriately in every case including rape cases where there is generally speaking a lack of confidence amongst victims as to whether the criminal justice system will take their complaint seriously the attorney general lord goldsmith and i can as law officers refer to the court of appeal sentences which we regard as unduly lenient this is an exceptional jurisdiction only to be exercised in the public interest the court of appeal can then confirm the original sentence or increase it so bear in mind that you or indeed anyone can refer a case to us and we will consider it seriously but we can only refer it within days of the sentence i hope that working together we can make progress on getting to grips with tackling the crime of rape and i hope that you have a productive debate over the rest of the day much progress has been made and i thank you for your work i am full of admiration for your commitment and determination which i see as i come to your areas to hear about your work it is one of the great privileges for me as solicitor general to be working with you we have made much progress but there is more to do,2004-06,im pleased able today occasion launch new cps policy

there is only one sure start centre along the east lindsey coastal ribbon that covers miles of rural lincolnshire and is home to children the centre is on the coast at ingoldmells and opened three years ago to provide preschool care daycare and family support the nearest towns are lincoln miles away and sleaford miles away the distances families and social care workers would have to travel to use the centre means it has no option but to operate differently to its urban counterparts there is the alphabet bus a mobile play scheme that goes to the children in urban areas children would travel to the scheme support for parents learning to drive through financial help to sit the driving test and a free taxistyle transport scheme run by volunteers that ferries families in the sure start area to hospital visits doctor and dentist appointments essential shopping trips swimming and school east lindsey coastal ribbon programme manager angela hickin says its not so much that our services are different to urban areas its how we deliver them its about thinking creatively about how you get clients to you because we cannot provide services within prampushing distance rural areas face needing more centres to reach their dispersed population and the fact that the population in those areas is often too small to warrant opening a new centre as hickin says why would you spend on a new underfives centre that might serve only children of the sure start programmes in england just are rural reaching up to under fours instead of up to in urban areas a further rural minisure start projects linked to existing services were funded by the government following a rural white paper in calling for rural proofing to ensure policies such as sure start take account of rural circumstances however according to a report launched last week by the countryside agency on the state of rural england there has been little improvement in the provision of services in the countryside over recent years some of rural households remain km from a post office in and are km from a gps surgery in while forthcoming research on the governments childrens fund to tackle child poverty is expected to reveal that just of services are in rural areas among rural children live below the poverty threshold and a major problem is that the deprivation is often hidden the index of multiple deprivation reflects urban experience of crime and adverse physical environment neither of which are huge issues in the countryside mark shucksmith professor of land economy at aberdeen university says the scale of the index is insufficiently detailed to capture deprived areas in the countryside alastair cox policy adviser at the countryside agency adds we dont feel the index takes in the full picture in rural areas there are large areas with a lot of wealth but small pockets of deprivation its fine on a national level but the deprivation gets hidden by wealth in rural districts as a result says caroline abrahams director of public policy at the charity nch if youve got m to spend the temptation is to spend it in urban areas where disadvantage is concentrated and its easier to see its impact yet shucksmith believes that issues facing young people in rural areas are in many ways similar to those in urban areas access to education and training employment housing and welfare in addition of rural parishes have no youth groups or clubs and a lack of transport breeds a culture of isolation access to transport and leisure issues of identity and the visibility of living in small communities should be added to the list he says unlike sure start the majority of the governments connexions projects designed to target to yearolds with a one stop advice service are now thought to be reaching the countryside according to cox connexions emphasis on onetoone advice from anything from careers to family problems has made it one of the success stories a countryside agency report last year praised its specialist personal advisers for engaging isolated teenagers particularly through transport schemes such as moped loan projects which allow youngsters to travel to job interviews and take on work they they would otherwise have to turn down connexions activity in rural areas demonstrates good practice in tailor ing its priorities to suit local needs specialist personal advisers provide intensive support and a gateway to local experts says the report the implementation of connexions in rural areas it also praises connexions strategy of taking account of the views of young people individually and collectively as the new service is developed and as it is operated locally transport is as much of a difficulty for social care practitioners as it is for their clients in the countryside outreach work demands a bigger transport budget and more evening and weekend work for staff engaged in home visits early lessons from sure start found that one health promotion officer was travelling to homes that were a minimum of miles from her base reducing the number of possible visits by a third compared to those possible in urban areas poor transport links make recruitment that much harder says mark cozens lincolnshire sure start coordinator its more difficult than an urban centre theres no railway link to the main town mablethorpe and most of the roads are minor winding roads used by tractors and combine harvesters because east lindsey sure start staff spend so much time on home visits they receive a a year car allowance the scheme is advertising for a midwife post and will consider including travel to work time within the working day lincolnshire county council is examining how it can reduce the number of work hours that staff spend in a car colin pettigrew director of children and families is considering video conferencing between social services and education staff who work in remote locations the social services team also has a laptop scheme where foster children and carers can communicate online so youngsters in care can keep in touch with their friends by email and foster parents can keep in touch with social services but even when the use of it might be a solution to link disparate communities setup costs can be higher than in urban areas and unreliable signals and network connections can prove more problematic other solutions include colocating services or sharing staff such as midwives between projects says pettigrew in east lindsey however they are taking a more urbancentric approach under sure starts m capital fund they plan to

working parents could have a personal adviser to help them find childcare and negotiate flexible working with their employer under a scheme being considered by the government parent direct would offer telephone helplines and a facetoface service to help millions of working parents who say that they do not know where to find the information to help them juggle work and family responsibilities said patricia hewitt the secretary for trade and industry the idea still in its earliest stages emerged both from nationwide roundtable discussions led by the department of trade and industry and in the labour partys big conversation meetings in which the public have been debating issues of worklife balance with ministers ms hewitt is anxious to ensure that parents know how to take advantage of the package of familyfriendly measures introduced in april which include the right for parents of children under six to request flexible work the idea is that parent direct could initially build on existing helplines millions of people need to get working hours which suit their families parent direct would be modelled on the idea of the personal adviser which has been very successful in the new deal for lone parents they would help mothers and fathers and possibly help sort out a package with employers said ms hewitt ideally we would combine telephone advice and facetoface advice from a personal adviser theres a real need for better information the scheme might even be extended to carers said ms hewitt after receiving reports of a citizens jury in nottingham commissioned by the dti last week which highlighted the plight of carers there are million people trying to combine work with caring for an elderly or disabled relative while another million have had to give up their work to care the total number of carers in the uk is predicted to grow from million to million in the next years as the population ages the value of the care has been put at bn the position of carers needs urgent crossdepartmental consideration to identify what can be done to improve the carers allowance and protect the carers own pension if they are forced to give up work said ms hewitt last month tony blair suggested the right to request flexible working might be extended to carers relatives save the state millions of pounds that would otherwise have to go in running more homes and services for elderly or disabled people we need to broaden our family agenda its very important that our family policy focuses on the full range of family responsibilities she added she is hoping to use the success of the reforms working parents in the first year used the right to request flexible working to push for progress on worklife balances in the manifesto options being considered include extending the twoweek paternity leave or improving paid maternity leave britain still has one of the most meagre allocations of paid leave in the eu the whole issue of support for families will be a major issue at the next election and in a third term said ms hewitt but there will be difficult decisions about priorities more childcare or more respite care these things cost money,2004-06,working

just when women thought it was safe to consider themselves equal along comes research that suggests that they are anything but thirty years after the equal pay act made it illegal to pay women less than men payfindercom has found that the average pay gap between the sexes now stands at and that it is continuing to grow between and it had risen by in wales in the west midlands in the southeast and in scotland payfinder the anonymous service that allows workers to compare salaries on its website comments that it is incredible that this genderlinked pay differential even exists for women the extent of the problem may be shocking but the gap itself is less of a surprise amanda bailey personal secretary to the governor of lincoln prison knows all about it i have worked here for years and have always been aware of the substantial pay difference between men and women she says i assumed that it was always going to be that way however while amanda accepted this for almost three decades she is now doing something about it i am involved in an unequal pay action against the prison service with other employees she says as a member of the public and commercial services union i was asked if i would become a lead applicant in fighting the pay inequalities i agreed because i felt that it was my duty to do something we have to do what we can to resolve this our tribunal ended last week so we are waiting for the results hopefully it will go our way it is clear from amandas experience that even where there are longstanding inequalities it is never too late to do something about them there are many reasons for the gender pay gap job segregation discrimination against parttimers and outdated pay systems are as much to blame as the hopefully dying breed of employers who believe that women arent as valuable as their male counterparts yet rather than wait for the government or employers to start redressing the balance women are taking action themselves gone though are the days of tying themselves to railings this generation of female activists has much more effective tricks up its sleeve jenny watson deputy chairman of the equal opportunities commission explains employers are running out of excuses when they defend unequal pay there is a lot of awareness about inequality and there are tools and support for employers who want to resolve it all they have to do is take action and if they dont well there are a few things that you can do to persuade them although it is accepted that the responsibility for change lies with employers it is vital that women challenge inequality creating pressure for reform it is important for you to take control explains watson but do your homework first start with checking your pay visit the eoc site and enter your salary into our paygap calculator set up with payfinder it will tell you what you should be paid for your work and will compare it with what men get for equivalent jobs also talk to your female colleagues to see if they are experiencing problems they could shed some light on the issue in addition to this if you get on well with your male colleagues compare your salary with theirs but check that you are doing the same job or different jobs at the same level so that you have a true comparison it is also worth checking bonuses it is at this stage that you can also enlist the help of your employer ask them to fill in our equal pay questionnaire says watson it requests information about whether you are receiving equal pay you may find out that you have nothing to worry about but until then you will never know employees are legally entitled to ask for information about whether they are paid equally and if not why not this questionnaire has an eightweek time limit for responses although there is no obligation on employers to reply however if they dont and you decide to take things further a tribunal can draw inferences from a deliberate refusal to answer or an evasive reply but before you buy a new suit for the court appearance you should explore other ways of resolving the situation start with a cool and calm discussion with your employer many do not realise that they are paying unequally thanks to flawed pay systems jenny watson believes that because of this many employers are pleased to have inequalities brought to their attention however organisations that are serious about the issue go on to hold pay reviews that means comparing the pay of men and women doing equal work finding what causes pay gaps and working to close them one company that has done this successfully is bmw we want to be the worlds most attractive employer so we did a pay review at our oxford plant to demonstrate how serious we are about looking after our employees explains peter lewis hr manager at bmw we have people on site and only of those are women but the review showed that we are doing a good job of paying equally and the few problems that arose were due to anomalies in the system we resolved them and we can now tell people that we really are committed to equality in the workplace if onetoone discussion fails it may be time to rally the troops the chances are that your female colleagues have fallen foul of the same system so use your influence as a group the more visible you are the stronger you are if that fails it could be time to call the eoc the tuc or your own trade union they can advise you about how best to tackle the situation and provide you with representation at meetings legal advice and even financial help if you decide to take your case to a tribunal yet while this discursivelegal route may be the cure for unequal pay prevention is best increasingly employers do not specify rates of pay on job ads which means salary is open to negotiation this is a problem because women consistently undersell themselves and if a woman does not secure a salary comparable to her male counterparts right at the beginning of her employment with a company then the chances are high that she never will the eoc has even found that only five years after starting work there is a pay gap between male and female graduates with the same degrees and doing the same jobs while educating employers goes a good way towards resolving inequality educating women about the issue is also vital and campaigns are being run among female students informing them of what they should be paid and how to negotiate for it it is also about telling women that years after the equal pay act it is within their power to fight for what is equally theirs if i have one thing to say to anyone in the same position as me says amanda bailey it is do something about it i am proud of what i am doing to be torn between employer loyalty and what you want can be a moral dilemma and i admit that i have had moments of doubt but i know that this is the right thing to do it is hard work and you may have to face your fears but its worth it for you and the women who will benefit from what you had the strength to do for help and advice equal opportunities commission wwweocorguk tel payfinder see wwwpayfindercom tuc see wwwworksmartorguk tel,2004-06,woman thought wa safe consider equal along come

rapists are to face tougher jail terms under a government crackdown on judges accused of not taking date rapes seriously enough harriet harman the solicitorgeneral told the observer attackers who know their victims are too often being let off with brief sentences despite evidence that being attacked by a colleague or acquaintance is as traumatic as rape by a stranger she will commit the governments law officers to acting as a safety net for women using littleknown powers to refer sentences to the court of appeal which can impose longer jail terms to send a message to judges that rape must be taken seriously i want people to be confident that if they have the courage to take a case to court the system will back them up and if the sentence is not right we are there as a safety net she said there is a real new focus on making sure justice is done sentencing guidelines suggest rape should attract a minimum sentence of five years rising to eight years if the attacker was in a position of trust such as a teacher or boss and up to years for serial offenders harman pointed to cases such as that of a yearold man who met a girl of in an internet chatroom after lying about his age and later coerced her into sleeping with him he was sentenced to just three years in prison plus two years on licence in another case a man who raped his estranged wife on a holiday and then stabbed her was given four years both cases were referred to the court of appeal by the attorneygenerals office and the sentences increased harmans decision will encourage many more victims to challenge sentences although she risks being criticised for interfering in judges decisions relations between the government and the senior judiciary are already frosty with judges complaining of political meddling harman will argue when she launches new crown prosecution service guidelines on prosecuting rape later this month that women will not testify if they fear their attackers will be out of prison again soon she believes that since changes to the law were introduced last month making it easier to secure convictions the challenge now is to demonstrate the courts take them seriously harman will argue the evidence suggests it is not rapes by strangers which attract unduly lenient sentences but those where the victim and offender are known to each other women are at far greater risk of attack from men they know yet acquaintance rape is less likely to lead to a conviction with juries often apparently readier to believe that a woman willingly consented to sex when it is a question of her word against that of a friend or partner harman will also outline plans to train prosecuting lawyers in sensitive handling of victims ensuring they prevent the defence from mounting an inappropriate or irrelevant crossexamination such as questioning of victims about their past sex lives she will argue that sex attack victims are uniquely vulnerable not only because they are likely to have embarrassing details laid bare in court but also because if the attacker in acquitted they can be left feeling stigmatised not just as a liar but as having consented to sex in circumstances which are repugnant to her while defendants can routinely appeal against jail terms victims may not realise they have any way of challenging the sentence the attorney and the solicitorgeneral can refer cases only if a complaint is made to them within days of sentencing either by a lawyer or interested parties although the court of appeal is not obliged to raise the sentence it must reconsider it and cannot reduce it,2004-06,rapist face tougher jail term government crackdown judge accused taking date rape seriously enough harriet harman solicitorgeneral told observer attacker know victim often let

first direct bank has opened the largest corporate workplace nursery in the uk children aged between three months and five years can play paint or learn french and baby yoga while their parents work in the same building meanwhile sandwell council has recently announced that in addition to its eminent workplace creche and holiday play scheme it is developing an outofschool service comprising a breakfast club and afterschool facility so as we hear of more and more employers introducing allsinging alldancing childcare facilities can we assume that the problems of working parents in the uk are coming to an end sue underhill family support officer at sandwell council says parents who use their services certainly benefit the creche was singled out as a model of excellent practice by ofsted she points out its not just the convenience and cost of the creche that suits parents she says we just heard the other day that three of our past babies have got into grammar school and one of the mothers said it was all down to us that the child had the confidence to do anything after coming through our creche but irene pilia deputy chief executive of the campaigning charity working families argues that onsite facilities for children arent necessarily the answer if you live far from work it isnt always ideal to take a young child on long journeys and less still to leave them for the duration of a whole working day she says this isnt helped by the fact that uk employees are trapped in a longhours culture new research from delivery firm ups found that almost half of british workers spend more time at work than they did five years ago ms pilia adds that when young children are looked after away from their own communities they may have problems when they start school because they have no friends there im not making the case against workplace nurseries she stresses it can be a terrific thing to be offered but they dont automatically rid working parents of all problems michelle roman a pa in berkshire agrees i was thrilled when my little girl got into our workplace creche but i actually found it more difficult to work knowing she was in the next building also the creche doesnt encourage visits from parents because it can upset the children and that made me feel policed eventually i took her out and opted for another childcare alternative whether or not workplace childcare facilities are the solution latest figures from the department of trade and industry show that less than of companies offer them anyway despite the publicity given to those that do and most have lengthy waiting lists both the charity working families and the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd conclude that most working parents still face huge challenges with childcare notably costs availability and access pilia explains ive personally taken the government to task on many issues but i would argue that they have done a huge amount for working parents particularly in ensuring flexible working patterns are much more of a reality nonetheless we still have a long way to go and these are the three issues that appear to pose the biggest problems whether parents opt for nannies childminders private nurseries workplace nurseries after school clubs school holiday clubs or mothers helps there are also the problems of children falling ill or the person minding your children letting you down at the last minute notes dianah worman diversity adviser for the cipd the more we depend on childcare during working hours the more of a risk this becomes she says in fact a growing number of employers are recognising this and are reminding staff of their legal right to emergencycare leave and in cases where the staff member doesnt want to give up the working day they may be encouraged to work from home some employers are even allowing employees to bring their child to work which in theory is great but if youve got deadlines to meet people to phone and meetings to attend it can be very difficult to manage as many working parents are learning the hard way meanwhile many working fathers face the problem of not being taken seriously ask your employer how many working fathers are on the payroll and the chances are says working families the figure isnt known and the issue has never even been thought about it claims that we cling on to the old pattern of family breadwinner forgetting the role working dads now play in the home claims the charity consequently not only are men less likely to ask for flexible working patterns they are also much more likely to be turned down when they do according to the charitys research a recent report from the work foundation found that even where flexible working practices are on offer todays generation of working fathers is unlikely to take them up they are missing out on time with their children because they believe that bosses discriminate against men with childcare responsibilities explains the author of the report richard reeves the answer to meeting working parents childcare needs lies in a picknmix format working families and the cipd have concluded with employers understanding that one size doesnt fit all ideally they should do indepth studies of the profile of their staff and thoroughly investigate their needs and opinions only then will working parents problems really start coming

over the next few months the women who work in scotlands media companies will be asked some pointed questions about their jobs the answers could be illuminating and depressing the study by researchers at aberdeen university has been prompted by concerns that women in the profession are still disadvantaged because of their gender changes in the media and communications industries have created opportunities for women said professor rita marcella of aberdeen business school who is leading the research yet evidence suggests they are still failing to achieve equity with men in terms of entry retention and progression the surveys results are likely to be published next year separate research released this week revealed the true width of the yawning pay gap that exists between men and women in scotland figures from salary data collectors payfindercom showed that while the pay gap across the uk had risen by in the past year to an average of in scotland it now stands at alyson thomson of the equal opportunities commission in scotland says such findings are disturbing but not surprising thirty years after legislation was enacted that was supposed to end sexual discrimination and bring about equal pay in the workplace too many women are still being treated as secondclass employees it is sometimes just straightforward sex discrimination women are paid less because they are women ms thomson said we also have a lot of women clustered in lowpay lowvalue jobs like catering cleaning childcare and the work that women do is valued much less therefore their pay is much less related to all of that is the fact that women are still doing the majority of caring work which only enables them to do parttime jobs and in scotland for parttime women there is a pay gap per hour compared to a man working full time that is a shocking statistic that keeps women earning so much less although scotland has one of the highest rates of female political representation in the world almost of holyroods msps are women few women are in positions of real authority across the public and private sectors the day after the scottish media survey was unveiled scotlands police forces announced they were launching a campaign to improve their record of promoting women said to be the worst in the uk one in five police constables in scotland is a woman but half of the countrys police forces have no women above the level of chief inspector in england and wales women make up of superintendents and chief superintendents in scotland the figure is there is only one female assistant chief constable norma graham of central scotland police the association of chief police officers in scotland acpos said it recognised that women were still underrepresented at managerial level and efforts were under way to redress the situation linda fabiani of the scottish national party who has campaigned on the issue said the acpos initiative was welcome but long overdue and something that should be repeated across scotland policing change i guess it is partly a cultural thing she said we still very much have the view that the conventional family is whats best the man going out to work and the woman doing a parttime job or staying at home and i think it takes a long long time to shift that it is getting better but it is a long slow process and we really have to take action to make it quicker thats why i really welcome what acpos have said it has been a long time coming but at least something is happening now people say you cant force these things but we have now had three decades of equal pay legislation and we still have women paid a lot less we still have places where there is no equality at all we still have glass ceilings in all the professions ms thomson said the onus was on employers to ensure they are treating female and male employees fairly employers must do equal pay reviews she said they must do a job evaluation so what they are doing is comparing the value of the work and if they failed to ensure that pay and progression systems are equitable she warned they faced costly employment tribunals where there was no ceiling on the amount of compensation that could be awarded to wronged employee not to mention potential loss of credibility and standing quite simply the damage to companies reputations can be huge she said,2004-06,next month woman work scotland medium company

they are the women who thought they had it all for a generation who had enjoyed far more freedom and money than their own mothers they imagined an easy life in their forties and fifties but the reality for thousands is that they end up trying to care for children at the same time as looking after increasingly elderly parents the sandwich generation are the women in their late forties and early fifties who find themselves caught between conflicting demands of holding down a job and caring for both older and younger family members increasing dissatisfaction over the demands faced by this generation of women is rising up the political agenda tony blair is now drawing up a package of support for sandwich mothers and older carers aimed at enabling more of them to work and preventing a pensions crisis in later years matthew taylor the downing street aide in charge of drawing up labours election manifesto recently had talks with carers uk a pressure group its a new frontier of the welfare state said one source close to downing street the first priority is a big increase in support for people with responsibilities it means respite care so that they can get a break then you get on to things like the right to flexible working but there is also the enormous problem of how the sandwich generation can build up enough pension provision when thousands of women in their late forties are forced to work parttime often on fairly low wages while patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary has suggested giving carers for elderly relatives the same rights as working mothers to request reduced hours at work downing street is also studying options such as special pension credits for women whose caring responsibilities mean that they cannot work imelda redmond chief executive of carers uk said there were more women trying to juggle responsibility for parents and children at the same time we call them the sandwich generation they are being squidged from both ends the tories are also study ing plans for carers pension credits theresa may tory spokeswoman on the family said sandwichers were under extra tension because they often live far away from elderly parents when people increasingly live at a distance from elderly relatives the stresses increase there are several demographic factors which have created the growing problem of people caught between trying to care for parents at the same time as bringing up children the first is that the average age of women having their first child has risen to more than at the same time the generation born between the world wars had relatively high fertility rates and their children are more likely to have survived into middle age statistics suggest that one in four women aged from to provides unpaid care for a family member one million spend more than hours a week doing so whether for their own children or for an elderly parent the government policy is to extend flexible working rights to midlife carers of older people which will help them with the worklife balance however parttime workers accumulate little or no additional pension compared to fulltime workers and if they are earning below the lower earnings limit and not caring full time they may not even get the credits to their basic state pension the problem experts say is that these women have no opportunity to build up solid pension provision with lengthy periods of fulltime work at a reasonable rate of pay one of those who know what it is like to face the demands of caring is linda lascelles as chief executive of the charity afasic which helps children with speech and language difficulties she is able to work from home for part of the week this enables her to see a lot of her yearold father who has parkinsons disease as well as her daughter who has speech and language impairment last year was particularly hard for lascelles when her mother was given weeks to live after being suddenly diagnosed with lung cancer lascelles said people have been caring for relatives for generations but it isnt acknowledged nursing sick or elderly parents is a very important role but its almost hidden within our society as if its taboo it was very important for me that i could care for my parents and it was important for them what else matters in life if it isnt your family ive been lucky because i had flexible working but for many women that isnt possible and juggling the demands of daily life can become very stressful the charity age concern which will publish a manifesto this autumn demanding a fairer deal for older people is also backing a carers pension for those with responsibilities for elderly relatives this really is a runner for the parties it would send a clear political message on an issue which is

domestic violence cases are not being dealt with properly by the probation service a report claimed today national targets for dealing with domestic violence cases are being missed and plans on how to manage the risks are poor according to the chief inspector of probations team only of cases sampled by the inspection team were rated good and none were rated excellent only of cases sampled gave sufficient consideration to the safety of the victim when there were children in the household the risk of harm to them was only analysed in of cases only of cases were reassessed after another incident took place that caused concern the report said assessments of the likelihood of further harm were generally substandard and discussions on the history of offending were not checked with other sources or previous probation records the most common reason given for this was a lack of time for proper research the chief inspector of probation andrew bridges said the findings of this inspection show there is much room for improvement a local government report also released this week has shown that councils are failing to reduce the number of repeat victims of domestic violence the lga report described reducing repeat victimisation as the greatest challenge the problem is even more serious in cases of women with mental health problems and drug misuse a womens aid report revealed that only a fifth of refuge organisations would accommodate women who had mental health problems if they had space however almost of women who have mental health problems experience domestic violence a report

children hate it when parents argue they hate it when they separate or divorce even more but if that ideal is shattered and their parents no longer live together they at least want them to get on it is impossibly hard for a child living with one parent she loves to hear that parent repeatedly badmouthing the other parent whom she also loves intuitively the child knows she needs both parents but if forced to make a choice her loyalty will be to the one with whom she lives security of the known is safer than the unknown for most children because she feels responsible for looking after her unhappy resident parent the child will when asked echo what that parent wants to hear not what she really feels and in time may come to believe it you are the governments wife and youve come to help me said one sixyearold child to the court professional visiting her home if proposals for changing how the law protects children caught up in divorce are accepted will children be right to trust the government the governments green paper parental separation childrens needs and parents responsibilities is a turning point in family law the courts will be obliged to focus more on the child than ever before frequent and continuous contact with both parents is to be the childs right the child will never again be the wholly owned subsidiary of either parent so will things improve for the child dismayed when loved parents part often they cannot believe what is happening it can cause great trauma to have one of their pillars of security wrenched from them death divorce and moving house are the three greatest stresses for adults but divorce especially inflicts damage on a young child a parenting relationship in the mind of the child endures for the rest of its life the child had two parents before they need two parents after separation later in life teenagers separated from one parent will say they had always wanted to see their other parent but dared not ask because of the consequences meaning they feared the angry reaction of their main parent the new scheme is right to assume that the best hope of ensuring a child still has two parents after divorce is to get in early the court and the family will work together the court will support and guide separating parents to develop a parenting partnership through early therapeutic education and mediation sessions before the strain of separation begins to affect the child one sixyearold girl said it was her fault her father had left home as he was worried about banking and my being so little overhearing her parents rowing about money and banking and complaining about the demands of looking after a small child like her she blamed herself and missed her daddy a lot in contrast she felt her yearold brother was old enough to look after himself in this familys case which is not exceptional each parent had ferocious and partly true criticisms of the other but the little girl loved both of them the childs therapist advised her parents how responsible their little daughter felt for their breakup this softened each parents attitude enabling them to begin to agree to childcentred plans overseas family courts have for the past decade or so been proactive in helping parents support their childs essential family relationships after separation the british government recognises that our separating parents also stand to gain learning about parenting in a restructured family and about how to enable their childs family ties to be sustained means their child can keep loving and respecting both parents even when one or other parent forms a new relationship in the future modern parents facing divorce need these lessons more than ever before the social scaffolding of the s which supported the childs family life has gone nowadays it is the norm to see serial monogamy families in transition stepfamilies and a growing number of children who experience two parental divorces before they reach in some states in the us this occurs with of children the continuity and stability of key adults in a childs life gives inner strength break these childadult bonds and the childs resilience is undermined increasing susceptibility to societys temptations in adulthood the tales of adults loading their own arguments on to their children are tragic and common a little girl of five with no memory of her father at home he left before she was two recalls the huge excitement of seeing him once a month on a sunday best clothes best behaviour it meant seeing her father was a treat she relished of course she loved her mother and stepdad but she found it awful returning to her stepdads rant you stink of smoke did he take you to the pub did he give you money she would run to her room crying acrimony between parents upsets children and adults it spreads into school and workplace and putting this right is profoundly important every child of divorce wants parents to sort things out emotionally bruised angry and upset people are seldom able to plan for their child without outside help even those separating parents who can reach agreement may not see coparenting and enduring family ties as their priority two years after the breakup of postseparation children have little or no contact with their other parent not all of the family courts critics are won over however while moderate campaign groups have welcomed the green paper bob geldof and some fathers rights activists castigate its failure to announce shared parenting legislation to inform society that now by law sharedparenting rules apply sharedparenting laws were passed in overseas countries in the s and practice reforms followed the uks green paper proposes the reverse order reforms piloted first then a sharedparenting statute if necessary could come in a future parliamentary session the principle in the green paper is universal all children should have meaningful relationships with key adults in their family provided it is safe frequent and continuous contact between the child and the other parent must be maintained one sevenyearold boy who lives with his mother acts up at handovers but hugely loves his dad when there is an overlap with his parents together this permissiongiving helps the child settle in many examples of postdivorce parenting are like this one common sense for they are everyday happenings in many families delayed resolutions are deadly this is when separating parents attitudes harden leaving the child caught in the crossfire the government has signalled that the courts will now intervene early before the parents get embroiled in adversarial litigation in florida family courts are particularly quick off the mark separating parents are sent a temporary order requiring them to sustain frequent and continuous contact between the child and both families until such time as a coparenting agreement or final court order is made the state requires parental cooperation that is right for the child and its courts have a therapeutic justice practice of coworking with educators and special mediators to bring this about parents attend a group parent orientationclass but not necessarily together orientation means adjusting to a new kind of separation parenting and emphasises the benefits to the child of enlightened coparenting based upon research findings about children of divorce then follows a onehour parenting planning guidance session taken with a mediator the parents task is to agree a timetable for their child which fits societys expectations and the familys needs thereafter finetuning negotiation takes place with a parenting facilitator and a return to court only occurs in extreme cases all this helps the parents to reach an early agreement which lasts when parents know of the courts expectations and attend classes about the effect on children of separation and are guided by skilled mediators who are there not for therapy or relationship building but to conduct childfocused parenting planning then even hostile parents can and do plan well for their children the crucial change in the green paper is that our family courts will now make it a priority to sustain the family ties of the child of divorce the child is the courts focus and their existing relationship is expected to continue from the outset unless there is a good reason to suspend contact the green paper theory may be fine but practice is quite another matter the governments proposals need to have teeth if they are to work skilled people of mettle are needed to drive the reforms forward alongside professionals who precisely focus their work on coparenting not forgetting the grandparents the prize will be that the next generation of children with separated parents and there will be a very large number should benefit from calmer parenting and become happier and more stable adults,2004-07,child hate parent argue hate separate divorce even ideal shattered parent longer live together

bosses should be given more help on how to handle pregnant staff according to the head of britains antisexism watchdog who believes that mep godfrey blooms controversial warnings against hiring women struck a chord with employers julie mellor chair of the equal opportunities commission eoc said blooms suggestion that women belonged in the home cleaning behind the fridge had rightly brought outrage the ukip mep went on to insist that no employer with a brain would want to hire a lady of childbearing age in case she had a baby however mellor said bloom may have tapped into more widespread worries among employers about whether staff who had children would hold down a job parents dont want either godfrey bloom or the government telling them what to do this demonstrates that a lot of discrimination is still going on she said but what we have found is that employers are worried that an employee coming back to work after having a baby is not going to be reliable because of the lack of affordable childcare we have to remember that per cent of women end up giving up their jobs because they cannot balance their caring responsibilities her comments which came as the prime minister yesterday launched a taskforce to investigate the needs of working women will trigger fierce debate over the rights and wrongs of gender warfare in the office however it follows a wideranging eoc investigation into the treatment of pregnant women due to be published in september mellor said small businesses in britain now employ more women than men but it was clear such firms needed more help in handling the costs and practicalities of maternity leave the government should consider offering help with the cost of finding temps to cover for a woman on maternity leave she said a national network of childcare as reliable as the nhs would also enable women to return to work with confidence and convince bosses that they would not be let down mellor said it would be impossi ble to tackle low pay the main aim of blairs new commission without tackling other issues affecting working women such as the long hours culture driving many into poorly paid parttime work women parttimers are the new underclass says the eoc earning a shocking per cent pro rata of what men get for the same job mellor argues however that the recent flood of court cases in britain suggest younger career women are not prepared to be stuck on the mummy track of low pay and no prospects mellor is now investigating the impact of the pay gap on men when women are cheated out of a higher salary their partners have to work more hours to make up the family income missing out on time with their children she says,2004-07,boss given help handle pregnant staff according head britain antisexism watchdog belief mep

civil legal aid bill legal aid would be available only for investigating a medical negligence case and patients who wanted to sue would have to find a lawyer to take it forward under a nowin nofee deal the plans outlined in a consultation paper from the department for constitutional affairs and the legal services commission aim to shift the emphasis of legal aid from court battles to settling cases through mediation and other forms of dispute resolution outside the courts methods of paying lawyers would be changed to make it more attractive for them to settle without litigation so that early and effective resolution outside the courts will become the favoured outcome for most cases the rule that allows the first of equity in an applicants home to be disregarded in deciding eligibility for legal aid would be abolished with exemptions for the most vulnerable civil legal aid has come under pressure from the ballooning cost of aid for criminal and asylum cases where the governments human rights obligations make cuts hard to impose one of the main aims of the consultation paper is to curb spending on divorce and family cases about of civil legal aid costs goes on

savings in legal aid yesterdays consultation paper estimates that up to of such cases which now go to court need not and should not really be there other proposals to encourage amicable and early resolution of family cases and to discourage unreasonable or wasteful behaviour include restricting legal aid for multiple applications over children to stop parents rushing back to court each time a

assets as security from a bank funding would no longer be available for drafting a divorce petition or finalising the paperwork needed for a divorce decree which many clients should be in a position to complete without the assistance of a lawyer the charity action against medical accident said the proposal to restrict legal aid in medical negligence cases would seriously damage access to justice the chief executive peter walsh said solicitors would take on only the most clear cut cases and access to justice would be denied to many with more complex cases who can be most in need and deserving of compensation patients applying for legal aid would have to go through the nhs complaints procedure first before their case could be considered for aid and anyone wanting legal aid to sue the police would first have to make a complaint to the independent police complaints commission the legal aid minister david lammy said we want to ensure that funds remain available for the most deserving cases and for those who face social exclusion the consultation ends on october and any changes would start to be introduced from the end of the year he said,2004-07,injured patient could lose right legal

a shakeup of the family justice system in england and wales to ensure that both parents maintain a meaningful relationship with their children after divorce or separation was unveiled by the government yesterday the plan outlined in a consultation paper aims to tackle disputes over child contact early before they become intractable parents who apply for court orders will be directed to go through incourt conciliation to work out their own parenting plans but the government has rejected a demand by some fathers groups and adopted by the conservative party for a presumption of equal parenting time lord falconer the constitutional affairs secretary said there cannot and will not be an automatic presumption of contact children cannot be divided like the furniture or the cd collection parents will be shown plans which have been found to work in a typical scenario the child may stay with the father every other weekend plus one weekday night alternate festive occasions and extended time during school holidays parents who want time would be free to do so the move follows a series of highprofile protests by the militant fathers group fathersjustice whose members threw a flour bomb at tony blair in the house of commons and years of lobbying by moderate groups matt oconnor founder of fathersjustice said he was profoundly disappointed that the government had failed to adopt parenting as a starting point and promised that his groups protests would dramatically escalate but duncan fisher director of fathers direct called the green paper a huge step for many parents who have had to fight for years for a level of contact that this green paper acknowledges as the norm jim parton of families need fathers said if they can pull it off it could make things a lot better the role of cafcass the children and family court advisory service would shift from writing reports for the contact disputes a year which go to court to supporting access for parents expected to reach outofcourt agreements a pilot project in three courts from september will try out more intensive interventions which will be introduced nationally if it succeeds the threestage programme will be piloted in county courts in sunderland and brighton and at wells street magistrates court in central london the scheme will not be mandatory but parents who apply for court orders will be directed by the judges that they will be expected to take part parents will be shown a video of children discussing their experiences following divorces to show them how divorce affects children they will undergo training in conflict management to help them learn skills to make postdivorce parenting less acrimonious both parents will come together with a cafcass officer to work out a parenting plan the green paper recognises this is unlikely to produce a onceforall solution and parents will be given continuing support if cases need to go to court they will be heard much more quickly than at present and the same judge will deal with a case throughout if possible under the law judges have two choices in enforcing contact orders fine the mother or send her to jail so orders are widely disregarded legislation is promised as soon as possible but lord falconer said he could not guarantee a bill in the next parliamentary session judges will be able to send parents who defy court orders to classes or counselling sessions or make a community service order requiring them to do voluntary work,2004-07,shakeup family justice system england wale ensure parent maintain meaningful relationship child

almost three decades ago british social reformers began campaigning for a more civilised system for resolving access disputes between separating parents the aim was to replace the conflict that an adversarial court process generated with a more conciliatory process using mediators the goal was not just to reduce the bitterness between separating parents but help their children too amicable access arrangements that allow children to keep in touch with separated parents help both the children and their parents in australia canada and parts of the us alternative dispute resolution procedures for separating parents sprang up and developed in the uk alas there was too little progress there is now some incourt conciliation that avoids the need for litigation but as the high court family division has noted there is still much that is wrong yesterdays green paper on parental separation would radically alter british procedures and belatedly help us achieve a more benign system under the current system up to separating couples of the annual total end up going to court to determine contact arrangements under the new system helplines and legal aid will be targeted to achieve resolution rather than litigation a new process will be piloted under which couples will be shown a video in which children explain the difficulties that parental conflict causes them it then moves on to teach parents conflict management skills that can defuse acrimony and then with the help of court support staff encourages couples to agree a parenting plan instead of the current system in which every case is deemed to be different parents will be shown access templates that courts usually follow according to the age of the children the working patterns of their parents and the travelling distance between the separate homes in florida where a similar system operates court hearings have shrunk dramatically it is not going to satisfy the more militant members of fathers justice who like the conservative party have been calling for a contact split between parents ministers rightly insist that children cannot be divided like furniture or cd collections but it will mean much more contact than exists now for non residential parents it should bring a belated reduction in the shameful statistic that of fathers lose touch with their children within two years of separation courts will be given a greater range of powers to ensure contact can be enforced where a parent is being awkward it looks a fair balance producing justice for children as well as fathers,2004-07,almost three

the government today rejected the idea of giving divorced parents equal access to their children ministers said that while children should keep in contact with both parents when a marriage breaks down they must not be treated like a cd collection that can be split the decision comes in a consultation paper on parenting rights published today which sets out measures intended to make contact disputes less adversarial the green paper parental separation childrens needs and parents responsibilities says parents should get more help to reach a settlement without recourse to the courts cases that do reach the courts should be dealt with more quickly and effectively and there should be more and tougher penalties for parents who do breach court orders and deny their former partner access to their children such as communitybased orders to carry out voluntary work proposals to help parents resolve access arrangements include extending incourt conciliation with more informal hearings before contested court cases developing parenting plans to give parents advice on contact arrangements found to have worked helplines and legal aid targeted on resolution rather than litigation speeding up first court appointments changing the role of the children and family court advisory and support service to provide more conciliation and support services ensuring one judge sees through cases to the end to provide continuity around of the parents who separate each year in england and wales end up going to court over contact disputes with their children the constitutional affairs secretary lord falconer the education secretary charles clarke and the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt believe childrens best interests are served by maintaining contact with both parents lord falconer said this is an extremely difficult complex and for those involved often a very painful process all the evidence shows the best solution in many cases is for parents to find their own solution where we can we will help with advice support and mediation recourse to the courts should be the last resort there cannot and will not be an automatic presumption of contact children cannot be divided like the furniture or the cd collection it is more complex than that ministers rejected conservative party proposals that fathers get equal access much to the anger of pressure groups like fathers justice fj which has mounted a direct action campaign to put pressure on the government to change contact arrangements matt oconnor the founder of fj said the government was failing to protect the best interests of children by denying fathers equality with mothers he told gmtv this is a cynical exercise in recycling the existing legislation and presenting it as reform the law has to have teeth there

partys chairman to represent mens rights on the influential committee he still needed to be voted in by the european parliament in order to take his seat as a member of the committee mr bloom explained that he would like to overturn eu maternity legislation if his position allowed he said maternity laws that gave women six months of paid leave and the option of another six months unpaid

highprofile member robert kilroysilk lost his bbc talk show after making controversial comments about arabs in which he labelled them women repressors a party spokesman backed off somewhat from mr blooms stance suggesting that an exemption for businesses with less than employees could solve much of the problem almost all companies must give female employees maternity leave which the spokesman said created an undue burden for some businesses liberal democrat mep baroness emma nicholson said she credited the eu for of the uks current maternity allowance and warned that she was ready to oppose mr bloom if he tried to dismantle it maternity leave is one of the most important provisions that the eu has brought in in an equal opportunities society both men and women have a right to exercise talents and earn money she said women could not afford to simply quit their jobs she said adding that she wondered if mr bloom would rather see mothers place their babies in state baby farms to allow them to go back to work more quickly labour mep glenys kinnock responded we always knew they were neanderthal but this guy is really outrageous and of course is suggesting something which

separated parents embroiled in disputes over their children will be taught conflict management skills in a pilot scheme that could if successful be rolled out throughout england and wales under the family resolution scheme starting in september at three courts couples will be encouraged to agree a parenting plan with help from cafcass the children and family court advisory and support service but to the great disappointment of fathers groups which have been campaigning for reform particularly for access to their children the scheme will not be mandatory fathers believe mothers determined to prevent their former partners seeing their children will simply refuse to take part in a second blow for fathers pressure groups a green paper on contact with children to be published this week rejects their demands for a presumption of parenting time the family resolution pilot projects were announced in april but the details not revealed until this week from september parents who apply to the brighton or sunderland county courts or wells street magistrates in london to resolve disputes over their children will be referred to a threestep programme the aim is to divert cases from court where it can take months to get a hearing date and help parents reach an early solution by teaching them how to focus on their childrens needs rather than their own and manage family conflict the first element is aimed at raising awareness of the childs viewpoint the adults will be shown a video of children aged talking about their parents divorce to show how contact can be made a positive experience for children there will then be group sessions led by specially trained facilitators with role play among fathers and mothers but not with their own former partners to help them avoid conflicts by learning what triggers anxiety in the other adult both parents will have an advice session with an officer from cafcass to try to work out a parenting plan cafcass officers now spend most of their time writing reports for court hearings in childrens cases under this scheme their role would shift more to handholding supplying continuing support for parents who would be invited to call them as problems occur rather than rush off to court the green paper will spell out government support for facilitating and encouraging frequent contact between children and the parent they no longer live with but stops short of advocating shared parenting or a presumption that children will spend of their time with each parent it says the key principle must remain the best interests of the child which means flexibility rather than parcelling youngsters out to meet the needs of adults a different pilot scheme the early intervention project which was supported by judges and modelled on a project in florida was to have gone ahead in september with the backing of the department of constitutional affairs in that scheme parents would have had no choice but to go through mediation but when the department for education and skills took over the issue a design group was set up and it went back to the drawing board judges who supported the early intervention scheme were dismayed to learn that the new scheme would not include mandatory mediation in a judgment last april detailing the failings of the family justice system a high court judge mr justice munby said he could understand why some were disappointed that the new proposals would only encourage the use of mediation not making it mandatory mavis maclean director of the centre for family law and policy at oxford university who leads the design group said that her group was not satisfied that the pilot could be made mandatory under current law existing conciliation schemes running in court in essex and other parts of the country showed that diverting cases from court became the norm even though participation was voluntary she said that studies of the essex scheme found that in almost of cases where parents were helped by cafcass those adults had managed to agree a parenting plan half the agreements later broke down but even in those cases the absent parent was found to be spending more time with the children following the agreement parenting is incredibly difficult for everybody and its even more difficult when you dont have a comfortable relationship with the other parent this is a tough one but for the sake of the children weve got to try anything we can ms maclean said,2004-07,separated parent embroiled dispute child taught conflict management skill pilot scheme could successful rolled throughout

norman glass is bemused the man credited with inventing the governments early years sure start programme is considering the suggestion made by some newspapers last week citing us research that nursery daycare for children under three is in danger of creating a breed of antisocial monsters the risks are so very slight glass sighs it is almost wicked to give the impression that by putting their kids into nursery mothers are breeding some kind of race of football hooligans terrorising the land glass an expert on early years child development doesnt really do angry but he is clearly unhappy with the direction in which some journalists have taken the debate it may be that id rather have a more boisterous child if i could earn sufficient to pay for healthier food and books he says there are always tradeoffs you cant just take one outcome measure he fears the way the research from the us national institute of child health and human development has been reported in the daily mail london evening standard and elsewhere could undermine the case for providing free nursery provision for unders it would be laughable if it wasnt so capable of causing damage he says capacity a new thinktank chaired by glass has called on ministers to build on the significant expansion in childcare provision since labour took power in by guaranteeing unders have hours of free care each week he says we know that highquality childcare can make a difference to childrens development especially children from deprived backgrounds and to the ability of mothers to integrate back into labour markets by improving confidence in themselves and it can make bringing up children less stressful so he welcomes chancellor gordon browns announcement in mondays spending review of a pilot scheme offering a free parttime early education place for twoyearolds in disadvantaged areas im a little bit surprised glass confesses but it seems to me an intelligent way of taking this forward as long as there is proper evaluation before making a decision about how it can proceed also unexpected but equally welcome was browns proposal to fund childrens centres by instead of the initial target of in each of the most disadvantaged wards in england the spending review followed the governments fiveyear education plan which offered more opportunities for parents to stay at home with unders if they want to and a wide range of accessible affordable highquality early learning and childcare for parents to choose from with payments according to means supported by tax credits there is no detail yet the government will say only that is exploring options for extending paid maternity leave to months glass favours extending maternity leave as long as it isnt a signal that childcare for young children is wicked he says the issue seems to be about choice im all in favour of parents who want to stay home but not all do you need to look at the mothers point of view glass himself is strongly against the presumption that mothers of one or twoyearolds should be going back to work last year he accused the government of being in danger of turning sure start into a new deal for toddlers in its drive to remove more mothers from poverty by getting them into employment but he certainly believes work should be an option for those who want it and it isnt if the provision is not available he points out whatever his personal view on the fraught debate about whether mothers of very young children should go back to work he always comes down firmly on the side of choice personally if i were a young mother i wouldnt put a child under one into allday daycare he says from what ive seen of the evidence about attachment in the first year it may not be the best solution but capacity advocates free childcare for unders because parents who want the option should have it im not recommending they should do it its a tricky decision best taken by parents there seems to be an industry devoted to making mothers feel guilty but it all depends on circumstances such as their relationship with their child and their income i dont see how there can be a universal recipe that everything would be all right if mothers stayed home all the time until kids went to secondary school his own children now both in their s went to nursery school from the age of three allowing his wife to resume her parttime teaching career glasss research outfit the national centre for social research which he joined from the treasury as chief executive in has conducted a number of surveys on parents use of and demand for childcare and early years services they demonstrated the need for more flexible free childcare for this reason he welcomes the governments proposal to allow the free hours of childcare a week for children aged three and four to be used more flexibly across the week than the daily sessions of twoandhalf hours currently available and to combine nursery education with childcare he is disappointed however that the childcare was not extended to hours a week as capacity recommended glass also supports the extension of the sure start approach of bringing together health early learning and parenting support for preschool children by expanding the numbers of childrens centres the centres may be created by developing existing nursery schools or sure start programmes of which there are the eventual aim is to have a childrens centre within easy reach of every parent but he is concerned that the m additional funding by that brown announced in the spending review to deliver the children centres amounts to a lot less per head than the m annual budget for sure start glass warns that it will be fantastically difficult if government expects a bigger contribution from local authorities and primary care trusts to fund the centres since that would mean agencies having to give up money from their priority areas such as child protection to pay for a preventive programme one of reasons for sure starts success in addition to parental involvement is that it was well funded with extra money it was perceived by other agencies as additional money so while they may have been competing for staff they were not competing over funding glass says he also has doubts about the ability of childrens trusts to bring together health social services and education from the statutory voluntary and private sectors to provide joint services for children and families in each local area glass when he was chair of his local sure start in croydon south london came up against powerful professional boundaries this experience together with his years in the civil service in various spending departments has left him sceptical about whether joint working will ever happen it depends what incentives there are for people to collaborate he says sure start meant that you would get extra money in your area if you worked together he believes that the development of an early years profession would help to break down boundaries being given the opportunity to create sure start as part of the chancellors child poverty agenda gave him a new lease of life he says it was an epiphany ive never recovered from it

the conservatives yesterday weighed into the increasingly militant campaign to increase rights for divorced fathers calling for a legal change to give parents equal access to children if they split up the tory leader michael howard said a new presumption of equal rights for parents over childrens upbringing was vital to ensure fathers in particular did not lose touch with their children after divorce there should also be a strong presumption that extended families should have a crucial role in bringing up children mr howard told the first conservative families summit speaking the day after the divorced fathers pressure group fathers justice disrupted a communion service at york minister to highlight the concerns of parents denied access to their children by the courts mr howard denied he approved of such tactics but he told bbc radio s womans hour that he had changed his mind over politicians role in ensuring parents had access suggesting that though he had previously thought courts had wide enough discretion he now felt there were too many examples where the law seems inadequate or powerless to intervene the newly appointed shadow minister for the family theresa may is to review the children act to examine how it is working in practice mr howard said that as the law stood parents with residence have found it far easier to obstruct the other parents access to their children and their ability to have a say on how their children are to be brought up when families break down both parents and families should have access to their children if that is at all possible the conservative leaders intervention comes as ministers are considering reforms to the system of dealing with disputes over access to children with leaked suggestions that mothers who flout court orders to allow fathers access could face tough punishments the childrens minister margaret hodge played down such rumours but told bbc radio s world at one that she was looking at ensuring

michael howard has come out in favour of greater legal rights for divorced fathers today at a conference called to discuss parenting following yesterdays disruption of the church of england synod in york by the protest group fathers justice and their attack on the prime minister in may the issue of child custody has shot up the political agenda according to leaks at the weekend the government is also considering issuing a green paper reforming the current law which gives automatic presumption to the mother in family court cases today mr howard said that the best parent is both parents and that the current situation is unfair and often fairly chaotic several countries including australia and new zealand have a law presuming shared parenting after divorces while critics including an anonymous government minister in the observer say the uk justice system has an inherent absolute gender bias the tory leader who recently created a post of minister for the family within his party said there should be a strong presumption in favour of equal rights for parents to have an influence on the upbringing of their children the absence of such a presumption has meant that parents with residence have found it far easier to obstruct the other parents access to their children and their ability to have a say in how those children are brought up we must redress that imbalance according to reports about current government thinking mothers who flout court orders on giving exhusbands access to their children could be forced to do community service one senior government source quoted in the observer said fathers had a very strong and i think very justified sense of grievance about the family courts the summit staged by mr howard discussed the idea of shared parenting where mothers and fathers get equal access rights a common practice in new zealand australia and the us at present judges are only allowed to impose fines or prison sentences on mothers who fail to allow fathers access to their children but imposing fines or even prison is seen as damaging to the family so are rarely used even when mothers flout court orders to allow access community service could now be introduced according to the sunday times ministers at a cabinet subcommittee meeting last week agreed to introduce a green paper outlining the changes to current law the paper reported according to

divorced fathers could split the custody of their children equally with their expartners under radical plans being pushed by senior ministers to tackle the growing anger of weekend dads who feel excluded from their childrens lives with fathers increasingly expected to take a handson role in raising their children senior figures are arguing it is unrealistic to expect them to walk away if their marriage breaks down one senior government source said fathers had a very strong and i think very justified sense of grievance about the family courts except in a minority of cases of abuse and violence it is in the childrens interests to have a lot of contact and involvement with their parents said the source i think where we ought to be going is much more towards the australian model or that of some american states where the norm is shared care shared parenting is routine in australia new zealand and parts of america with both parents having custody either for roughly equal amounts of time or depending on working hours at least greater access than many british fathers who are reduced to a few hours every other weekend the government has to tackle an absolute gender bias in the courts which says a childs place is with its mother the senior minister added the issue is fast becoming a political hot potato with tory leader michael howard due tomorrow to stage a summit showcasing the problems of parents caught up in custody battles the party is also looking at shared parenting plus draconian punishments for mothers who defy court arrangements for contact meanwhile bob geldof the rock star who has long campaigned for equal custody rights is interviewing politicians for a channel four documentary on the issue the sensitive debate over child custody has split the government delaying a blueprint for reform of child custody legislation meant to have been published last month by the department for constitutional affairs dca officials there are reluctant to be seen to give in to the militant mens movement whose activists threw purple flour bombs at the prime minister in the commons in may to highlight their cause however the power of the militant man vote at the ballot box has not gone unnoticed by either party we are sympathetic to the view that there are a number of parents not just dads but nonresident parents of both sexes who are excluded from contact with their children and that the current system is not able to deal with their problems said dominic grieve shadow spokesman on constitutional affairs who is coordinating the summit together with family affairs spokesman tim loughton grieve said he was sympathetic to calls for socalled shared parenting the summit will also discuss how to compel mothers to obey court orders for access in the us if the parent doesnt cooperate with the agreed plans they will just lose the child the child will be removed from that parents care said grieve it seems to work katharine rake director of pressure group the fawcett society warned however there was little firm evidence that courts were biased agianst men and that it would be unfair to insist on shared custody in marriages where childcare had never been shared before the reality of lots of contact disputes is not aggrieved fathers being deprived of access to their children its women bending over backwards to facilitate access and having to comfort upset children when their dads fail to turn up the tories appear to have backed away from an early flirtation with fathers for justice the militant group whose activists threw flour bombs at the prime minister although shadow cabinet minister tim yeo wrote to matt oconnor leader of the group and a constituent of his in april suggesting that i am confident we will be able to indicate our support for your campaign for changes in family law the publicity over the subsequent attack is thought to have scared the tories off grieve told the observer he would not deal with any organisation that had not disowned the flourbombers and fathers for justice is not expected to get a platform at the summit however howard has expressed sympathy with the equal parenting alliance which argues custody should be split equally wherever possible for instance with the nonresident parent able to spend up to days and nights with the child he will say tomorrow that the best parent is both parents even after divorce the government is drawing up a green paper on child contact arrangements expected to be published later in the summer dca sources say while the campaigns by moderate divorced fathers have moved the overall cause along the the key legal principle for the courts is that they should first consider the point of view of the childs best interests not those of warring

a tax credit scheme designed to help lowincome families afford childcare may be open to abuse by fraudsters it was claimed today the credit introduced by the chancellor gordon brown provides up to a week towards the childcare bills of more than parents in the uk but representatives of day nurseries and childminders today said they feared some of the money was going to the wrong people applicants for the childcare tax credit have to state the registration number of the care provider they are using but the number can easily be obtained by fraudsters because nurseries are required to quote it on every piece of literature they provide to clients one nursery manager told the bbc radio today programme she had been sent forms by the inland revenue relating to children whose parents were claiming the credit with her registration number only to find that many of them had never been to her centre i think it is very open to cheating she told the programme speaking on condition of anonymity i dont think it is really out in the public domain yet the amount of fraud other nurseries and childminders reported that parents had placed their children with them and said that they would pay their fees when their credit claim came through only to disappear weeks later after running up bills running into thousands of pounds gill haynes chief executive of the national childminding association said the inland revenue had pledged last year that it would check up on claims but few of her members had been contacted ms haynes told today having geared our members up to expect a call from the inland revenue they didnt come so we had lots of people in touch with us saying where is the inland revenue our members still have real concerns that there is misuse i think the big problem is we dont actually know how much of the money designed to go to childcare is actually getting there somebody and it is usually the childminders and childcare providers is picking up the bill when things go

madeleine bunting is right to draw attention to research that points up the difficulties of providing nursery care of sufficiently good quality to meet the needs of infants the preference of many parents not to return to work when their children are very small and the need for better provision of parental leave are nurseries bad for our kids g july but to suggest that nurseries might be bad for children is a sweeping assertion that misunderstands the many ways in which community and private nurseries preschools and other childcare provision serve the needs of families childcare is valued by parents not simply in order to work but as a means of providing social experiences for their children a period of respite for themselves a way of meeting other parents and an opportunity to get advice and help from earlyyears workers sure start programmes as the author acknowledges offer a range of activities to support parents and their children dropin facilities and workshops as well as child care and there is a compelling case for extending this type of approach more universally similarly the growth in private nurseries many of them offering very good provision draws attention away from a parallel growth in community nurseries where parents are involved in the management and daytoday operation of the nursery if a rethink is required then perhaps it should be to enter into dialogue with parents about what they actually want which is unlikely to be either a onesizefitsall model of full daycare or a return to pre when the care of children was seen to be a private matter whatever the family circumstances margaret lochrie director capacity of course the care parents give to young children is vital that is why this government has improved maternity rights and maternity pay and introduced paternity leave that is why we said in our fiveyear plan that we will explore options for extending support for mothers and fathers in the first year of a childs life but bunting is wrong to suggest that day nurseries are bad for children research tells us that poorquality daycare is bad for children goodquality daycare improves childrens life chances particularly poor children that is why i have been driving a programme to enhance the quality of childcare since we have been growing more quality childcare and free nursery education this gives parents particularly mothers real choice about whether to stay at home or go to work margaret hodge mp minister for children as experts in childcare research cited by madeleine bunting we want to make two points crystal clear this governments interest in a extending parental leave especially with pay b creating opportunities for parttime employment and c providing quality preschool education and care for children over

it is a striking fact that lone parent households contain a quarter of all children but account for nearly half of those in poverty as a result one and a half million of the countrys poorest children are today living on benefit in lone parent families where no one has a job since more lone parents have gone into work because of the new deal the minimum wage the working tax credit and other initiatives the lone parent rate of employment in the uk has increased to per cent but in the us lone parent employment is more than per cent in sweden above per cent and in france in excess of per cent our target is per cent lone parent employment by and let me explain the significance of this ambition if we meet our target to raise lone parent employment this one success alone could reduce the number of british children living in poverty by around and if we went even further to french levels we could reduce the number of children in poverty by a total of approaching half a million now research shows most lone parents would like to combine paid work with the vital job of being a parent but they face real barriers to doing so and those who work with lone parents and lone parents themselves have rightly called on us to do more to help them get the skills they need for work and to ease the transition between income support and paid work so while all lone parents are now invited in for workfocused interviews we are also piloting new lone parent work discovery weeks run by employers in london glasgow liverpool manchester leeds and birmingham that are providing introductory and preparatory courses for work in some of our best known retail stores hotels and companies and backed up by help with childcare where local employers identify a demand for skills lone parents in these six cities also have access to free nvq level training and funds to buy work clothes or equipment and because we recognise that the time of transition from benefits to employment can be difficult from october lone parents will benefit from a new job grant of when they move into work and they will enjoy a four week extension of housing benefit so what does the success of our recent measures mean in practise for tackling child poverty it means that with the new help with housing benefit lone parents on a typical rent of a week and working part time will receive at least a week for around hours work a week the effective hourly rate is not the minimum wage of but an hour making them far better off working part time than not working at all and so we have come to recognise that central to tackling child poverty as well as to the importance of helping families balance work and family life is the provision of adequate child care and while we have since created over a million more child care places the greatest help for low income families has been the third element of tax credits that we have introduced the tax credit for covering the costs of child care up to each week for families with one child in qualifying childcare and up to for those with two or more children when we started in it was claimed by just families it is now benefiting with maximum help given to lone parents and while we ensure that by nearly million children a year will have access to good quality childcare again for poor families the next stage in the extension of the child care tax credit is of greatest importance from april extended to a wider range of eligible childcare including in some cases at home and the tax credit will be supported by a new incentive for employers to give their employees up to a week free of income tax and national insurance to help with childcare costs public services so tax credits have been and will continue to be the key to tackling child poverty but as a government we also have a duty and role to play in encouraging the development of the potential of britains children through the provision of high quality public services and bruce katz has this morning shown why one of our priorities must be to drive up the performance of public services in our most deprived neighbourhoods and thus break long established cycles of deprivation and i do not underestimate the critical role that new investment in housing can play of all the services that contribute to the development of potential a good education the subject of the governments five year plan today is clearly the most fundamental so as i announced in the budget we are investing over years an additional billion in education raising average spending per pupil from the a year we inherited to by and as a sign of our commitment to tackling disadvantage by even more in the schools that benefit from our extra support for leadership and excellence to combat deprivation we have indeed a long way to go in ensuing for todays poor children a decent start in life but it is important to record that the greatest improvement so far in reading writing and maths has been in the primary schools of the poorest areas and i can tell you that the next stage is to help at an early stage the very pupils most in danger of falling behind and with extra money for their books and their classrooms equipment and staffing drive up their literacy and numeracy i can also inform you that secondary schools with more than per cent of their year olds eligible for free meals are now making the biggest gains in maths and science results at key stage indeed the number of secondary schools with less than per cent of their pupils achieving or more good gcses has fallen from over in to and todays five year plan sets out our next steps with the very pupils most in need offered more personalised learning including new vocational options and greater access to it i can tell you also that in the spending review there will be new more challenging floor targets for the poorest areas and as part of the review of the local formulae used to distribute schools funding due to take place later this year i would like to identify even more effective ways to target resources at tackling deprivation measures to help children in the bottom income quintile catch up particularly in primary school and measures to enable schools to meet the higher costs of educating children from poorer backgrounds who may have lower levels of early educational attainment and who may have far less parental support tragically britain has for decades had one of the poorest staying on rates of the industrialised world in britain more young people leave school early more leave without qualifications and more never reappear in the world of education so again to tackle both poverty and lack of opportunity and to seek to tackle perhaps an even greater challenge the poverty of aspiration amongst children and young people and their parents we have reformed the careers service introduced summer schools encouraged better links between schools and universities and colleges and we have piloted an education maintenance allowance up to a year on top of child benefit and the child tax credit for those young people who need financial help to stay on in education and get the qualifications they need and so successful has the allowance been in raising staying on rates that from september this year it will be available nation wide and as it goes nationwide be made available not just for school and further education courses but for training too once again helping all young people but doing more for those who need help most so that no child is left behind services for under fives i said at the outset that while we are committed to social security from the cradle to the grave too many children have already lost out within months of being born condemned to poverty because not enough has been done to help them from the cradle to the nursery school indeed for fifty years while there was undoubtedly much innovation in the voluntary and charitable sector welfare state support for the countrys youngest children consisted of maternity services vaccinations and a requirement to appear at school at age yet while the provision remained inadequate the evidence grew that the first four years of a childs life are critical to their personal development that children who went to nursery or other early education before they attended school were likely to have significantly improved social emotional and cognitive development that the longer children attend preschool and the higher the quality of the service the greater the positive influence and that such intervention was particularly beneficial for the poorest children and so it is clear that a strategy of counteracting disadvantage must begin right from the start of a childs life and that the earliest years once the lowest priority are now rightly becoming among the highest priority not just the biggest gap in provision and next frontier for us to cross but one of the single most important investments the welfare state can make the sure start maternity grant once just has been raised to a five fold rise in five years reversing a long standing policy that more child benefits went to older rather than younger children we doubled the child tax credit for the first year of a childs life to help parents stay at home with their children maternity leave and pay has been substantially extended and paternity pay now exists for the first time and earlier than planned nursery education is now available for all year olds as well as all four year olds now in the past to identify a problem the need to expand provision for infants from birth to three would probably have led simply to the creation of a new state service but i believe that what today is happening in the area of under five provision shows how what we do in the spirit of rowntree is based upon evidence how the best approach is multidimensional across the services and the range of provision mixed and how instead of a narrow focus on what central government can do voluntary and community organisations and parents and government local and national through not just one service but a range of services child health services social services and early learning are now all part of the solution i often say that sure start led by charles clarke david blunkett and margaret hodge is today one of the best kept secrets of government but it is also one of the unsung successes of the voluntary and community sector and there are now over sure start or childrens centres providing services for children across the country including a third of all children under four living in poverty and you have only to visit local sure start projects as i did in bristol a few weeks ago and then in birmingham last week to capture a very real sense of the difference they are making and already evidence from individual projects in some of britains most deprived areas shows that sure start is having a notable effect on childrens language development and social skills and on the interaction of parents and their children what is then exciting about sure start and the approach it represents i believe that what is exciting is what rowntree himself would have approved of and what rowntree foundation research has pointed towards first a coordinated approach to services for families with young children tackling the multidimensional causes of poverty physical intellectual emotional and social by adopting an integrated approach with childcare early education and play health services and family support at the core of sure start it reflects a growing recognition that housing health transport social services youth and many other services are vital in tackling child poverty and developing young peoples potential and the new public service agreements we will be publishing alongside our commitment to new investment for these services will reflect this second the emphasis within this approach on health and inequality highlighted by todays report of the health care commission and later this year there will be a new public health white paper refocusing our attention on preventive health which will emphasise once more the importance of tackling the unacceptable health inequalities including infant life chances which distort our country third sure start is emphasising the central role of parents in tackling child poverty and that is why parents are enlisted in the very running of the sure start projects we must never forget that it is parents who bring children up not governments and our emphasis is on the opportunities now available to parents and the responsibilities they must discharge so we are not only increasing the financial support available to parents and exploring options for future further increases in maternity and paternity pay but making available wider support for parents including expanding parenting classes and providing access to practical parenting advice in a wider range of locations fourth the central role of voluntary community and charitable organisations from mothers and toddlers groups to the playgroup and child care movement to vast and impressive range of specialist organisations throughout our country it is a humble recognition of the limits of government that child poverty cannot be removed by the action of government alone but by government working with parents voluntary charitable and community organisations and a celebration of the vital role of the voluntary and community sector in every city and town of our country and let us not forget that alongside traditional voluntary organisations like the churches and uniformed organisations for young people that have been declining in numbers there has been a mushrooming of young mothers groups playgroups and groups and clubs associated with children locally and nationally and let us be clear about the radicalism of our approach for sure start also enacts an important new principle into action that services for the underfives not only involve voluntary and charitable action at a local level even more so than we have done in the past but either in partnership or in sole control the very running of these local groups can be and is being passed to community control and it is a recognition that we must all accept our responsibilities as parents neighbours citizens and community leaders in the battle against child poverty and of course there is a fifth innovation the far greater emphasis on early learning so early that it can start with the local school contacting the mother not in the months before the childs fifth birthday but just a few weeks after the child is born backed up by innovations like bookstart offering children the books they might not otherwise have to start in their first months to learn to read and we can see now how combined with the improved income support for the under fives that i have described the additional cash resources for early learning and the support for the specialist groups many represented here that deal with disability special needs and other challenges a new more comprehensive approach not just to tackling child poverty but to developing the potential of every child is taking shape and as we approach the spending review next week and advance to the pre budget report i can tell you that what i have described this morning can only be the start of what we have yet to do building on sure start the next stage is to fund the creation of new childrens centres across the country again providing a combination of good quality childcare early years education family support and health services by children will be covered by sure start or childrens centres and there will be new funding despite our other representations to ensure childrens centres by one in each of the per cent most deprived wards in england as we advance towards our goal of a childrens centre for every community but sure start and related services point the way for a new agenda for services for young children greater encouragement for local initiatives and community action in the war against child poverty offering government money to back nongovernment initiatives to tackle disadvantage partnership with both the biggest voluntary and community organisations and the smallest the emphasis on prevention not simply coping with failure greater parental involvement in the running of services and anyone who like me has attended a sure start conference and seen the dynamism energy and determination of parents volunteers and carers in action can begin to understand the transformative power that organisations from the playgroup movement to the child care campaigns can have and i look forward to the little platoons in our communities becoming veritable armies demanding we do more so new finance like tax credits new initiatives like the new deal for lone parents new dimensions like support for child care new services like sure start new approaches whole services managed by the voluntary sector new directions engaging parents in the running of programmes all weapons in the war against child poverty all evidence that parents voluntary organisations and government can acting together make a real difference all evidence also that informed by knowledge working with the best of caring organisations public action can transform young lives go to a sure start programme as i did a few days ago and see the bright new investments that are starting to change the face of some of the most deprived areas of our country listen to a mother once feeling trapped in her home telling you how sure start has introduced her to other mothers with similar stories to tell hear the views of children of lone parents telling of their pride that their mother now has a job and hear the responses of parents on the child and working tax credits describing how what they can spend on their children has been raised by a week and so i tell you after seven years of government i am not less idealistic but more idealistic about what we can achieve working together because we now have evidence of what can be done by sure start in some areas of the country we want to apply the lessons to all parts of the country and because we have evidence of the good that is done for some children then we want to extend these opportunities to all children and what started for us seven years ago as an article of faith about what might be achieved is now a conviction based on clear evidence about what can and must be done because what has been done shows us what more can be done because the evidence of small successes shows what even larger successes are possible it must make us more even more ambitious to do more so my experience of government has not diminished my desire to tackle child poverty but made me more determined to do more for what has happened so far does not begin to speak to the limits of our aspirations for developing the potential of britains children but challenges us to learn from the changes now being made and strive in future years to do even more so on monday i will be able to announce the next stage in our policies for tackling child poverty and for helping the development of the potential of every child and i believe as a country we are ready to do more to tackle old injustices meet new needs and solve new challenges but what we can achieve depends upon the growth of a nationwide sentiment of opinion indeed a shared and concerted demand across communities across social classes across parties across all decent minded people that the eradication of child poverty is a cause that demands the priority the resources and the national attention it deserves it is not usual for government to welcome the growth of pressure groups that will lobby demonstrate embarrass expose and then push them to action but i welcome the new alliance for children the broad coalition of community organisations voluntary and charitable sector determined to push further to end child poverty for the emerging evidence and the growth in a nationwide public opinion emboldens me to believe it can indeed be this generation of campaigners charity workers child carers sure start organisers working together that will right the social wrongs that impelled joseph rowntree to action and ensure every child has a fair start in life so let us continue to follow the lead given by the pioneers who brought the rowntree foundation into being and inspired by a generation of reformers like rowntree who had a vision driven forward as the rowntree foundation has always been by the evidence of what is happening around us never loosing sight of the vision that inspiredradicalised a whole generation our eyes fixed firmly on the goal that if every child has the best start in life we can build a better britain,2004-07,striking fact lone parent household contain quarter child account nearly half poverty result one half million country poorest

fresh air and open fires how the danes do it the scene at the haven nursery in aarhus denmark epitomises denmarks reputation for innovative pioneering childcare a monthold crawls slowly down widespaced wooden steps while the childcare worker watches from a distance children aged from one to six years play in the sand and among the bushes which surround this large playground much of their time is spent outside and the emphasis on fresh air is very evident in the danish childcare system these toddlers take their afternoon nap in waterproof steel cots outdoors winter and summer in one corner of the playground is a hearth surrounded by big stones for open fires the children often bake bread there in another corner there are hens while another has vegetables growing the pedagogues as the staff are called might be talking quietly with a small group or working alongside a few children on the garden their role is not to dominate or organise the children their intervention is subtle gently ensuring the childrens welfare and play without being too intrusive inside the nursery there are few toys no computers and few displays the idea is that the children play more with each other and develop more imaginative games without toys denmark and sweden are frequently cited as the trump card in the nursery debate they have universal nursery provision from six months to six years and there have been no detrimental effects nurseries have huge popular support and are an established feature of every community runs the argument it is true that denmark has one of the highest maternal employment rates in the world and one of the highest birthrates among industrialised nations of all the developed countries denmark can probably lay claim to having solved the conundrum of women working and childrearing more than of children over the age of three are in fulltime childcare and more than of children under three the state heavily subsidises childcare and the staff are well paid and very well trained but look more closely at the danish system and it is not quite the trump proponents of nursery care claim it to be childcare starts late most mothers stay off work for the first year under generous paid parental leave plus twothirds of children under three in statesubsidised childcare are not in nurseries but looked after by childminders in their homes growing financial pressures on the system are evident too there have been staff cuts at the haven and the staffchildren ratios have dropped to shockingly low levels in the afternoons two adults are responsible for children aged from one to six recent research shows that the amount of time staff give to each child has dropped by in recent years despite some of the recent negative findings benedictas faith in the system is unshaken a mother of two sons she is currently unemployed but it never occurred to her to look after the children fulltime they are with their friends at home with me they would very quickly become bored its important for children to learn social skills and they learn that better in a neutral place than at home there are some in denmark who believe that the system might have deskilled parents and reduced their confidence in their own capacities but the faith in the childcare system to more than make good that deficit is still unshaken and given the high investment in the system and the strong ideals which underpin it its probably justified a generation ago parenting in denmark became a profession and a paid job westminster wobbles did the government get it wrong on nurseries a decade ago childcare barely featured on the political agenda now it is the subject of intense scrutiny in the treasury it has been widely leaked that investment in early years will be a central plank of the election manifesto but there is a fraught battle being played out over exactly what form the policy should take one of the faultlines is between nos favoured targeted approach which expands childcare and early years services in the poorest areas of the country and nos desire for a childcare policy which will ease the burden on middle england families as signalled by the recently announced consultation on an approval scheme for nannies and the possibility of extending tax credits currently only available to those on low incomes what has captured gordon browns imagination is that getting mothers into work is the most effective way to reach the government target on reducing child poverty plus nursery education is the most effective way to close the attainment gap already evident by months among toddlers in deprived communities these are the factors that have persuaded the chancellor to make a pledge of universal childcare but he has given no date for it the cost would be enormous childcare is a very expensive business sweden spends of its gdp on early years compared to the uks paltry this is the bit of the welfare state that was never built the vast bulk of the cost of childcare in this country is paid for out of parents taxed income the subsidy in the uk averages only compared to an average of in the rest of europe but as the treasury does the sums the research findings on the negative effects of group care for undertwos have begun to seep into the policy wrangles in the treasury and the department of education and skills des tony blairs recent proposal of extending nursery education to twoyearolds was not well received policymakers have become concerned about the possibility of a public backlash against the institutionalisation of underthrees what is known as the potsdam option of a universal state system of nurseries aka the danish is no longer regarded as a runner its very expensive and doesnt offer the kind of flexibility which many parents working on evening shifts or at the weekend need and it is likely to antagonise the childdevelopment experts anxious to preempt that kind of backlash the government is likely to make an extension of maternity leave from six months to a year the centrepiece of its announcement on early years in the dess fiveyear education plan today this reflects a significant shift in government thinking in the last couple of months to take on board what the research indicates say melhuish and belsky the policy thinking is now to look at alternatives to daycare such as boosting childminders and bringing forms of informal care such as grandmothers still the most popular form of nonparental childcare in the country within the scope of government support all of this marks a trimming of the sails of what has been until now the main thrust of government policy on childcare to bring affordable nursery provision to the poorest communities since new neighbourhood nurseries with startup grants have been opened daycare is now a required component of the new childrens centres they combine health education family support and employment advice which are to be opened in poor neighbourhoods by the tricky issue is that what is evident in many poor communities particularly among some ethnic minorities is that parents have a strong attachment to looking after their own children when they are very small the fear is that the original remit of sure start to support parenting is in danger of being overtaken by the agenda on childcare and getting mothers back to work there is an acute dilemma here as to whether the state should be persuading mothers of very small children to work it is one thing for middleclass professional mothers to enthusiastically return to wellpaid jobs but the advantages are a lot less clearcut if employment only slightly improves the mothers financial position after her contribution to childcare is taken into account while leaving her less time and energy to raise her children these dilemmas are clear to rachel layton the manager at the brandnew day nursery on the chapel street estate in brierley hill outside birmingham part of a new childrens centre it has the capacity to care for up to babies and toddlers at a time the piles of new toys are stacked in the corners waiting for them parents round here dont want to use day nurseries they dont want to leave their children with people they dont know this is their precious child and they dont want to hand them over to strangers were registered and inspected by ofsted and we have qualifications but they dont trust all that were attempting a big cultural shift on the other side of birmingham on another large housing estate chelmsley wood the mothers at the sure start project have very strong views on the subject as one of the first projects of its kind it runs the services parents asked for a dropin centre programmes to support parents encouraging them to read and sing nursery rhymes with their children but it has no daycare one of the mothers kate is planning to go back to work but only when her son is at school tom is my only child hes so precious im frightened and not sure about daycare it would worry me too much that he was spending too much time with other people another mother clare went back to work after three months with her first child that was eight years ago and this time around shes determined to do it differently i missed out on so much and i said i would never do that again i will wait until my children are in fulltime school rosemary murphy is the head of the national day nursery association which represents more than private nurseries yet even she is concerned that britain is stumbling into changes about how small children are cared for without anything like the kind of informed public debate necessary there is nothing more distressing than a young mother who has to go back to work and doesnt want to leave her child in a nursery that gives out signals to the child about how upset they are parents are in the middle they want the best for their child the mother always feels guilty and the last thing you want to do is put them through the fears that the childcare they have chosen will make their children antisocial we have to ask the questions as a society what do we want for our children by who should provide it theres a woeful lack of public debate we need to look at this whole question very carefully for two reasons firstly because it is fundamental to get child development right and secondly because we need to think about what childcare should look like are we developing the right kind of system this is not a debate which this government wants to lead or shape it has flinched from the huge financial commitment denmark made a generation ago it has adopted a policy of laissezfaire towards the vast majority of families leaving them to find their own solution to the childcare lottery and has thus presided over a spectacular growth in daynursery provision only now is it reluctantly beginning to acknowledge that the true cost of how we are revolutionising the care of babies and

parents should be entitled to free childcare for children under three to bring britain closer to the high levels of statefunded care found in other european countries according to a new childrens services thinktank launched today capacity whose board is chaired by norman glass a creator of the governments sure start programme argues that the government must provide much more support for families if it is to justify ambitious claims to regard childcare as a policy priority childcare and early years education will be highlighted in the governments fiveyear plan for education to be launched on thursday which is expected to include moves to expand the numbers of childrens centres and extend paid maternity leave by six months in a paper out today capacity says ministers must build on significant expansion in childcare provision since labour took power in by guaranteeing underthrees hours statefunded care each week the same total to which three and fouryearolds are currently entitled the free care available for three and fouryearolds meanwhile should be extended from to hours a week representing five full half days at nursery instead of the twoandahalf hour sessions

the policy agenda britain still lags far behind its european neighbours of western countries in a survey by the childcare trust the uk offered the lowest number of hours of free childcare if britain is to catch up capacity argues even the governments ambitious target of childrens centres one in each of the most deprived wards in the country should be doubled childrens centres are intended to bring together a range of childrens services ranging from childcare to health support to parenting advice on one site while they are widely supported the government has faced criticism for confining them to the poorest boroughs excluding high numbers of families living in poverty outside those areas margaret lochrie former chief executive of the preschool leaning alliance and a capacity director said the government needed to devote more spending to early years education and care despite the relative low profile of the issue in the minds of voters she said it is a difficult decision for a government to switch resources from the gold standard of university education or schools but that is the right thing to do if you really want to challenge social exclusion a mature childcare system along continental lines required a universal statefunded service she said the government today also faces criticism over childcare from the social market foundation thinktank which claims that the national childcare strategy is failing to deliver for many poor families priced out of costly early years care the current system of subsidising childcare via parents through the childcare tax credit

a guardianicm opinion poll showing that people are in favour of new measures to enable more familyfriendly working has prompted calls for the government to introduce further legislation labour mp martin oneill the chairman of the house of commons trade and industry select committee urged ministers to act on peoples rising expectations while striking a balance with the ability of small businesses to provide flexible working hours the guardianicm poll found that of people would like to see families being given a choice of deciding whether fathers or mothers should be able to take or share the six months paid leave currently available only as maternity leave fifty three per cent wanted to see fathers given more than the current two weeks paid maternity leave and want to see mothers given more than six months paid maternity leave speaking to guardian unlimited mr oneill praised the governments efforts to encourage greater worklife balance it recently gave employees the right to request flexible working hours betterpaid maternity leave and two weeks paid leave for fathers and called on it to act again people with young children want to spend more time with them and most reasonable employers would recognise that this would help improve employer relations he said however a sizeable minority of small and mediumsized enterprises often have difficulty in accommodating such arrangements the challenge for government is to strike the balance between these rising expectations and limited abilities mr oneill also confirmed that the commons trade and industry select committee is currently looking at ways to improve familyfriendly working legislation as part of its inquiry into flexible labour markets in the uk his view that the government needs to go further in encouraging worklife balance is shared by the liberal democrats trade and industry spokesman malcolm bruce and brendan barber the general secretary of the tuc mr bruce urged ministers to recognise that people who have children are making an economic contribution to the country and look at why so few parents are currently taking up their parentalleave entitlement he also called on the

the government abandon its optout of the european unions working time directive wtd which limits the number of hours employers can call on people to work he said that the findings of the guardianicm

a hidden social revolution in the publics attitudes towards the flexible working needs of parents with young children is uncovered in this months guardianicm opinion poll the survey shows that a fundamental shift has taken place in the attitudes of the new younger workforce towards the balance between work and family life from their parents generation the icm survey shows that there is strong sympathy among a clear majority of the public for young families trying to balance their responsibilities say they spend too much time at work the icm survey also shows that this social revolution has taken place rapidly with the governments reforms introduced into the workplace only in the last months the poll shows that a surprisingly large section of the public is familiar with the more family friendly package which gives employees the right to request flexible working hours and offers better paid maternity leave and two weeks paid paternity leave for fathers it shows that the changes have proved popular with saying the government has got it about right and indeed there is a fairly strong appetite for ministers to go further with saying the changes so far are too mean the thirst for further reform is strongest among those in their s and s and weakest among the overs when asked what the governments priorities for further change should be they overwhelmingly opted to give new fathers a chance to take a greater role in bringing up their children tony blair has already said he wants to extend the more family friendly work hours to those caring for elderly relatives the poll shows that would like to see families being given a scandinavian style choice of deciding whether mothers or fathers should be able to take or share the six months paid leave currently available only as maternity leave this option was followed by wanting to see fathers given more than the current two weeks paid paternity leave followed by who want to see mothers given more than six months paid maternity leave these results add up to more than because those surveyed were able to select more than one option the change in social attitudes is underpinned by the result to a separate icm question showing that there is majority support to end britains optout of the eu working time directive and so introduce a maximum hour working week but while the guardian poll uncovers support for more flexible working for those with family responsibilities it also shows there is a danger that further reform could provoke a political backlash a significant minority say that the additional workload on other staff generated by time off for new parents is unfair the poll results show that only of the public believe that parents with young children have got their current workfamily life balance right with agreeing they spend too long at work slightly more women than men believe new parents spend too much time at work awareness among women is also higher than among men of recent changes in maternity and paternity leave and new rights to request flexible working changes introduced last year include maternity leave of up to a year with the first six weeks paid at of annual salary and the next weeks at a week with the rest unpaid fathers get two weeks paid paternity leave at a week this was about right according to but one in five men thought the changes were too generous as did a third of those aged over while of men and of to yearolds thought they were too mean labour voters were the most supportive of work pattern changes with conservatives the least enthusiastic this was most marked on giving fathers a greater role in parenting around of labour and liberal democrat voters endorsed this idea compared with only of tory voters icm interviewed a random sample of adults

introspection is not a quality associated with enterprise so when the equal opportunities commission eoc asked employers how they rated their support for employees during pregnancy and the subsequent return to work virtually all awarded themselves excellent marks further questioning however revealed that more than a quarter were unable to name a single statutory maternity benefit the remainder fared better on maternity leave and maternity pay awareness of other benefits such as time off for antenatal classes was lower and of employers agreed with the statement it is not worth offering training to a pregnant woman because she might leave it is illegal to refuse training on the grounds of pregnancy the eoc research which has yet to be fully written up also indicates that some kinds of enterprise are more likely to be aware of maternity benefits than others unsurprisingly large employers with predominantly female workforces are most likely to be up to speed small businesses especially those which employ more men then women are least likely the adverse effects of legislation on small businesses are often cited by those opposed to statutory benefits this is unfortunate because it creates the idea in the public mind that small businesses are pettyminded handtomouth operations small businesses which are often dedicated to doing technically complicated things are at the forefront of sponsoring students through university are the backbone of the modern apprenticeships scheme enjoy much better employee retention rates than corporations and make far fewer redundancies nevertheless it is true that small businesses seldom employ anyone with human resources expertise and do not always keep up to date with employment law to remedy this the charity working families has set up a web page specifically for small businesses which provides simple checklists of employers responsibilities not only with regards to maternity rights but also the new obligations

one in four employers do not believe it is worth spending money on training a pregnant worker even though refusing to train an employee because she is pregnant is against the law according to a new survey published today most firms have a positive attitude to pregnancy in the workplace and said they supported female staff who became pregnant but the poll of employers by the equal opportunities commission eoc also showed that did not believe it was worth training someone who was pregnant a similar number could not cite any of the statutory entitlements covering pregnancy such as maternity leave or time off to attend antenatal appointments managers said the most difficult issues to manage centred on whether a woman would return to work and on planning cover during maternity leave jenny watson deputy chairwoman of the eoc said many organisations do handle pregnancy positively and as a result see business benefits such as better retention rates and increased productivity yet the results of our new research suggest that significant numbers of employers have limited knowledge of the law which may be preventing them from managing pregnancy effectively practical issues such as arranging maternity cover can also present problems for employers who want to treat pregnant employees fairly but both large and small employers have told us that these practical difficulties can be overcome or at least minimised through good planning and dialogue said ms watson the survey was conducted as part of the eocs investigation into pregnancy discrimination in the workplace dianah worman diversity adviser at the chartered institute of personnel and development said after well over a quarter of a century of legislation to protect women from discrimination and new legislation in the s to protect pregnant workers these figures show how deepseated discrimination is and how difficult it is to overcome in a tight labour market employers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain suitably skilled staff training is recognised as one way you can hang on to people who might otherwise leave employers choosing not to train loyal and experienced staff because they are pregnant risk losing them to competitors not offering training to pregnant staff is bad business it could reduce the commitment of staff to the organisation mean you get less from your people lower retention rates and make it more difficult to recruit replacements for the people you drive away a spokesman for the department of trade and industry said this research shows that most good employers are committed to giving pregnant employees a fair deal at work we welcome the eocs consultation and look forward to their final report,2004-08,one four employer believe worth spending money training

more than a quarter of companies oppose training pregnant members of staff because they think it is a waste of money even though it is against the law according to the results of a survey published today the same percentage were also unable to cite any statutory entitlements for pregnant staff such as maternity leave to time off allowed to attend antenatal clinics the survey carried out by the equal opportunities commission eoc as part of its investigation into pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was based on a poll of employers the majority of firms had a positive attitude to pregnancy in the workplace and offered support to their female staff but they said there were issues around maternity cover and whether a woman would return to work after pregnancy jenny watson deputy chairwoman of the eoc said many organisations do handle pregnancy positively and as a result see business benefits such as better retention rates and increased productivity yet the results of our new

cover can also present problems for employers who want to treat pregnant employees fairly but both large and small employers have told us that these practical difficulties can be overcome or at least minimised through good planning and dialogue she said belinda phipps chief executive of the parent support group the national childbirth trust said these figures sadden me but i am not surprised some companies seem to think that having a baby is the end of a persons working life but when you look at a womans life which may span years having a baby accounts for maybe six months on maternity leave and two years with a dependent child she said the last thing that pregnant women want who are already facing adjustments in their life is to start worrying about what is happening at work when you are having a baby you dont want to have to worry about your job as well the confederation of british industry cbi said the majority of companies supported pregnant staff and were aware of their statutory obligations but a spokesman said for the smaller firms which dont have large human resources departments it is important that the laws which apply to pregnant women are simple and easy to understand i

working mothers are to be offered emergency childcare if a childminder goes sick or a child cannot go to nursery under plans being drawn up in downing street stateregistered agencies would be used to provide a lastminute service saving women from the dilemma of whether to take time off or call in sick when normal childcare arrangements collapse they could also help mothers with childcare during school holidays until now emergency childcare has largely been the preserve of wellpaid city mothers who are offered backup nanny services by their employers to ensure they stay at their desks wall street firms introduced the idea in the late eighties and now banks in the city such as jp morgan chase and ubs routinely supply emergency childcare as part of lifestyle concierge services a handful of private agencies offers backup care direct to parents but they often specialise in nannies and their rates can be high the governments plan would involve private agencies but would also use stateregistered and vetted carers that would open the door to poorer families who could use the childcare tax credit they receive from government to help to cover the bill this has to be part of the package in the sense that when your regular childcare arrangement breaks down who do you have to step in said stephen burke of the daycare trust the national childcare charity agencies basically enable the parent to carry on working safe in the knowledge that their child is being well looked after the idea of statesubsidised emergency childcare came from backbench women mps who have been consulted by downing street aides seeking ideas for the next election manifesto it follows calls last week from julie mellor head of the equal opportunities commission for a national childcare system as reliable as the nhs which would fill in the gaps between the patchwork of arrangements many harassed working mothers have set up for themselves emergency childcare services could also help the per cent of parents who work shifts and therefore sometimes want care at unusual times and provide cover for longer spells such as during school holidays when nurseries often close the daycare trust is pushing for an expansion of sitter services already offered in scotland which in an emergency will either send a carer to the parents home if the usual minder falls through or a nurse if the child cannot go to nursery because he or she is sick with a minor ailment the department for education and skills is currently consulting on a new system of light touch vetting and approval for childcare workers which could make it easier to set up sitter services and emergency childcare agencies ministers have already signalled that they plan to include nannies under the scheme meaning the childcare tax credit will finally cover nannies as well as nurseries and childminders the credit can only be used for stateapproved carers the changes could be introduced as early as april just in time for the

new evidence of the glass ceiling faced by women working in academia shows that while there has been a rise in the number employed by universities their jobs tend to be more casualised and junior than those of their male colleagues a report published by the association of university teachers aut shows that the number of female academics employed in british higher education soared to between and in the same period the number of male academics edged up just to women now comprise almost of the total workforce but overall they tend to be involved in teaching and learning rather than research and are also more involved in pastoral care the report the unequal academy shows that the use of casualised fixedterm contracts is higher for women than for men in of all female academics were employed on such contracts compared with of men the aut research shows that the glass ceiling continues to pervade university working life in almost all cases the proportion of women on a particular academic grade fell as it became more senior in post universities the former polytechnics of academics on the lecturer grade are women but only of heads of department are women in older universities of the most junior lecturers are women compared with of professors the report also shows that of female academics now work on a parttime basis against of men while women working fulltime earn of the salary of their male colleagues on average at the same time male academics engaged in both teaching and research are now times more likely than their female colleagues to be counted as research active in the research assessment exercise a key factor in influencing promotion opportunities sally hunt general secretary of the aut said this report provides yet more evidence of the discrimination faced by women working in our universities they are paid less are more likely to be employed on a casual basis and continue to occupy the more junior grades it is time for our universities to take some real action to solve this scandal employers have expressed concern about the situation lady warwick chief executive of universities uk an umbrella group said in a speech earlier this year that the sector could be plunged into crisis unless more young women were given more encouragement to aim for top jobs in academia family responsibilities have been cited as an issue for women who may be held back because of the long hours culture as well as the need to publish research attend conferences and network with colleagues across britain and abroad a spokeswoman for the universities equality challenge

the new frontier of the welfare state continues to be extended it is as charles clarke said yesterday as bold and ambitious as the creation of the national health service itself progress towards providing universal affordable and flexible childcare for the parents of all three to yearolds from am to pm has already made important strides seven years ago there were no sure start schemes and no childcare strategy in the first neighbourhood nursery opened now there are with places sure start schemes are up and running outofschool clubs half on school premises extra childcare places plus parttime nursery education for all three and fouryearolds whose parents want it seven years ago there was only one childcare place for every nine children under eight now there are four the government was already committed to providing childrens centres in the poorest communities by now it has pledged there will be a childrens centre in every community by the end of its third term though it still has to define community add in the new pledge for paid maternitypaternity leave for parents for the first year of the childs life and it is easy to see why social historians will mark this early years provision as a major social revolution it will not be a smooth road ahead the national audit office wants a more sustained funding stream previous years were bedevilled by a multiple number of shortterm streams which led to one childcare place closing for every two opening no new finance was announced this week but schools cannot open from am to pm without extra funding the current costsharing of childcare central government bn local government bn parents bn is lopsided and needs more public investment the day care trust has rightly emphasised the need for better training and

supporters foxhunting ask us to appreciate the traditional picture of the hunt in full cry but there seems to be an almost equal number of people who see red both literally and otherwise i cannot myself get very worked up either way if only i could feel a similar kind of indifference towards the rambling fraternity who were out in force last weekend following the implementation of the governments new right to roam policy but there was not much sign of any roaming or even rambling in the resulting scenes instead the spirit of the organised route march prevailed walking in the country ought to be a solitary occupation giving rise perhaps to thoughts of the poet wordsworth who wandered lonely as a cloud but there is nothing in the least romantic about the parties of ramblers that i see regularly in my neck of the woods all of them uniformly dressed in anoraks and bobble hats some with ordnance survey maps hung round their necks in little canvas containers whatever they are doing it is not roaming their route has been worked out in advance and come what may they are going to stick with it so it is welcome to mr blairs newlook new labour countryside out go the men in red coats in come the men in bobble hats i cant think of it as an improvement hewitts howler the labour party in the person of patricia hewitt will be busy in the coming week talking about familyfriendly policies but what does these actually involve apparently the idea is to extend maternity and paternity leave thus allowing mothers and fathers to spend a bit more time with their newborn babies before returning to work not surprisingly the proposals have alarmed many small firms especially those which employ large numbers of young women however that may be it is difficult to see anything very familyfriendly about the hewitt plan what she is really concerned about is making it easier especially for women to go on earning while at the same time bringing up small children the proposals coincide with new policies aimed to provide for childminders and nursery schools to look after the children of socalled working mothers if patricia hewitt and her colleagues were really interested in family they might start thinking about ways to enable mothers not to go back to work but to stay at home and look after their children which is what family life is all about that might cost the state money but it would be nothing compared to the huge sums which currently flow in one way or another from the soaring rate of divorce and the consequent breakup of families enfeebled blair we are all supposed to think well of mr blair for standing firm in the face of terrorists demands for the release of female prisoners in iraqi jails no one likes to point out that blair has little or no say in the matter the reason he is not doing anything in this crisis has nothing to do with any firm stand on a matter of principle he is not doing anything because there is absolutely nothing that he can do he could i suppose ring up his allegedly close friend george w bush and ask for his help but he would almost certainly get the brushoff bush did nothing to help the two american engineers who were beheaded by the terrorists why should he do anything for their british colleague all along blair has tried to make out that by being the close ally of the united states he has been able to exercise influence and to gain concessions but there is nothing much to show for it blair has acted as a figleaf for bush and thats about all some people may remember that just before the invasion of iraq the prime minister proudly announced that in return for british support bush had agreed to pursue a settlement of the middle east conflict the socalled road map but as soon as the invasion was over bush unilaterally gave his support to ariel sharon for building more jewish settlements in the west bank sharon went on building his wall and demolishing the palestinians houses and the road map was thrown into the bin and blair had absolutely no say in that matter either,2004-09,supporter foxhunting ask u appreciate traditional picture hunt full cry seems almost equal number

early this summer there was gloomy news from the pollsters women had fallen out of love with the government the young were angry about the war the elderly wanted pensions to match those of their husbands the middleaged felt disillusioned on several scores health education their personal trust in the prime minister the research carried out by mori and the fawcett society made sober reading for the government not just because women make up the majority of the electorate butbecause the labour party might reasonably have assumed it had the womens vote nailed in the first place didnt tony blair come to power with a record women mps didnt he create a minister for women yet here we are on the eve of another labour party conference with not more but fewer labour women mps than in and only one of the five women in blairs original cabinet remaining margaret beckett clare short mo mowlam estelle morris and harriet harman have all served as cabinet ministers in the past seven years all have resigned been sacked or stood down the women who wont be voting labour in the next election say they are deeply sceptical of blairs ability to make positive changes in their lives and they are less optimistic than men about the future of the health service and the economy many of these women secured blairs landslide in so how might labour entice back the women who have fallen out of love with it we decided to put together a manifesto for the general election a mission statement of those issues the next labour government because right now no one else shows any sign of getting in needs to prioritise to address the concerns of women of course many male voters are disaffected too and for some of the same reasons so why a womens manifesto and not a mens because men are not underpaid and underrepresented to anything like the same extent and because all the research shows that real equality is something most men want too equal pay equal representation an equal share in parenting what do you put in a womens manifesto the issues about which women have particular concerns range from the availability of breast cancer screening to the difficulty of getting prams on public transport from the criminalisation of prostitutes to whether extended paternity leave just means more time down the pub nor are they simply womens issues a more equal society is one that benefits all of its citizens of course these proposals do not cover everything not by a long chalk but we wanted to be realistic to focus on those things that would make a real difference to womens lives and that were eminently achievable all of this will cost but labour could start raising the money through a fairer system of taxation a hike of on people earning more than this government has made important steps in the right direction on several of these issues on monday the minister for women patricia hewitt said she hoped to put improved parental leave and greater rights to flexible working at the centre of a radical policyrich manifesto that would be a great start but here are a few other things that need to be there too,2004-09,early summer wa gloomy news pollster woman fallen love government young

the headline writers were excited females heading departments earn more than males said the latest report from the chartered management institute for the first time women heading corporate departments earned more than men good grief but whats the catch they are special only a quarter of department heads are women there are more women managers than five years ago but women still make up only one in seven of company directors there are very few on the boards of top ftse companies and no woman in the greedy stratosphere of those earning sevenfigure salaries does any of that matter not a lot but it is symbolic that the cards are stacked against even these highest flyers however the serious pay battle has never been about welloff women the most oft quoted fact about inequality and the pay gap is that on average women working fulltime get less than men but that does not begin to reflect the true status of women the most shocking fact is that of all working women are earning less than an hour half of all women in fulltime jobs and of those in parttime work are earning well below the council of europes decency threshold of an hour for most of the women who have flooded back into the labour market in the past years work is not a sign of liberation but of abject drudgery for subsurvivable wages low pay and womens inequality are one and the same phenomenon solve one and you solve the other when labour extols the wonders of britains flexible market it means lowpaid women in jobs without prospects working flexible hours so they can do most of the childcare and housework at the same time as one or maybe two jobs that dont pay the bills tax credits subsidise their employers to pay wages that no one can live on cleaning caring catering and cash registers the four cs are what occupy most working women but because these are traditionally womens jobs they are undervalued and underpaid when the equal pay act came in years ago the hope was that women would quickly move into higher paid mens work but job segregation is as rigid as ever women have not become wellpaid bricklayers plasterers or plumbers and are unlikely to in the foreseeable future the only way they can earn equal pay is through society revaluing the work they do the skills of the carer in the old peoples home the hospital cleaner the nursery nurse and the classroom assistant are tasks as vital as any equal pay for work of equal value has to be brought in the system for fair comparison is there but mostly unused womens pensions are a critical issue the great majority of poor pensioners are women who have taken time out to care and who have been earning low wages they are excluded from entitlement because they have earned too little they need better fairer credits towards their pensions so they end up with equal rights summary every employer to carry out an equal pay review every few years government to force every state employer and contractor to conduct and act on pay reviews immediately a pensions system that does not penalise women for caring and which recognises different working patterns everyones pay should be published without unions in most workplaces employers get away with secretive and unjust pay structures openness is the only guarantee of fairness the minimum wage to be increased to come into line with the european decency threshold of an hour an increase in the carers allowance to at least the same level as the basic state pension in july the government promised the unions to end the twotier workforce whereby those employed by contractors eg cleaners in hospitals are paid less than direct state employees affecting mainly lowpaid women this needs to be implemented at once not phased in every employer should be obliged to allow unions in once a year to talk to the

few like to look at them but the statistics on rape convictions are unbearably bleak reported rape has trebled in the past decade less than of reported rapes result in a conviction less than of rapes are reported to the police there is more rape and it is easier to get away with the law itself is not to blame mp vera baird was the driver behind the sexual offences act which came into force in may a man may no longer claim that he believed a woman was consenting to sex a jury must instead be convinced that his belief was reasonable this change could have a big impact with more pleas of guilty at an early stage and the message sent out that the smug but i thought she wanted it mlud defence is no longer enough but the act must be closely monitored if it is to have any effect at all because it is in the hands of judges lawyers and juries our judiciary not renowned for its regiment of women there are among of the most senior judges needs to be evaluated carefully to check that it interprets the new law properly how did judge michael roach let off trainee croupier michael barrett with a conditional discharge for having sex with a yearold girl with the comment i trust you to behave yourself now do judges have a clue about the reality of todays social culture of contemporary gender relations as for the police we need sexual assault referral centres sarcs in each of the police forces where victims have access to women doctors counsellors and specialist nonuniformed officers there is evidence that specialist treatment by the police is more likely to end in a conviction and yet there are only eight sarcs in the whole of england and wales we also need public funding for rape crisis centres which are aimed at more longterm psychological support three have closed in the past three months demonstrating the low priority our culture gives to the victims of sexual abuse and finally the public it is jurors who acquit presentable young men who look just like their sons it is jurors who assume that women in short skirts are asking for it so what is needed is a highprofile hardhitting public information campaign debunking the myths about rape just as aggressive public information broadcasts changed the way the public sees drinkdriving which was absolutely acceptable years ago so outdated thinking on sexual violence must be highlighted and quashed for example a lowcut top does not excuse rape nor does bleached hair or being drunk rape is rarely committed by strangers former strangerrapists understand the courts well enough to know that if they get to know a woman before they rape her then they will probably get away with it the overwhelming majority of rapists are friends boyfriends husbands exlovers men in bars summary tight monitoring of

sixty years ago the women of blackburn constituency labour party rebelled demanding that at least one woman should be on the shortlist of candidates they got their way and in due course got barbara castle for an mp blackburn was not the only constituency where women who had grown accustomed to exercising authority during the war years influenced candidate selection labours first landslide in saw women mps victorious all but three of them labour but by there were fewer women mps than in it wasnt until the next labour landslide in that more than women were elected only for the total to fall again in such a pattern of underrepresentation demands correction by intervention experience in wales where there is a gender split in the assembly scotland and the european parliament all show that positive action such as allwomen shortlists and twinning works research repeatedly confirms that women especially young women feel a parliament that looks so unlike their own lives cannot represent them but women in parliament also bring diversity to debate and decisionmaking the current generation of women in government communicate in a less adversarial way a different view of politics from their male colleagues their perspective can make them less awed by traditional lobbies and quicker to see perhaps unintended implications of policy decisions on women and families following such hype and promise the last election was a gloomy moment after the government refused to reintroduce the legally suspect allwomen shortlists that had made such a contribution in the number of women mps fell for the first time since the embarrassment persuaded the government to amend the sex discrimination act to allow positive discrimination in the selection of political candidates until a sunset clause comes into effect in since the start of the party has operated with a strong presumption that mps who retire will be replaced by a candidate from an allwomen shortlist if labours share of the vote holds up after the next election there should be a new record number of women mps but they will still be predominantly labour the liberal democrats and especially the conservatives choke on the idea of direct intervention and this government insists it would be wrong to impose it on them both parties have increased the number of women candidates although not necessarily in winnable seats but they are a long way from the culture shift that will broaden their parties gene pool at the current rate of progress it will be years before the tory party has full gender equality summary all political

childcare should be the key issue of the manifesto gordon brown has already articulated the dream of a childrens centre in every community which combines health earlyyears care and education up to the age of six what we want now are dates for how and when this will be rolled out across the country the big leap is to move from the existing childcare policies targeted at the most disadvantaged wards in the country to services that are truly universal this government has hugely expanded the provision of childcare since but there is still only one place for every four children the aim should be a place for every child over two by the end of the next parliamentary term the challenge for the government is to ensure that the key characteristics of this expansion are affordability quality and choice several of the schemes the government has put in place to help families have created a childcare lottery with many families still finding the costs exorbitant particularly if they live in london and the southeast or have more than one child for starters the childcare element of the working tax credit must be improved at present it has a ceiling of per week for one child and a maximum of for two children yet the true cost of care is as much as for one child alone if there is more than one child the family is left with a hefty childcare bill in addition the childcare tax credit currently has a cutoff point of if you earn above that you are not eligible every parent should have a range of choices to ensure they can find something suitable for their working hours and their child that means extending the home carers scheme launched in april so that the large amount of informal care currently done by grandparents still the most widely used form of nonparental care in the uk can come within the scope of government support and thus be eligible for the childcare tax credit at the other end of the spectrum nannies are exorbitantly expensive because employers are responsible for their tax and national insurance too often employers take short cuts such as paying cash in hand to the detriment of the nannys pension entitlement a nanny is not always a luxury option but can be a final resort for parents with atypical working hours or a child with special needs who find that nurseries and childminders cannot help why should a chauffeur be taxdeductible but not a nanny more than of nurseries are run by privatesector companies they often operate on very tight margins pay their staff badly and frequently end up having to close it is a system run on a knifeedge there should be a far bigger nonprofit sector of community and voluntary organisation nurseries with reliable longterm funding one of the most pressing issues is that those working in nurseries are badly paid and the turnover rate in the job is more than as childcare provision continues to expand a shortage of suitable staff is likely to be a major constraint an immediate task is to improve the workforce they need better pay and better training in short childcare needs to be a new profession with real status summary a childrens centre in every community and a childcare place

imagine a new family mother father and baby the parents pledged one another in the innocent days of pregnancy to care for their child equally as the day draws nearer they decide to take all the time away from work that they can for the mother that means up to a year away from work the first six weeks paid at of her earnings the next weeks at the next six months unpaid the father who has been employed for exactly the same amount of time finds he is allowed just two weeks away from work rewarded at the standard rate of after those two weeks for hours a day the mother is alone with the child for those hours the father is back in the rhythm of work the parents feel the clash in their priorities and sometimes feel as if they are speaking across a great rift she begins to say he tries but he just cant get work out of his head he begins to think i try but ill never be as good as she is at under standing what is needed at home from the very beginning the father is considered marginal to his babys life and so is pushed back to work quickly in turn making him more marginal equalising rights to leave will not revolutionise our society overnight but it will go some way towards changing this selfperpetuating pattern of inequality if parents were entitled to a long block of shared paid leave they could negotiate something more equal between themselves she might take four months off then he might take four months and then she might take another four months or they might both take six months of leave as halfweeks so that together for a year they jobshared this is something that fathers should be campaigning for too since the current system of leave locks a father out at a time when new relationships are being made and new priorities decided on monday womens minister the patricia hewitt said that the government was looking at introducing a years paid leave in which the last six months could be transferred to the father but since these last six months would be paid at the standard allowance of few fathers will take it up governments cannot reforge the experiences of domestic life but government can at least make the landscape in which we operate more level the current system of maternity and paternity leave is an iron barrier to the movement towards equality and it is time that the government dismantled it and built a gateway instead summary more paid leave to be shared between parents as they wished this could be job shared eg each parent taking halfweeks for six months leave paid at a rate in line with best practice in other european countries a higher rate

a manager for the giorgio armani group who was sacked after taking two periods of maternity leave two years apart has won nearly in compensation for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination the employment appeal tribunal ruled that sarah vince cain did not have to mitigate her losses by taking another job but was entitled to go into higher education instead when she was unable to find a job at the same seniority which was flexible enough to accommodate her childcare needs mrs vincecain from leeds earned plus a bonus as a regional manager for the armani group she initially took maternity leave from december to march and for her second pregnancy from christmas to the end of april she was marginalised after each leave and sacked in october her solicitor gary tobin of the law firm

her search for alternative employment to a job at a similar level with the same degree of flexibility if such a search is not fruitful this individual may opt for a completely different career path to accommodate the job flexibility that she requires mrs vincecain now in the third year of a bsc course in dietetics at leeds metropolitan university said she was delighted and felt thoroughly vindicated she added i understand that my former employers have taken this judgment to the court of appeal i am very disappointed a spokesman for cloisters the chambers of the two barristers who

have been met with alarm from employers groups new fathers could see their statutory paternity pay in the two weeks after the birth of their child increased from around a week to of their salary and mothers could enjoy maternity pay for the full first year of their childs life at present they are entitled to six months paid leave at of salary for the first few weeks then a week for the remainder and six months unpaid ms hewitts proposal would extend the weekly payment for the rest of the year and it would also be payable to fathers so that they could spend time with their children while the mother goes back to work ms hewitt told the financial times i have no doubt at all that a centrepiece of the manifesto will be a package of support for hardworking families and we will be campaigning on that as a big part of the election in a pamphlet for the institute for public policy research setting out her ideas ms hewitt accepted that labours second term had lacked the same strength as its first four years in power and called for a radical policyrich manifesto the prime minister tony blair made clear in his speech to the tuc last week that the worklife balance would be a key policy area for the third term he hopes labour can win an aide to ms hewitt stressed that her proposals were not yet party policy any changes to parents rights at work would come after and following extensive consultation with unions employers and other affected parties he said susan anderson director of human resources policy at the confederation of british industry told the bbc its all very well to say we want more and more familyfriendly rights but if we dont consider the impact on the employer then there arent going to be jobs for them to go back to there will be costs not just because of the costs of the pay itself but the costs of employing temporary workers and the uncertainty that arises when you dont know whether somebodys going to come back after six months or a year nick goulding chief executive of the forum of private business said smaller employers will be worried about bearing a disproportionate burden from these proposals and will view them with a sense of dread although the government is saying it will meet the costs business will be highly sceptical of how these proposals will be funded in the long term the tuc general secretary brendan barber said patricia hewitt has put the policies agreed at labours policy forum at warwick into a compelling case for a new and radical focus on the workplace in a third labour term employers may complain but this is a compendium of votewinners fathers direct the national information centre on fatherhood today welcomed ms hewitts proposals but expressed disappointment that she had stopped short of advocating the socalled daddy month four weeks paid paternity leave taken flexibly in the early years of a childs life director duncan fisher said we warmly welcome patricia hewitts support for increasing the level of statutory paid paternity leave currently it is too low so many families cannot afford to take it however we had hoped that she would also support introduction of the daddy month which has been so clearly successful in increasing the longterm role that fathers play in their childrens lives we hope that ms hewitt will revise her proposals given the weight of research showing that the children of involved fathers do better at examinations are less likely to get into trouble with the police and enjoy longterm mental health benefits,2004-09,union parent group today welcomed labour proposal new

the glass ceiling in the workplace has cracked and may be about to shatter as women gain a bigger share of wellpaid senior jobs a survey claims today the chartered management institutes survey of managers found for the first time that women heading corporate departments earn more than their male counterparts they average men get less women are not yet in a majority at this level but the proportion has increased from less than a fifth in to more than a quarter this year at every tier of management except at the top of the largest corporations women have made huge inroads over the past five years the number of women directors has increased from less than one in to one in seven women make up of team leaders compared with in taking the makeup of british management as a whole are women compared with in and less than when the annual survey began years ago the institute concluded the glass ceiling is giving way for the women managers themselves there were signs of quiet satisfaction that they are starting to achieve the strength of numbers in their organisations that is needed to changing the workplace culture johanna severinsson european marketing director for the internet security company websense was the only woman manager when she joined four years ago now three of the eight managers in the european division are women and the difference is beginning to show every company becomes more healthy when it gets a mix of gender culture and ages she said it may have helped me at first to be the only woman i stood out that can work if you are strong enough to cope with the challenges in a maledominated area but it helps the company to be more successful if its management contains different points of view eight months pregnant she said it was invaluable to have a woman human resources director with whom she can openly discuss work pressures petra cook the institutes head of policy said the first breakthrough came a couple of decades ago when the first women got into management now we have broken the barriers and achieved a critical mass this is changing the organisations in general a female management culture is more participatory consultative and empowering women are challenging the oldstyle organisations that are bureaucratic and autocratic katherine rake director of the fawcett society campaigning group said the institutes survey shows encouraging movement in the right direction but there is clearly an awful long way to go if women make up one in seven directors that means six in seven are men the largest companies continue to be a largely male preserve dame marjorie scardino is the only female chief executive of a ftse company and only of the seats on the boards of britains blue chip companies were filled by women last year a guardian survey last month found of the top companies had no woman director and there were no women in the strong millionaires club of sevenfigure corporate earners the equal opportunities commission found women were hugely underrepresented in positions of influence in business the police the media and the judiciary just of top business leaders and national newspaper editors were women of the senior judiciary and senior police ranks and of senior army personnel a recent spate of tribunal cases brought by highflying women alleging sex discrimination among their employers suggests that many who make it through the glass ceiling encounter enduring hostility the pay advantage enjoyed by women department managers is not matched by their women employees the annual earnings of women working fulltime are of mens about women a year in england and wales have to take legal action after being sacked because they were pregnant but the survey showed a management career is starting to offer women more equal opportunities as women gained greater influence at a senior management level the proportion of female resignations fell female labour turnover dropped from to over the past twelve months whereas male resignations jumped from to the survey found women managers salaries rose by last year while mens went up it was the eighth successive year that womens earnings outperformed mens by a statistical quirk the average pay of department heads fell and the men lost more than the women an institute spokesman said this probably reflected changes in the survey sample rather than pay cuts for individuals women managers working in the chem ical it and food industries earned more than their counterparts in the public and financial sectors engineering offered the greatest average growth for womens salaries up to over the last year women managers earned more than men in research and development compared with julie mellor chair of the eoc said its heartening to see that uk companies are increasingly realising the business benefits of capitalising on the vast pool of skills and experience that female executives have to offer but a lack of flexible working options at different levels is still preventing many women getting the experience they need to get to the top and while the survey suggests that average salaries for women at certain management levels are exceeding those of their male counterparts a lack of flexible working will prevent many women taking better paid jobs this is one of the reasons why women working parttime earn a shocking less per hour than men working fulltime christine hayhurst the institutes director of professional affairs said huge efforts have been made to work towards equality in the workplace and organisations must continue to put measures in place to meet these demands if they dont there is a real danger that we will continue to see a rise in the number of tribunal discrimination cases,2004-09,glass ceiling

youve got that shiny new promotion and the job looks great but do you really know what youre letting yourself in for have you been chosen because you are capable or because you are disposable women who have successfully crashed through the glass ceiling to be appointed to leadership roles in business may find themselves up against yet another invisible barrier the socalled glass cliff according to new research from the university of exeter women at the top of the ladder are being promoted into risky and precarious leadership positions where the chance of failure is high if everything spirals downwards they get the blame in an article in the times last year women were criticised for failing their companies after managing to land boardroom jobs women were blamed for wreaking havoc on share prices and profit after seemed firms directed by them were reportedly performing poorly compared to those directed by men the conclusion businesses would be better off without women on the board psychologists dr michelle ryan and professor alex haslam were not convinced that corporate failings were the fault of women saying negative outcomes experienced by companies that appoint female leaders are the consequence of a secondwave of discrimination that women must overcome in the workplace their research the glass cliff evidence that women are overrepresented in precarious leadership positions published in the british journal of management found that women rather than being incapable of getting the work done were getting landed with the dirty jobs carrying a high risk of failure ryan and haslams investigation discovered that firms who had been doing badly for some time before appointing a leader were more likely to elect a woman into the leadership position than a man and though in general there has been an increase in female managers at other levels they argue once women attain these leadership roles their performance is placed under close scrutiny evaluation is not always positive women receive positive evaluations when their leadership roles are defined in feminine terms on traditional masculine measures their effectiveness is often perceived to be lower than that of men the research showed an encouraging outlook for women leaders who weathered difficult times their companies showed marked improvement in performance kate swann appointed chief executive of wh smith when the company was in trouble is a prime example of a woman promoted to a precarious position in the year since swann accepted the unenviable task of turning the corporation around she featured prominently in the media and endured criticism of her management techniques as ryan says women in such positions are highly visible and hence come under much more attack than a man in a similar situation in of the ftse companies did not have a women executive director the poor representation of women in the boardroom was an issue being examined by the chartered institute of personnel development cipd it isnt that women arent capable of fulfilling leaderships roles says cipd equal opportunities adviser dianah worman but if performance isnt successful a wrong association is made that it is down to it being a woman in the job we wanted to look at the real reasons as to why these roles were so challenging ryan and haslam feel that glass cliffs cannot simply be explained by out and out sexism it appears the process leading to the recruitment of a woman into a precarious leadership position is subtle to look at possible reasons the researchers carried out an online survey as a followup to the study over respondents took part and provided a number of suggestions the old boys network and the lack of support structures for females in highlevel positions may play a part as one female middle manager said a glass cliff requires a competent individual managers will figure out which candidates can handle the role women are capable yet expendable because no one is rooting for their success stephanie klass a partner at legal firm berg amp co says women will get the poisoned chalice the job nobody else wants how do we deal with glass cliffs its early days since this trend has only just come to light and there is some resistance haslam says men are very much in denial about the reality of this phenomenon acceptance of the issue is obviously fundamental to tackling it managing diversity is also a key factor says worman these positions come about when the organisation has a difficult vacancy to fill attracting different people to the role who see it as challenging the historical company structure isnt adept at managing that role and providing the support necessary for success worman feels there is a lack of flexibility in the traditional role highcalibre women will go off and set up on their own rather than attempt to fit into an inflexible organisation this is not good news for businesses wanting to embrace diversity changes wont transpire overnight since traditional management styles are entrenched in corporate structures recruiting women into supported executive roles takes time but its also important to recognise that glass cliffs are not the exclusive domain of large corporations they operate on many levels in industry and politics and crucially they are not just a gender thing as other research has shown they happen to

sometimes its hard to be a woman break through the glass ceiling and you find yourself on the edge of a glass cliff alex haslam a social psychologist at exeter university told the british association meeting in exeter yesterday of the glass cliff phenomenon whereby women are promoted into jobs that carry a high chance of failure it was reported in that uk business had gone downhill in the previous year as the number of female directors on the boards of ftse companies had risen by a newspaper commentator said the triumphant march of women into the countrys boardrooms has wreaked havoc on companies performance and share prices professor haslam said what we found was that in all of those cases women had only been appointed after company performance had slumped quite dramatically so if you like women are parachuted into rather hazardous leadership situations what is typically happening is that if everything is going well with a company there is no motivation for change you can carry on with the same jobs for the boys approach men were not necessarily overtly biased their friends were mostly men and they tended to turn to them when filling plum jobs but looked to strangers who were more likely to be women when recruiting in difficult times it was also suggested that women were good in times of crisis but prof haslam said the way that is conceptualised in the management literature is think manager think male tim radford,2004-09,sometimes hard woman break glass ceiling find edge glass cliff alex haslam social psychologist exeter university told british association meeting exeter yesterday glass cliff phenomenon whereby woman promoted job carry high chance failure wa reported uk business gone downhill previous year number female director board ftse company risen newspaper commentator said triumphant march woman country boardroom ha wreaked havoc company performance share price professor haslam said found wa case woman appointed company performance slumped quite dramatically like woman parachuted rather hazardous leadership situation typically happening everything going well company motivation change carry job boy approach men necessarily overtly biased friend mostly men tended turn filling plum job looked stranger likely woman recruiting difficult time wa also suggested woman good time crisis prof haslam said way conceptualised management literature think manager think male tim radford,"['sometimes', 'hard', 'woman', 'break', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'find', 'edge', 'glass', 'cliff', 'alex', 'haslam', 'social', 'psychologist', 'exeter', 'university', 'told', 'british', 'association', 'meeting', 'exeter', 'yesterday', 'glass', 'cliff', 'phenomenon', 'whereby', 'woman', 'promoted', 'job', 'carry', 'high', 'chance', 'failure', 'wa', 'reported', 'uk', 'business', 'gone', 'downhill', 'previous', 'year', 'number', 'female', 'director', 'board', 'ftse', 'company', 'risen', 'newspaper', 'commentator', 'said', 'triumphant', 'march', 'woman', 'country', 'boardroom', 'ha', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'company', 'performance', 'share', 'price', 'professor', 'haslam', 'said', 'found', 'wa', 'case', 'woman', 'appointed', 'company', 'performance', 'slumped', 'quite', 'dramatically', 'like', 'woman', 'parachuted', 'rather', 'hazardous', 'leadership', 'situation', 'typically', 'happening', 'everything', 'going', 'well', 'company', 'motivation', 'change', 'carry', 'job', 'boy', 'approach', 'men', 'necessarily', 'overtly', 'biased', 'friend', 'mostly', 'men', 'tended', 'turn', 'filling', 'plum', 'job', 'looked', 'stranger', 'likely', 'woman', 'recruiting', 'difficult', 'time', 'wa', 'also', 'suggested', 'woman', 'good', 'time', 'crisis', 'prof', 'haslam', 'said', 'way', 'conceptualised', 'management', 'literature', 'think', 'manager', 'think', 'male', 'tim', 'radford']",171
the equal opportunities commission called for a statutory code of practice last night to protect women during pregnancy after finding evidence that many employers do not understand the complicated jigsaw of current law research from the shopworkers union usdaw established that twothirds of its pregnant women members did not get a safety risk assessment as required by law they were commonly put

action after being sacked because they were pregnant julie mellor the commissions chairwoman said others face pay cuts demotion hostile treatment or are made to work in an unsafe environment the impact on these womens lives and the health and safety of their baby can be disastrous the research found working women in britain become pregnant in the course of each year businesses with fewer than employees were likely to have a pregnant employee only one year in nearly a quarter of women who made an employment tribunal claim were dismissed within hours of telling their employer they were pregnant one in five women who returned to work for the same employer after maternity leave were put on a lower grade or level of job more than a third of employers felt that pregnancy was an undue cost burden on the organisation but some employers were unaware of their right to reclaim statutory maternity pay the commission quoted examples of extreme unpleasantness from employers when told a

dads shun nappy changing for work the bbc announced when official figures recently revealed that just one in five fathers is using the paid paternity leave entitlement in fact all the media has interpreted the low takeup as a sign that fathers would rather work than be with their children says tom beardshaw of the pressure group fathers direct but just because fathers are shunning statutory paternity leave it doesnt mean they are shunning nappy changing we know from research that fathers are actually spending far more time with their children than ever before the simple reason for the low takeup he says is the pay level which currently stands at a week for two weeks to take time off work at that rate of pay when your partner is probably on statutory maternity pay and you have more things to buy than usual like cots and nappies is not exactly enticing agrees rebecca gill policy officer for the tuc fathers were thrilled in april to win the right to two weeks paid paternity leave she says but the governments forecast that takeup would be nearer was extremely optimistic given the terms personally to take home only a week is a major drop in salary at a time when money needs to be watched says ian feeney of cheshire i will become a dad for the first time in the next few weeks but there is no way i would take that two weeks paternity leave because the allowance is just too small agrees paul akinwale from london it doesnt help that many expectant fathers dont even know paternity leave exists and that to qualify for it you have to notify your employer weeks before the baby is due says gill so for fathers who suddenly realise a couple of weeks before the birth that theyve got these new rights its too late for most men the solution lies in taking some of their annual leave entitlement instead after all its fully paid and giving notice doesnt tend to be such an issue some workers are lucky enough to have an employer who provides all new fathers with a set number of days off on full pay nevertheless other men feel that taking time off around their childs birth isnt an option even if money isnt an issue malcolm bruce the liberal democrats shadow trade and industry secretary blames our macho culture it may be that men dont want to take time off work to help look after their newborn baby because theyre worried what their male colleagues will think worse they may be afraid their boss will hold it against them mike emmott employee relations adviser at the chartered institute of personnel and development agrees that this can be an issue we know that some fathers worry that they may not seen to be serious if they take more than a day or two off little wonder when you consider stories like the investment bank that recently offered a man a promotion on condition that he signed away his rights to paternity leave it was deemed that his new role would be too senior to take time off to be with his children explains alexandra james senior researcher at the work foundation many men have even taken to parenting by stealth and not just when the baby is newborn we know they use offsite client meetings to cover up for time spent looking after their children rather than risk appearing uncommitted or less masculine in front of colleagues she says dinosaur dads the previous generation of corporate men who were supported by stayathome wives are the worst at encouraging this kind of culture according to the work foundation its research has found that while such bosses have woken up to the issue of employing mothers few seem to realise that this means they now employ a different kind of father they need to recognise that the inevitable result of more mothers having jobs is that both she and the father share domestic duties mind you says james we have found some interesting exceptions when it comes to second families many fathers who realised they missed out the first time round are saying they dont want to make the same mistake again also putting pressure on fathers not to take paternity leave is the uks longhours culture fulltime staff in britain now work among the longest hours in europe with the latest research from internet bank intelligent finance showing that threequarters of britons are working longer hours than their contracts state not surprisingly this is having a detrimental effect on family life the study revealed according to kate stanley head of social policy at the institute of public policy research many new fathers actually increase the number of hours they spend at work after the birth of their child among the possible reasons are proving commitment to their employer and earning the extra cash needed when the baby arrives she says it may also be that men just dont feel caring is their role and therefore its their job to be out working thats why we need to think hard about how we can persuade men that they do have caring responsibilities and build this into any policies we make many people believe the solution to getting more men to take up paternity leave in the uk is to take the lead from countries such as sweden which has had a far more generously paid system in place for decades but stanley isnt so sure in the takeup rate in sweden was still only this confirms that if men dont see themselves as having caring responsibilities they wont take up paternity leave no matter what you pay them so could parental leave which enables both mother and father to share baby duties be the answer stanley believes it could back in when norway had a similar system that the uk does now takeup was but then they introduced a system providing weeks of parental leave paid at of earnings or weeks of parental leave at of earnings crucially four of these weeks can only be taken by fathers and if they dont take them they are lost likewise nine of the weeks must be taken by the mother the rest can be switched between them takeup has since risen to the key to getting men to take their leave she says has been to give a very clear message that parental leave isnt just about women that men have a role at home after a baby is born too disillusioned with the governments failure to get men to spend more time with their kids some uk companies including bt have started addressing the issue themselves caroline waters bts director of people networks explains we dont want the fathers we employ to work so much that it has a detrimental effect on their families in fact many of the fathers who work for us have told us that parental leave is just part of this issue they want to be able to spend more time with their children well beyond them being newborn no individual has to explain why they want to work flexibly explains waters as a result of bt employees now work flexibly and the proportion of men and women doing so is totally representative of the malefemale split in the company this is quite unique with most businesses reporting that takeup is much higher among women in fact bts efforts have had wider repercussions than even they expected they have promoted equality at home and at work one of the things that has traditionally prevented women from having greater access to the world of work is that men dont have much access to the world at home says waters so by helping men get greater access to the home we are helping women too,2004-09,dad shun nappy changing work bbc

were we once more easily shocked back in the s when the likes of erin pizzey began to campaign on domestic violence and we saw those appalling photos of horribly bruised and swollen womens faces it was a great cause thousands marched and campaigned for womens refuges it was as if society was finally lifting a huge stone and confronting the squirming truth that existed in almost every street hidden by a great conspiracy of silence and shame domestic violence was going to be stopped or at least squeezed to the very borders of british life laws would change and some did the casual acceptance of wifebeating by drunken angry men would be ended for ever easier divorce and more active social services intervention would save huge numbers of women from intolerable lives like backtoback housing and the institutionalised beating of children britains legacy of domestic violence would go it never quite happened somehow somewhere along the line the political world lost interest or at least lost the concentration the yearbyyear focus on a problem that it is able to apply to other issues from smoking to childrens rights the yob culture to migration now thanks entirely to women ministers in the government the subject is back on the political agenda a new bill will bring in greater powers for the police and the court to protect victims and prosecute abusers and will make it an arrestable offence to breach a nonmolestation order but that alone is not enough everyone needs to be made aware of the scale of this problem and focus on ways of identifying it new research commissioned by jacqui smith the equalities minister shows that its not only the battered women and their children who suffer there is a financial cost too with time off work for injuries caused by domestic violence costing employers bn a year the research by professor sylvia walby at the university of leeds shows that domestic violence also costs the criminal justice system around bn almost a quarter of the total budget for violent crime and the nhs and social services spend more than bn dealing with it its sad that women ministers still find it necessary to highlight domestic violence by focusing on the costs to the economy but as one of them admits sometimes it is the only way you can get through to male policymakers clearly far from shrivelling domestic violence has continued to be a british scourge tony blair spent his first day back at work in london highlighting labours laudable war on the yob culture of the streets and the use of antisocial behaviour orders to crack down on marauding youths noisy neighbours and prostitutes but the violent culture we have created doesnt start in the street it is rampant behind closed doors jacqui smith quotes figures showing that on average two british women are killed every week in domestic attacks and that every minute of every day police receive a call from a woman suffering violence yobs get married or have relationships too and they come from all social classes the habits of violence learned at school or in the pub are taken home and remembered later but that part of the story is rarely discussed why not i suspect the basic problem is horribly simple we have become an imagefixated shortattentionspan culture and the reality of domestic violence is simply not vivid or surprising enough to keep people watching or talking compare it with other kinds of violence gangs of youths female as well as male make good television the language the style the clothes the frenzied speed of assaults or drug dealing the whole buzz of it may be repellent but also insistently attracts journalistic attention a visual culture needs the specific the oneoff the more beautiful and innocent the victim the more easily our emotions are stirred think of those heartbreaking photos of holly and jessica in their football shirts theirs were appalling hideous killings but murders of children by people outside their families the old nightmare of the stranger in the night are thankfully very rare domestic violence is not and it rejects the rules of easy media interest it takes place in private beyond the reach of cameras it occurs between people who feeling shame embarrassment fear even sometimes love are unlikely to seek publicity it is mundane with very ordinary perpetrators not sinister stalking murderers but simply boozedup angry disappointed ordinary blokes you never know meeting them in the pub or office whos the wifebeater for news editors domestic violence is all a bit drab millions give money to charities to combat disease or to help children who are not exercised by domestic violence thats for who feminists ministers at any rate somebody else this is a scourge that somehow lacks highprofile householdname martyrs and seems to bore crusading journalism because of the media cultures lack of interest politicians who do campaign on this including those in the current government are fighting to be noticed and usually failing mps looking for headlines look elsewhere the result is twisted priorities perhaps the most bizarre example this autumn is the suggestion that to revive the loyalty and enthusiasm of labour backbenchers the government is finally to force through a ban on foxhunting this is without doubt a vivid media issue from the telegenic packs of hounds and cantering chaps in pink coats to the angry marches through whitehall and the chanting ranks of animal rights activists it involves angry confrontations in the commons wellfunded lobbyists tony banks sounding off in fine form and splits on the tory front bench what fun but i cant believe i am the only person who finds the whole business ludicrously and tediously irrelevant to the real issues actual labour voters are struggling with to me the deaths of a couple of dozen women a year and the punching armbreaking and stabbing of scores of others is more important by far mps who kept banging on about that and forced us to listen would be doing a great deal more for progressive politics than those diving in to the foxhunting fray and ministers are at work apart from the new bill theres a pilot project in bristol to involve midwives in identifying domestic violence since shockingly of domestic violence starts or is exacerbated during pregnancy across this government there is a real attempt to link up schools hospitals and the police in a wider campaign if no is really looking for ways to restore the support and interest of labour voters it could do worse than crusade to save ordinary women in ordinary

fathers should spend more time alone with their children in order to strengthen relationships and help ensure bonds are not broken if parents split up the minister charged with easing the pain of custody battles said yesterday in his first interview since moving to the education department last month as children and families minister lord filkin told the guardian that forthcoming government reforms to help divorcing parents resolve child contact disputes without prolonged court battles would help more separated fathers see more of their children but the minister himself a divorced father of three said he had not been swayed by the highprofile protests of the fathersjustice campaign group which he called extreme nor the lobbying of the singer bob geldof who has secured several meetings with ministers but he did concede that the governments voice had been drowned out in recent months by fathers rights campaigners some fathers had been too wet about persisting in seeking contact with their children if first knocked back he said lord filkin whose ministerial brief covers the areas in which the state touches most closely on family life said fathers now enjoyed a far closer relationship with their children than they had years ago but he said there was plenty of scope for fathers to do more and particularly to enjoy time spent alone with their children many of us would say that time by yourself with children is a rich experience while the state should not tell parents what they should do he said children wanted to feel that both parents were involved in their lives for fathers it could be the usual stuff going to the school open day but its also cooking a meal occasionally or taking them on an outing by themselves kids like that fathers involvement lightened the load of parenting and helped ease the situation if relationships broke down he said divorced mothers were sometimes reluctant to hand over children to their fathers as part of contact agreements because they are worried about whether he can hack it does he really know how to change a nappy that has been one of the causes of the problems about contact a green paper published by the government in july and currently out to consultation sets out a range of measures intended to ease the plight of separating parents there is widespread concern among parents lawyers and campaigners that the present system in which one in ten cases goes to court is drawn out inefficient and increases the suffering of children and parents alike parenting plans central to the proposals is a significantly increased emphasis on mediation in place of going to court with more help and advice for parents the green paper suggests the introduction of parenting plans templates to help resolve disputes showing how parents in similar situations have reached workable agreements on child contact the package does not however include guaranteed rights to equal contact for both parents the socalled split advocated by fathersjustice and by geldof in a recent channel broadside and backed by the conservatives the option had been rejected lord filkin said because to say that should be central thrust of policy is to put the interests of parents at the centre of the debate rather than the interests of the child as well as not always being best for the child a halfandhalf division of time would in many cases not be workable he said the government argues that men already have an equal right in law to have responsibility for and a meaningful relationship with their children so long as it is safe a process of mediation rather than an imposed court decision would also help change parents behaviour to allow them to make contact arrangements work said lord filkin who launched the review of the issue last autumn while in his former role at the department of constitutional affairs damage the fact of parental separation was less harmful to children than witnessing bitter arguments he said parental separation is upsetting for children but it is not longterm damaging it is the conflict that is damaging if parents keep on and on rowing or one parent is rubbishing the other that really is damaging to the child and there is evidence to support that so we have to find better ways of making the system work so it is more likely to make more agreements workable in the interests of the child for those parents who do not abide by the arrangements there are proposals for tougher enforcement including community service orders this is an element of the green paper that lord filkin pledges is beyond consultation however figures suggest that the number of mothers withholding access is far lower than fathersjustice suggests only of separated fathers return to court because their expartner has frustrated a contact order and twice as many parents with residence mainly mothers as separated fathers wanted their partners contact with children to increase fathers had too often opted to disappear under the current system he said if some fathers disappear because they make a bit of a halfhearted attempt to get contact and then get the brushoff thats sad and it is a bit wet as well we really hope there will be less of that because its really important that fathers recognise how important they are to their kids though reluctant to discuss his own family life he was married to the former parliamentary standards commissioner elizabeth filkin the families minister concedes that his experience helps him understand the pain of divorced parents more acutely with some things in life when you have them happen to you you dont need to empathise to understand them you just need memory i dont have to imagine what it feels like for parents,2004-10,father spend time alone child order

beware of being misled by the success of the first generation of girls to have beaten boys in all key exam stages at school and university on some fronts they have generated a genuine genderquake in key professions that were once dominated by men more women than men are now being recruited to the fasttrack senior civil service promotion programme as well as in law and medicine indeed the latest recruitment figures for these letter professions are startling with female trainee solicitors and female medical students outnumbering their male contemporaries by almost two to one but these specific successes should not be mistaken for a more general trend as a wellresearched pamphlet published yesterday by the equal opportunities commission documents women still suffer serious discrimination at work almost years after the sex discrimination act and their hourly pay is nearly less than mens years after the equal pay act what has gone wrong at a downing street summit on gender and productivity yesterday three key causes were identified occupational segregation that locks large numbers of women into lowpaid work and locks many more out of better paid jobs straight discrimination and the continuing difficulty of combining work with caring responsibilities segregation begins in school where girls are still given too little encouragement to try nontraditional work but employers need a change of attitude too one driver of reform is the skills shortage facing some of the most maledominated and betterpaid sectors plumbing engineering construction tentative moves have begun but bolder initiatives are needed about one in five women who return to the same employer after maternity leave come back to a lower grade ministers have recognised the need to make affordable and universal childcare a new frontier for the welfare state but it will take years to put in place gordon brown conceded yesterday that too many governments including labour governments had kept female equality on the fringe he acknowledged women workers could play a central role in solving britains skills shortage now all we need is action this should start with a more appropriate curriculum and better career guidance for girls at school it could go on to require companies to carry out pay audits and like norway to insist on the appointment of more women directors on corporate boards and then to overhaul the current discrimination law so that it is simpler and easier to apply,2004-10,beware misled success first generation girl beaten boy key exam stage school university front generated genuine

a major problem for grassroots organisers especially if we are women is that neither stop the war nor the unions are independent of political parties and both sabotage any organising that doesnt serve

proposals to extend paid maternity leave beyond the existing six months should feature prominently in labours general election manifesto patricia hewitt said today the trade and industry secretary also announced plans to narrow the gap between men and womens pay by giving women better job opportunities in traditionally maledominated areas ms hewitt said ministers were looking carefully at the implications for employers and taxpayers of extending paid maternity leave but stressed that the idea was a high priority for the government earlier this year employers representatives voiced concerns after ms hewitt floated the idea at present mothers are entitled to six months paid leave at of salary for the first few weeks then a week for the remainder and six months unpaid at labours annual conference in brighton the chancellor gordon brown endorsed ms hewitts idea saying labour would set as a goal for another term in office a total of months paid parental leave in order to give parents more choice to stay at home for the first year of their childs life at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission and held at downing street today ms hewitt was asked whether she stood by her idea she said of course i stand by it and it is a shared goal across government we continue to increase the support and the choice that we give parents about how they balance work and family clearly one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months we are looking at how quickly we can do that clearly there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost obviously i hope it will feature high in the manifesto on which we fight the next election ms hewitt also announced plans to give women better job opportunities in traditionally male industries such as it construction engineering and science the proposals are part of an initiative to close the gap between the average hourly earnings of men and women in fulltime employment she cited research suggesting that over of all working women are concentrated in just occupations which typically pay the least and although women make up of the total workforce they make up less than in engineering and just in construction the new plans include careers advisers offering more information about traditionally male jobs to schoolgirls a new drive to increase the number of female entrepreneurs starting up their own businesses funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs in those industries adult education taster courses for men and women in nontraditional subjects such as plumbing for women and childcare for men ms hewitt said it is not governments job to dictate employment options to people but we must give women more choice if we are to address the chronic pay gap getting rid of career sexism is vital to closing the pay gap and i have asked our women and work commission to come up with further proposals it is also vital to british industry and our wider economy in a time of fierce global competition we need to plug our skills gap and cannot afford to neglect anyones talent ms hewitt also announced that the dti will provide funding for an equal pay experts panel run by the tuc the project will advise companies on equal pay reviews and build on the tuc equal pay project which has already trained more than union equal pay representatives based in companies,2004-10,proposal extend paid

even those entering the workplace at are choosing occupations along traditional gender lines the continuing trend means deeprooted inequalities in pay and employment prospects are mapped out for young people from the very first day of their working lives the tuc report warns even among teenagers in their first jobs young women earn less than their male counterparts blowing apart the myth that the effect on womens careers of having children is the sole cause of pay inequality union chiefs will today call on the government to challenge the stereotype images of jobs for the boys and for the girls

courage it took her to leave literally everything behind that was the price she had to pay to start a new safer life but the one person she believes could have supported her more was her boss id told her what was going on at that time she was the only person id told but rather than providing any help she made my life times worse by getting rid of me julies story is by no means unique one in four women will suffer domestic violence according to victims charity refuge and many of them face the added burden of disciplinary action at work the place they often feel to be their only safe haven the government believes its high time employers offered greater support to people with personal problems like domestic violence not just because they have a duty of care towards their employees but because its in their own interests the cost of domestic violence a report by professor sylvia walby at the university of leeds assesses the cost to the uk economy of time off work due to injuries inflicted on one partner by another at nearly bn in addition domestic violence can influence an employees morale work performance and productivity as well as their career development in the worstcase scenario the employer may even lose the victim to death two women are killed each week in the uk by their current or expartner says refuges spokeswoman olivia lamb of course my ability to do my job was affected says julie i was living in fear my mental health was a mess but i really do believe that i had been working in a supportive environment it wouldnt have been like that in fact my next employer was a major influence in me leaving my husband she pointed me in the direction of proper help and made it clear that she would stand by me even if things got bad the reality is that very few companies have a policy on domestic violence and some people including dianah worman diversity adviser to the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd believe that developing one is not the answer its not about policies or firms taking a parental role hr couldnt broach the subject with someone she says stephanie klass commercial law partner at berg amp co solicitors agrees that employers need to tread very carefully i do think those who believe staff may be experiencing domestic violence should enquire as to whether that individual needs help but i dont think they should voice their suspicions directly and if such enquiries or offers of help are consistently refused the employer must respect that decision she says the fact that domestic violence remains so hidden poses a major problem for employers even if they do want to help according to rebecca gill policy officer on womens equality at the tuc many of the women we anonymously surveyed on the subject had lived with domestic violence for to years and had never told anybody she says in fact the reason we did the survey was because trade unions were coming to us saying that they were facing disciplinary cases on behalf of these women but that they were reluctant to say why theyd been absent but she insists that this is no excuse for employers avoiding the issue they have a major role to play we are not asking them to be counsellors but to signpost women to where they can get help and put in place any procedures that could help just having a poster on the noticeboard with a phone number could save a life meanwhile a large company could help a victim who does come forward about their abuse by offering a transfer to an office in another city which could enable them to escape the violence and begin a new life we know that financial dependence is a crucial part of the psychological abuse that a lot of these victims suffer others go much further domestic violence suffered by an employee at south hams and west devon primary care trust prompted the trust to tackle the issue for all staff sue behenna then the hr manager says benefits for employees suffering from abuse now include the provision of temporary mobile phones special paid leave financial loans and redeployment its often seen as a taboo private subject that employers have no business to get involved in but i felt that was wrong she says its not only victims who have been receptive to the policy she says many managers had unwittingly stumbled across the issue before and tried to help but in hindsight realised theyd been clumsy they appreciate the measured approach we now have nationwide building society has a policy that is particularly effective because victims dont have tell their employers about the violence to gain the support its emphasis on worklife balance for example allows people to take time off at short notice for short periods without saying why in addition nationwide provides a welfare fund with interestfree loans to help alleviate immediate financial problems plus aroundtheclock access to free and confidential counselling services if people are happy at work theyll do a good job and there are also benefits for us around staff loyalty says spokesman tim hughes other employers are focusing on helping people not to become victims in the first place and some even help potential perpetrators to develop better ways of coping with stress and companies that offer employee assistance programmes external and general counselling and information services are often helping victims without realising it kevin friery director of counselling at right corecare says he hears from many domestic violence victims we recently had a case of someone who lived with a particularly nasty man and the only way she was going to be able to break away from the violent and drugridden relationship was to physically move away we worked with her employer to get her redeployed domestic violence can exist in isolation but it is often linked with other issues like alcohol and drug addiction thats one of the reasons i believe employers need to have policies around all these things says friery they need to accept that all personal problems can spill into the workplace and that they should therefore have a role in providing support as with domestic violence though few employers so far have taken this on board in fact many take a contrary approach having followed the trend from the states of introducing random drink and drugs tests which if positive can lead to instant dismissal friery believes this is misguided testing should not be carried out unless the employer is prepared to take a sympathetic manner the employee may be dependent which is essentially an issue of ill health and should be treated as such he explains especially friery points out because it is more and more often stress in the workplace that causes an employee to turn to drink or drugs in the first place consequently right core care is among a growing number of organisations involved in helping employers to formulate a firm but compassionate drink and drugs policy in fact many of the policies that work are similar to those in place for domestic violence providing counselling and advice on where to get treatment attempting to prevent the problem occurring in the first place and enabling staff to take time off to deal with their problem where necessary as well as accepting that many employees may not want to admit to having a problem says friery alcohol concern which also helps employers create policies covering both alcohol and drug use agrees this is the way forward we too put the emphasis on rehabilitation rather than disciplinary procedures says a spokesman in fact we encourage employers to create a culture in which staff who have a problem can come forward rather than being caught out in random testing and this believes dianah worman of the cipd is the approach that employers should take when it comes to all personal problems that affect their employees working lives employers need to develop a climate of trust so people feel they can talk about it she says but if the government as well as many charities get their way employers of the future will have a far more intercessionary role than that and the boundary between home and work may become increasingly

an independent thinktank claims the governments childcare policies fail to meet the needs of disabled ethnic minority and workingclass white families a report by focus institute for rights and social transformation first to be published this week said that present childcare services are targeted at particular groups and reach only of all children living in poverty in most disadvantaged wards it said that black and ethnic minority and white workingclass families are less likely to make use of childcare than middleclass white people because of a lack of accessibility choice quality and affordability in services it argued for legislative powers and childcare revenue streams to be given to integrated childcare active partnerships icaps which are run by local people to develop more suitably tailored childcare it also said informal childcare when family and community networks are used by parents need to be recognised a lot of families from disadvantaged groups depend on these arrangements because of racial and faithbased forms of discrimination they experience through existing services informal childcare is also more affordable and accessible for these families children who have special educational needs are also often denied childcare places because staff cannot cope with their needs the prime minister tony blair promised affordable childcare for all families in his speech to the labour party conference last month jagtar singh director of first said in effect the government is trying to impose its own cultural model of childcare which will fail to meet the needs of a wide range of communities including white working class communities it is impossible for a highly centralised state to determine how the range and complexity of local childcare needs can best be met this can only be done at a local level first argues that parents will have trust in childcare services if they are developed locally figures from the department for education and skills dfes recognise that certain groups identified by firsts research face difficulties concerning childcare provision a dfes spokeswoman said as a result of market failure to deliver childcare provision in disadvantaged wards to the degree necessary to meet the needs of families in those communities the government focused much of its efforts on strengthening provision in those areas where it can make a difference and have a greater impact this has meant that there has been an effect on minority ethnic groups the sure start unit is dedicated to tackling equality diversity and inclusion issues within

the tories pledged today to scrap the beleaguered family court service in a bid to ensure fathers and grandparents get better access to their children in a clear nod to the cause championed by activist group fathersjustice the shadow spokeswoman for families theresa may promised to axe the children and family court advisory support service cafcass in a separate move she also pledged to replace the family court system with a new mediation service ms may called the introduction of cafcass under labour the biggest mistake in family policy and said her party would seek to abolish it to end the heartbroken stories of parents denied fair access to their kids it is a bureaucratic shambles it is deeply unjust and it is letting families down she said in a confused message she blamed cafcass for decisions actually made by family courts the role of cafcass is to coordinate the work of guardians who support children involved in custody disputes the body has been beset with problems since the decision to abolish the selfemployed status of guardians which led to many leaving the service ms may said that within the first month of a tory government a bill would be drawn up giving a presumption of coparenting and a right for both parents to be involved in bringing up their children where couples separate we will ensure that the law serves the best interest of the child and children deserve to see both parents she added courts should be the last resort not the first the aim will be to intervene early to make sure disputes dont have to go to court but are sorted out quickly in the best interests of the children in an apparent reference to situations involving domestic violence ms may added that child safety will remain a priority she also struck an inclusive note for families acknowledging unmarried and gay couples as families while still asserting the tory preference for marriage as the best environment for bringing up children tacitly conceding previous tory failures to properly represent family in government which is placed under threat as never before ms may nevertheless failed to announce anything else directly targeting families or women drop in female vote meanwhile a report out today claimed that the conservative party is going in reverse gear in its bid to woo women voters further dimming its prospects at the next general election only a quarter of women voters are satisfied with michael howards performance with his tenure more popular among male voters according to a report published today by the fawcett society dr katherine rake director of the fawcett society said this report shows that the conservatives still have a long way to go if they want to win back womens votes the party urgently needs to formulate convincing policies that will appeal to the female electorate if they are to recover electorally and in order for these policies to be credible they must be presented and delivered by more women increasing female representation tory delegate joan spiers said that more female tories in senior positions would be unlikely because of an unfair selection process i would like to see an evenhanded deal she said the selection process is usually the twinsetandpearls brigade and a lot of men if they get a young attractive striving young woman they often reject her i have often heard people say you should be at home with your children surrey county councillor marian myland agreed i want to see them do more she said i want to them to say something about womens problems that they are not yet addressing such as more tax breaks for childcare and elderly care and education crawley tory councillor kirstie heal disagreed however the ethos of the tory party for me is equal to men and women it is about families it is about supporting small government i believe this applies to all ages it is a worry for me that the policies are not appealing when we were canvassing we didnt find women found that they

pilot schemes offering extra support to victims of domestic violence are preventing court cases from collapsing according to figures from the crown prosecution service cps measures such as fasttrack domestic violence courts extra training for prosecutors magistrates and police and the use of advocates for victims have all helped to make the system more effective a pilot scheme in gwent has reduced the proportion of cases where prosecutors offer no evidence at trial from to between january and june this year with guilty pleas increasing from to the pilot is focusing on building stronger cases and ending cases as soon as it is clear they are not viable taking into account support for victims over the same period a pilot in croydon has seen cases collapsing before trial falling from to

domestic violence courts held one day a week training of cps staff magistrates and police and use of advocates to enhance victim support and participation the cps stressed that these are only preliminary results for the two pilots which run until january however it said that increased satisfaction among victims in the criminal justice system has been recorded with more victims offered

the solicitor general harriet harman in a speech to a reception at last weeks labour party conference for victim support london thats why we need more of it she said of victim support work including domestic violence rape and homophobic crime as areas needing particular support we want to see in our next manifesto that every victim of domestic violence and rape gets high levels of support she

encouraging to hear that moves have been made at croydon and gwent to treat the victims of domestic violence with particular sensitivity said spokesman andrew buckingham the fasttrack court system is a good idea to reduce the risk of delays providing that it doesnt give the victim and witnesses the impression that the process is being rushed through he added some victims retract their stories and evidence for a variety of reasons for example intimidation or reprisals by their partner expartner or their supporters or they may indeed wish to remain in the relationship with the abusive partner criminal justice professionals must be very sensitive to victims feelings and understand that theyre not just a means to an end to get cases heard and processed he said the governments domestic

not exceptional and furthermore that a professional qualification is a hallmark of equality this may be so in theory but in practice some professionals are better rewarded than others and that the

divorce lawyers who encourage warring couples to fight lengthy and lucrative court battles over their children rather than seek amicable agreements face curbs on legal aid under plans to reduce the pain of custody battles the move follows complaints that ambulancechasing lawyers make splitting up messier than it needs to be by encouraging parents to embark on lengthy aggressive cases likely to generate high fees mothers who refuse to let their former partners see children in defiance of a court order could also be denied legal aid to fight their cases in an attempt to ease the bitter public protests of divorced fathers lord filkin the minister for family law told the observer he was sensitive to arguments that absent parents often faced costs to pursue their rights while their partners benefited from taxpayers money despite being in breach of court the changes to legal aid form part of a drive to channel divorcing couples into mediation where couples thrash out their differences over access and maintenance with trained court welfare officers when you go into court you have two lawyers arguing everybody needs to promote their fullest case and it tends to get more extreme more adversarial and the judge hearing all of this tends to think what do i make all of this said filkin and he said that even if divorcing couples thought their ex was a swine they must be encouraged to see things from their childs viewpoint people are very upset about the end of the relationship they may still have ongoing animosity towards their partner but we have got to get across that even if you never want to see him again your daughter does need to filkin said ministers planned to change the legal aid system so that it rewarded attempts at mediation its not in the interests of the parent and not the child the legal services commission which is now drawing up the restructuring of legal aid calculates that it costs the taxpayer on average to take a family law case to court compared with if it is solved through mediation filkin plans to introduce a national network of mediation projects in the next parliament one project in essex involves judges directing parents who go to court to enter into negotiations with a court welfare officer about per cent of couples taking part reached agreement by themselves for more intractable disputes the government is piloting family resolution projects which aim to make parents understand the impact of warring behaviour on their children ministers are also introducing penalties for mothers who defy court arrangements for access to their children ranging from fines to having to pay compensation such as refunding the cost of a holiday booked by a father if at the last minute they refuse to let the child go to community sentences although judges can jail recalcitrant mothers most are reluctant because of the impact on the child the powers will be contained in a parental separation and adoption bill such measures may help appease the anger of the fathers rights movement however fathersjustice the most militant organisation insists that only a presumption of custody shared equally between mothers and fathers will

nursery assistants caring for the nations children earn less than many cleaners supermarket checkout assistants and call centre staff a report to be published this week will reveal that parents are often forced to rely on a young inexperienced and unqualified workforce earning low wages to care for young children at a crucial stage of development the study by the daycare trust found that a third of nursery workers were aged under while one in five were not educated to the equivalent of five gcses the reports call for a drive to recruit graduates and more men into childcare and developing better paid staff will raise serious questions over the value britons place on looking after children the report found that childcare workers were taking home an average gross salary of by contrast a cleaner can earn around a supermarket cashier and a bank clerk despite having far less responsibility than the average nursery assistant many families will pay more per hour to the decorator painting their home who can earn up to a year than to the person looking after their toddler all day the report found that childminders were earning as little as an hour well below the minimum wage registered childminder michelle shawring from basingstoke works a hour day five days a week and is doing a degree in child psychology she charges an hour minus the cost of nappies food and activities she said i dont think its even the minimum wage for year olds but i do it because i want to see children thrive in denmark and sweden childcare workers usually have degrees and are on a par with teachers a model the report suggests the uk could move towards by what we need to do is ensure that working in early years is as attractive an option as working in primary and secondary schools said stephen burke director of the daycare trust we are talking about the stage in a childs life that is critical to their life chances so we should be investing in these people although the shift in nursing to a graduate profession has led to accusations that better educated staff are too posh to wash viewing handling bedpans or bathing patients as beneath their dignity burke said that this need not happen with universityeducated childcare workers citing staff in scandinavian countries still being happy to change nappies graduates in denmark or sweden still do all the elements of caring that you associate with the job burke said they say thats a crucial part of a childs experience too the report concludes that with the supply of poorly educated women willing to take badly paid jobs drying up the sector risks even more severe labour shortages as well educated women seek more financially rewarding but perhaps less meaningful employment raising salaries could also help lure more men into childcare jobs with many parents particularly those with boys clamouring for male nannies and au pairs to act as role models the report notes that men are often said to exit as fast as they enter care

thousands of women have been helped over the past year as a result of the readers donated to our chosen nine domestic violence charities the seven smaller charities each received of the overall funding while national charities womens aid and refuge were given a combined to help launch the first jointlyrun hour national freephone helpline while the charities have used the funds in different ways they were unanimous in saying that through their generosity guardian and observer readers had saved the lives of some women and increased the security and safety of many more two women a week are murdered by a partner or former partner meaning support such as yours is literally lifesaving for some women said refuge advance in west london used its cash injection to support women through criminal court cases and assist to get nonmolestation orders the organisation also trained magistrates and district judges to ensure they have a better understanding of the fears women have about coming to court and facing their abuser advance was also able to use funds from the charity appeal as leverage to win further financial support from other organisations the money received by leedsbased halt helped the charity to cope with more than cases dealing with court protection orders children act orders and divorce and financial settlements the haven in wolverhampton was able to refurbish its main advice centre which provides specialist support skills needed to help women moving out of hostels and back into the community both the phoenix project in bolton and the montgomeryshire family crisis centre used a portion of their funding to develop projects in schools skilled workers from the welsh charity visit schools not only to work with teachers to open up the issue of domestic violence but also to give an opportunity for any children who are experiencing or witnessing domestic abuse the chance to come forward the new national helpline launched by refuge and womens aid has made a dramatic difference to the lives of hundreds of women over the past year in the past the charities had each offered their own service but even with funding from guardian and observer readers and other donors the demand is still far exceeding resources in the nine months to august the helpline received calls but were only able to answer this is in part because each phone call on average lasts more than an hour apart from the phone line the two charities also created a computerised database which details space availability in all uk refuges in the past helpline workers had to telephone each refuge each morning to find out about availability of rooms while the money donated has allowed all nine charities to provide muchneeded services it has also given a fillip to the staff and volunteers who work there the valuable donations allowed for so much and gave so many advantages said jackie richardson director of the montgomeryshire family crisis centre workers were

the government set about rehabilitating the image of the nanny state yesterday sending margaret hodge the ultrablairite childrens minister who is regarded by her enemies as the nannyinchief to do the awkward repair job in an unapologetic defence of state intervention she said for me its not a question of whether we should intrude in family life but how and when her move portrayed by the conservatives as proof of the governments meddlesome intent came as she prepared to publish a national childcare strategy next week backed up by advice manuals for parents on how to bring up a child she said critics of the nanny state misunderstood the role of nannies good nannies dont just tell you what you cant do or must do they are about ensuring that you can make real and informed choices for yourself she told the institute for public policy research in london that she said was labours intention in its attempt to help parents bring up healthy and welladjusted children the right still promotes the absolute privacy of the family what happens behind closed doors in the intimacy of the family is to them a matter of private concern but for the left we want to promote opportunity for all and we want to enable every child to develop their full potential the state can be a powerful force for good in families and communities and we should celebrate not denigrate its role her colleagues may welcome this fightback but be relieved that it was left to ms hodge to risk the ire of rightwing politicians and editors by taking on the argument so forcefully ministers have become accustomed to tempering interventionist policies for fear of being accused of fostering a nanny state the lack of an outright ban on smoking in pubs in the public health white paper last week was a case in point ms hodge said if we seek equal opportunity for all we must logically act to support parenting in the home some may call that the nanny state but i call it a force for good the government would seek to provide support through a parenting helpline and volunteer advisers helping new parents adjust to caring for their babies the state also had a duty to intervene to help children escape disadvantage neglect and abuse that also could be portrayed as nannying but was a force for good yesterdays nanny state has become todays accepted social mores we all now raise an eyebrow if somebody is drinking when they intend to drive she said ministers could not be as bold now as they were when the drinkdriving laws were introduced to intervene in family life there had to be consensus but there was a danger of nimbyism with people wanting state intervention only when it suited them theresa may the shadow minister for families said at least mrs hodge has admitted what many have been saying for years that the government is intent on interfering and controlling every aspect of our lives she said ms hodges speech confirmed the government was convinced it knew best for britains families whether it is telling you what to eat whether to smoke or drink if you should place a bet or how to look after your own children there is a government minister ready to voice their opinion

the publication of the largest ever survey of preschool education in britain yesterday will provide the foundations for the general election debate about how best to raise the prospects of children from deprived backgrounds margaret hodge the childrens minister will publish a national childcare strategy next week which is expected to become a centrepiece of labours election strategy it will call for a national network of childrens centres providing education and health services for the underfives the idea originated in wellestablished us research showing the positive impact of earlyyears education on childrens lives producing lasting benefits of higher attainment better jobs and lower crime but does the same apply on this side of the atlantic professors from oxford london and nottingham universities began a thorough investigation in tracking more than children from differing social backgrounds through their early years they looked at preschool settings including nurseries playgroups private day nurseries local authority day centres nursery schools and fully integrated centres that provide a range of daily educational and health services from am to pm the integrated centres pioneers of the childrens centres which mrs hodge wants to roll out throughout england performed best they also cost the most averaging a child the researchers found the advantage was not due to long opening hours children attending for halfdays had the same level of attainment as the fulltimers the quality of education provided and the qualifications of the staff it made the difference nursery schools performed well for the same reason disadvantaged children benefited significantly especially if they were in a preschool with children from different social backgrounds the average child of unskilled parents failed to reach the expected reading standard at the age of seven if brought up entirely at home but romped well past it with the benefit of a preschool education indeed the benefits of preschool education were almost as significant in promoting reading attainment at seven as a professional home background but the children of professional parents benefited too by the age of seven those with preschool experience were nearly half way to levels of attainment in reading and maths expected of an yearold their advantage in writing was significant but not quite so pronounced the effective provision of preschool education project found the quality of learning experiences at home was also important teaching nursery rhymes and songs promoted intellectual and social development in all children although parents social class and levels of education affected the childs attainment levels the home learning environment was more important and the effects persisted at seven what parents do is more important than who they are the researchers found but home learning was not enough for the average child and those denied preschool were disadvantaged from the age of two the maximum benefit appeared to be gained by children whose parents were closely involved in the preschool fitting home activities into the development process the researchers intend to track the children to discover whether the advantages of preschool education persist into the later school years professor kathy sylva from oxford university said the impact of coming from a poor family when you are three is greater on your developmental profile than it is when you are five it indicates to us that the preschool has reduced bad effects on childrens developmental profile ms hodge said i

we have now had confirmed what we have long suspected children get a massive head start from quality preschool education and care the effective provision of preschool education study published yesterday tracks children from their early years into school and confirms that their lives are being transformed by positive early experiences these children are already doing much better at school compared to children with no experience of preschool education such evidence is still fairly thin on the ground in the uk but in the us there is a large body of research dating back many years which reinforces these findings there yearolds who have been tracked since they experienced goodquality early years services as toddlers have been shown to be doing much better at work and to be much less likely to be involved in crime or to be a burden on social services the same us study documents a return to society of more than for every tax dollar invested in the early care and education programme next week the government will publish its year strategy for childcare alongside the prebudget report if it is to have a real impact on the disturbing inequality gap in this country the strategy must build on the successes highlighted in yesterdays report to ensure that all families can access affordable quality services the early signs are promising since hundreds of thousands of new childcare and early education places have been created particularly through nurseries integrated childrens centres and outofschool clubs but the last year has seen unparalleled progress twelve months ago no minister would have used the uword now cabinet ministers are competing with each other to lead the drive towards universal childcare this is important too many families now miss out on early education because of market failures which render childcare a postcode lottery so the governments year strategy must face up to the big childcare challenges how to fund affordable sustainable childcare for all how to build a workforce that can deliver quality services for all and how to meet the needs of all families in every community to have any hope of meeting the challenge the strategy must offer a vision of universal childcare early education and parental leave from birth to which really is available to all reflecting our diverse society and meeting the needs of all families and communities all children need the best start in life and all parents need choices about how they balance their family responsibilities with work childcare must be seen as a public good properly funded at levels that match the best in europe not as a private commodity with parents left to the vagaries of the market longterm funding to childcare providers is the key to making services both affordable and sustainable the strategy must invest in a highquality wellpaid workforce with a new childcare professional a pedagogue perhaps trained to work across settings and across ages giving children a rounded upbringing children should be at the centre of a range of integrated services ending the care and education divide the strategy must end the current patchwork of services not just at different times of day but for children of different ages parents must be engaged so services are popular with families a visible part of every community just as schools and gp surgeries are today finally employers must be involved not just through direct childcare support but in making it possible for parents to work flexibly and through longer paid parental leave so both fathers and mothers can share the care of their children only by addressing these issues will the year plan promise hope for families who have waited a long time for childcare services that really meet their needs daycare trust and the social market foundation recently published a study by pricewaterhousecoopers on the costs benefits and funding options for universal early education care and parental leave for all children from birth to the age of it sets out an ambitious package of support and services for children and families to rival the best in europe the report estimates that the longterm benefit to the economy of such a package could be around of gdp per annum the benefits would come from increasing parental employment and boosting the future productivity of children benefiting from highquality early education and care these economic benefits broadly match the total costs of the package to government and parents in addition enhanced integrated early education and care would bring significant social benefits in terms of reduced child poverty and better life chances for all children particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds our modelling is based on the assumption that to make universal childcare affordable parents would on average pay of total costs compared with the of childcare costs they currently contribute the report recommends that the focus of government funding should be on grants to childcare providers rather than through the childcare tax credit this vision aims to provide a genuine choice to all parents about staying at home with their children or going out to work with the

the village nursery is cheerful and calm the decor has been chosen by parents and children the coathooks were selected by thomas four because he says he likes bright blue opened six months ago the place nursery is housed in a strikingly imaginative purposebuilt childrens centre part of a sure start scheme in the grounds of george spurgeon school in one of the less affluent areas of folkestone kent democracy embraces more than the colour scheme what marks this place out is that it is a cooperative mutual society owned and run by the local community michelle rumsey a yearold mother of three is chair of the elected board that oversees the centre she also works parttime as a parent involvement worker ensuring regular contact with every parent in a community that includes more than families some of whom lead lives made chaotic by low incomes and a drug culture parent involvement means exactly that she says we dont just have a couple of token parents who are asked to say yes to everything we genuinely have parents involved in all the decisionmaking at every level and we constantly monitor and evaluate so that we know that the decisions that we are taking are working and supported by the majority cooperative childcare services have long been common in new zealand canada and sweden for parents concerned not just about standards but the values and ethos of the nursery in which their child is being raised it has obvious attractions childcare is an expanding industry but the dangers in relying on the private market have already been exposed while there are excellent exceptions profitmaking and the needs of shareholders often conflict with childrens wellbeing so in the uk its easy to find poorly paid unqualified and demoralised staff showing little interest in what they do so is it really any different at the village the straight answer is yes parents have set charges at an hour fees are subsidised by sure start with the involvement of kent county council shepway district council and the local primary care trust they reflect low incomes average annual salary in the area is and the proportion of parents on benefits factors that are unlikely to attract a private nursery developer to the area basic wages in the nursery however are at least above the minimum in addition all but one of the staff are qualified and all are highly motivated not least because they have a voice in the way in which the nursery is run further training is always on offer profits are ploughed back and the village is growing its own childcare staff parents are taking an nvq in childcare which involves them working in the nursery for several hours a week theresa hughes for example has three children aged eight and four the youngest has just transferred from the nursery to school theresa left school without qualifications but is now taking an nvq at the village she attends a lecture every fortnight and works three afternoons a week with the children it has made me think about how ive brought my own children up she says toni bonnett is the nursery manager she welcomes the constant discussions with parents over the principles of nursery practice professionally this is everything i believe in if parents are involved then standards are raised best practice is established and that really helps to change the profile of childcare for the benefit of the children the belief of the village is that when children transfer to school and a class of what counts most is their confidence and social skills if they lack selfesteem theyll be lost among so many and they wont have the ability to learn bonnett says cooperatives arent easy to establish or sustain in folkestone the challenge was acute deprivation and the fact that local parents lacked expertise and confidence the catalyst has been sylvia scott she became director of the local sure start project three years ago when she arrived she found that much of the planning for childcare provision in the area had been decided by health and education professionals after little consultation she established the childrens centre as a mutual society registered with the financial services authority registration proceeds only if the fsa is satisfied that the society has a social purpose then it enjoys many of the advantages of a registered charity including access to the lottery fund once the structure was in place sylvia and her team set about recruiting help we literally walked the streets asking local people what they wanted would this work or that people were drawn into the childrens centre gradually attracted by a range of onestop shop services and a creche on offer aside from the nursery is backtowork training parenting health and social support including access to psychologists and speech therapists and courses in subjects such as baby massage early learning and play now the timetable is packed organised and initiated by parents who also run a cafe on site which provides food for the nursery were not perfect were not utopia says rumsey we have compliments and complaints we dont see things as right or wrong but as constant opportunities to improve what matters is that we are in

in the primarycoloured nursery at audley and queens park childrens centre in blackburn filled with the smell of eid cakes made by miniature bakers in aprons threeyearold tariq is busy at the building table joining wooden blocks with plastic screws next door in the centres kitchen his mum maherun jogee is cooking meals for visitors to the cafe her first paid job for which she trained in the same building the mix of work training and childcare is just one combination of the impressive range of services available on a single site at audley and queens park one of seven new childrens centres opened in a breathless months by blackburn with darwen borough council with plans for six more under way the judges called this project a clear winner demonstrating joinedup government at its best linking different agencies to improve services for children the onestop centres all also offering outreach services in their surrounding communities form the heart of the unitary authoritys new early years excellence service the approach which preempted the governments own thinking by several years brings together a range of services for children up to five and their families for the first time in the borough bulldozing old walls between education health and social services in an effort to offer truly joinedup provision while local families were once forced to trek between different locations for a child health checkup job advice and training or a library often ending up simply missing out parents like jogee can now find the same facilities and more in one wellequipped either newly built or completely refurbished building close to their home sitting on a mulberrycoloured sofa in the audley and queens park centres vividly painted reception the motherofthree says before this we just didnt have any childcare in this area and because of that nobody could go to work or train so this is ideal i had never had a paid job and i didnt have enough confidence but the staff here supported and helped me like other mothers dropping into the centre she is full of praise for the facilities and opportunities on offer when we come here it is very homely we feel like an accidental family sayeeda mahetar now also in paid work at the centre while her daughter is cared for in the nursery describes how the threeyearold can enjoy facilities including childcare an underfives library and dropin health and child development clinics undreamed of when her older children now aged eight seven and six were preschoolers it was so hard to get on a bus with them all and get to college so there is no way i would be working without the centre the change is down to a new effort to work with families she adds before no one was being listened to but now we are really involved an extensive consultation to discover families real needs was a key part of preparation for the move to the new integrated early years excellence service according to its head gladys rhodes previously she acknowledges services were sometimes provided on the basis of illinformed perceptions of what parents particularly those from the mix of asianheritage communities who make up of the population in some parts of the borough wanted and needed with no effort made to ask the consumers themselves using research already carried out by the five local sure start programmes one of which forms the core of the audley and queens park centre together with more questionnaires and market stalls where parents could give their views the council found the limited availability and high cost of childcare together with the scattered nature of services were key concerns it also emerged that contrary to some preconceptions many mothers were keen to work but were prevented by lack of childcare and the need for training where families are in a cycle of deprivation and poverty there is almost an expectation that they dont know any better whereas actually they bloody well do rhodes says they were not given the choice to have aspiration or ambition the failures in provision were set against a background of high levels of poverty and deprivation in some parts of the borough reflected in poor housing higher than average infant mortality with low takeup of immunisation and child health checks and low educational attainment facilities too were old and unfit one council nursery was originally a cotton nursery established over years ago for the children of millworkers and designed to last only a decade it really felt as though there were huge gaps there says rhodes none of the services joined up for families they had to try and make sense of them themselves the sure start programmes already running in blackburn and darwen reinforced the view that an allinclusive approach provided by a range of agencies working together was the answer that decision though was in some ways the easy part rhodes and her team then had to persuade the authority as a whole as well as other services competing for investment that a focus on early years was the right way forward and then oversee a wholesale change affecting staff the clinching argument for throwing the councils weight and an extra a year towards the services m annual running costs at the youngest children and their families was the capacity to reap longer term dividends by intervening early it was about looking at where we could really make a difference says rhodes we could show people working on youth crime or regeneration that this investment supported what they were doing the process of informing persuading and supporting sometimes wary or reluctant staff was among the toughest challenges in creating the new service it was a gradual process of workshops newsletters and individual interviews for every member of staff rhodes explains we sold it on the basis that families deserved better than we were giving them but there was resistance people felt a real fear of the unknown staff who had always worked with older nursery children were cautious about working with a younger age group for example and those in education had concerns at becoming involved with social services the changeover which has seen every staff member retained on their original terms and conditions is still bedding down but rhodes believes it has succeeded ultimately according to harry catherall the borough councils executive director community and personal the authority took a wellresearched gamble which appears to be more than paying off some of it is scary but the council stuck their neck out and said we will take a risk and establish a network of centres now the government is very interested in what we are doing if ministers want more endorsement they need go no further than the boroughs parents maryam batan a motheroftwo and parent

why does the financial sector have such a poor record on sex discrimination last week a survey conducted by the equal opportunities commission via the magazine personnel today found that in other sectors an average of one in firms had paid an employee to leave when she became pregnant but in the financial sector the average was one in four furthermore the sector also has far more acrimonious settlements than any other industry on average one in firms has been taken to an employment tribunal over pregnancy or maternity leave in finance the average was one in seven when challenged people in finance usually point to the trading floors as the source of the discrepancy there is some justice in the accusation trading is an adrenalinedriven business whose practitioners have little time to spare for other peoples feelings and since the traders earn the profits they often set the cultural tone for their institutions and rise to power within them although it is still maledominated however women are beginning to prevail at the more junior levels overall the finance industry has had a female majority for about years now since the early s when the gender balance changed and female employees at financial institutions outnumbered the male for the first time ever the change came about as highstreet banks introduced shift work and encouraged former employees who had left to have children to return and work the antisocial hours in the city of london a cultural shift is also underway banks are paying more attention to marketing and customer relations career paths are opening up which allow people to climb the executive ladder without having to pass through the trading bearpit meanwhile trading itself is becoming more computerised and less governed by nerve and gut instinct

i used to be in a relationship in which my partner was physically violent to me why did i stay because i loved him and believed him each time he said it wouldnt happen again it was when he started playing with knives that i realised it wouldnt stop there so i left not as easy as it sounds in time i started volunteering for a domestic violence charity supporting women in similar situations through the training i learnt that it wasnt my fault i didnt have a flaw in me that induced violence and the responsibility was per cent his the charity also ran at a different site a perpetrator programme for men who had been violent to their partners due to a lack of funding the mens and womens services had to be merged into the same building i left the charity outraged as i told the women i supported men never change seven years on i work for a project supporting women in hospitals who have experienced abuse and my fear has gone i no longer have to crouch behind a rail of ski jackets in nike when i spot him in the crowd and i no longer think he is trying to get into my flat at night without that fear my attitude to him has softened while i know it was his choice to hit me and it was wise to leave i also know that he learnt his behaviour from a young age and he hated himself for it and i believe if he had wanted it badly enough and there were services for him to access he might have changed my story is not unusual as we all know from the posters showing the man hitting the women in front of their dinner guests domestic violence is rife think of a gathering of of your female friends statistically one of them will be going home to an abusive partner one in four has been assaulted by an intimate at some point every three days one woman in the uk is murdered by her partner or expartner while there are statistics to suggest men are also at the receiving end of domestic violence the overwhelming majority of victims are female in my work i meet women who time and again go back to their partners even when he has told her quite explicitly what will happen when she does its difficult for someone who hasnt made that decision to understand sometimes women do make the break and the partner moves on to the next victim its only a matter of time before another casualty of domestic violence is added to the statistics in the past years societys response to the problem has evolved the police no longer walk away saying its only a domestic courts dedicated to the hearing of domestic violence cases are springing up there is a domestic violence bill going through parliament to make the law more protective the department of health has just announced that midwives must routinely ask every women under their care if they have been abused now society is starting to look at how to change the root of the problem the violence of the perpetrators perpetrator programmes first came to the uk from the us more than years ago now there are in excess of selfreferring groups and the national probation service is in the process of rolling out two accredited perpetrator programmes respect the uk association for perpetrator programmes and associated womens services was launched in by a group of practitioners who felt there should be some guidance for the new work being carried out and to promote good practice in the field it has also just launched a national phone line for perpetrators funded by the home office it offers information and advice to those who are violent or abusive callers get the unequivocal message that violence is unacceptable staff will help calm the perpetrator if he is upset or angry and will encourage him to seek help to stop jo todd director of respect says its not a helpline for men who abuse its an information line to help men start to take responsibility for their violence our priority is always the safety of women and children but do perpetrator programmes work paul wynn from merseyside probation who is is involved in one of the longestrunning programmes says there is evidence to suggest that perpetrators are more successful in stopping violence than if they are just fined or locked up one study showed that of a group of men who attended a perpetrator group per cent didnt reoffend within the time of the study while men who didnt attend a group had a reoffending rate of per cent while these men are ordered by courts to attend the groups men who selfrefer have other motivations rita who works with women who have managed to leave is sceptical of perpetrator programmes she thinks men use the groups to regain power over women ive seen it loads of times women leave the refuge and go back into the violence because hes said hell attend a course after two weeks hes broken his promise and shes stuck there again one of the dangers of running a perpetrator programme is the implicit message that it gives to women that their partner might change this can give women false hope the reality is that the perpetrator programmes work some of the time for some of the men if a woman reading this believes her partner may change if he attends a programme she may make unsafe choices respects view is that perpetrator groups should never be run in isolation they should always have a linked womens support service in this way specialist workers have regular contact with the woman inform her if they feel shes in danger do safety planning with her and manage her expectations for change paul ellis not his real name a teacher from leeds was physically and emotionally violent to his wife for the seven years of their marriage he believes the group he attends has radically altered his behaviour the first time it happened it took me by surprise it was over nothing she had put coloured clothes in with the whites i was furious when she told me to calm down i snapped i pushed her and slapped her face like most perpetrators paul felt guilty after this initial outburst and tried to make it up to his wife by taking her out for a meal i needed her to forgive me so everything could get back to normal but it happened again anything triggered it anything that made me feel she was disrespecting me it was a cycle id abuse her feel bad then try to make it up to her the guilt would fade and something would happen that i wasnt happy about id give her a warning the first few times but id soon be lashing out again paul remembers the time his wifes mobile phone went off when they were shopping when she didnt heed my warning to put the phone down i told her id sort her out later as i drove home i kept thinking i had to get her to show obedience to me in the house i told her to put the bags down settle the children down in front of the tv then i took her into the other room and beat the hell out of her paul was careful not to let the bruises show i knew where to hit her so that people didnt notice it and if she was making too much noise i would put a towel round her face several years into their marriage after regular beatings every few months paul threatened to crash the car if his wife didnt stop the baby crying it was the first time he had directly threatened the children that night she left the house and never returned paul waited three years for his wife and children to come back one day his solicitor suggested a perpetrator programme paul was now in a new relationship with jane and he hadnt told her about his violence he was convinced he had changed but slowly he started to become picky and controlling and decided he had to tell her the truth and seek help for his behaviour jane says i was frightened and shocked how could the lovely gentle man i fell in love with have done this but i had got increasingly worried about his behaviour i was walking on eggshells he asked me to help him change and i said i would if he got help i wanted to give him the chance when he came back from the group he was shocked by what men did to their partners each week he had to report back about his behaviour and slowly it dawned on him that he was behaving the same way as them but jane cautions if a woman is suffering violence she should leave even if he goes on the course only if he proves by his actions that hes changed should she go back paul has proved to me that hes changed hes able to tell me how hes feeling and he no longer blames me for things that go wrong hes not perfect and he still gets angry but now he knows to walk away from the situation and to take time out the group was made up of men from different backgrounds and with different levels of violence they had one thing in common wanting to find another way to relate to their partner it was weird sitting round in a group and saying how vile you had been but it made it real you can no longer deny it if you say it out loud then you have to face what it must have been like for your partner the turning point for me was watching a video of a man beating his wife up i couldnt drive home because i was sobbing so hard paul and jane are now living together and have a oneyearold baby she concludes i love him and want to be with him he wasnt born angry he grew like that because of his life experiences im not excusing his past behaviour but its something to work with i believe that people can change i interviewed another man for this piece he had been through a perpetrator programme and said he had changed i was so alarmed by the way he was still minimising his behaviour and blaming his partner that i decided i couldnt include it it brought home the point that perpetrator programmes are not a fixall solution eleri butler policy and development officer for womens aid says women will not be optimistic about programmes which may lead them to make unsafe choices thats why womens safety work must be at the heart of it women have said that men use their attendance to carry on the abuse to control them in other ways and to justify their behaviour based on what theyve heard other women say womens aid supports perpetrator programmes if they adhere to respects guidelines and if they are treated as part of a multiagency response its not an either or situation theyve got a place in reducing and preventing domestic violence but its just one part of the large picture when i met my ex i fell head over heels in love i thought id found my soulmate while i now know that this is a common phenomenon with men who are controlling and abusive i wonder what would have happened if hed have known where to get help the first time he hit me if hes still hurting the one he loves i hope hes reading this

yesterday a furious fathers rights campaigner handcuffed himself to margaret hodge a citizens arrest he called it just three days earlier the head of the crisisridden child support agency resigned admitting that over the past months the agency charged with collecting child maintenance has made payments to only one in eight single parents most of them mothers it is fitting that both should happen in the same week these two stories of the bungled bureaucratic attempt to make nonresident parents take financial responsibility for their children and of the rise of increasingly militant fathers rights groups have been interwoven for more than a decade when the csa opened in no one was more surprised than the then fiveyearold australian csa theyd known a british csa was on the cards english officials had visited and had returned to london with reams of notes what caused the australians to rub their eyes was not the existence but the design of the british csa it seemed the brits had not only failed to learn from the many positive elements of the australian experience they had done the exact opposite where the australian formula was simple and transparent britains was complicated and obscure where the australians allowed lone parents on benefit to keep more than half the child support paid the uk treasury clawed the lot back where the australians collected money for children only the brits claimed for mothers too where the australians had chosen not to revise existing court settlements the brits had decided to go retrospective in the uk a furore erupted while a relatively moderate divorced dads pressure group families need fathers already existed they had never commanded public attention now faced with the csa a critical mass of men many of whom had been to the right schools and had always assumed the law would be on their side found themselves on the wrong side of an unpredictable apparently irrational badly run bureaucracy they took to the streets and to their mps surgeries fastforward years while the angry dads opposition to the csa in britain has dwindled partly because the agency has been so ineffectual their opposition to the family courts has mushroomed year on year until the separated dads discourse has become the only fatherhood story in town meanwhile on the other side of the world something very different is happening at a glossy dinner in canberra the eightyearsserving chief executive of the australian csa is collecting the australian prime ministers gold award for service excellence international governmentwatchers always caution against transnational comparison they warn that every situation is different and it is true that the potential australian csa clientbase contains fewer poor young unmarried parents than its british equivalent they point out that the australian csa got a rough ride to start with and is still not without its critics nevertheless the australian csas achievements are impressive particularly in comparison with britain it saves its government more money per case than any other countrys even while passing through of all payments directly to children eighty per cent of the australian agencys clients declare themselves either satisfied or very satisfied with the service and in a resounding endorsement of the system of separating australian couples now register with the csa of these more than half end up with private arrangements for the transfer of cash after the agency has calculated the amount private arrangements are the holy grail of child support being associated with greater likelihood of support being paid larger amounts of support being paid greater flexibility over time and benefits in terms of childrens wellbeing and development nor in australia is there a rampant fathers rights movement even though fatherchild contact postseparation is no more substantial than in the uk and fathers when surveyed are no more satisfied with this one reason britains separated fathers make so much fuss outside the system may be that they are neither seen nor heard within it remarkably little research has looked at their experiences and when one report on cohabitation breakdown identified unmarried fathers as doing badly out of the system the foundation that had commissioned the research in effect suppressed the findings by failing to issue a press release separated fathers views are routinely misrepresented government sources imply with a disingenuousness bordering on dishonesty that because of cases never get to court of fathers are satisfied in fact many of these men are very dissatisfied and recently government advisers possibly in an attempt further to discredit the protesters have been citing research they say shows more separated mothers than fathers wanting children to see more of their dads the research method used to obtain these figures is highly unusual whats more they conflict with other findings in the same study and have not been replicated in any other study research from all over the world reveals far more separated fathers than mothers dissatisfied with childfather contact especially where contact levels are low or nonexistent the absence of support for separated dads in the uk is chronic by contrast in australia there is a governmentfunded malededicated helpline mensline and local information and support services to meet the needs of this disaffected group have been given funding priorities the initiatives do not just benefit fathers some innovative pilots fasttrack cases involving allegations of child abuse or domestic violence others look to dissolve intransigent contact disputes through focusing parents attention on their childrens needs the australian government recently pledged considerable resources to develop an holistic approach to family breakdown this will include a national network of communitybased family relationship centres which will siphon off many separating couples long before they get anywhere near a judge but it is in the contrast between the two countries csas that the real gap yawns today the australian agency boasts a culture of voluntary compliance rather than enforcement newlyseparated fathers are targeted before child support arrears build up referrals for help with employment and other issues debtmanagement relationship concerns can be made meanwhile the british csa flails about and like the rest of the system continues to regard separated fathers as nothing more than walking wallets and very unsatisfactory ones at that the select committee were told has recently visited australia again lets hope they get it right this time adrienne burgess is research and policy officer at fathers direct the australian csa will be at fathers

matt oconnor letters november is wrong to say that everincreasing numbers of decent loving fathers are marginalised or excluded altogether from the lives of their children by the family justice system decent loving fathers either manage to agree contact with the childrens mothers without resorting to the legal process or such contact is invariably agreed at or ordered by the court the presumption of contact is so strong that there have to be extremely cogent reasons why the courts would not permit contact to take place a tiny minority of fathers have usually been denied contact because they have been violent or abusive to the child or mother or for such reasons as serious alcoholism or drug misuse which is having a detrimental effect on the child contrary to what fathers justice says research has shown that most mothers make huge efforts to instigate contact and keep it going many contact proceedings are started not by fathers but by mothers who want to regularise arrangements where they are haphazard my own research revealed that whereas all professionals involved expected the mother to make huge efforts to keep contact going practically nothing was expected of fathers apart from arriving on time for visits i do agree there needs to be more transparency about the process im sure that if more details were publicly known about contact cases we might find that many of the cases relating to members of fathers justice involve allegations and in some cases findings against them of serious violence and harassment of the childrens mothers i challenge oconnor to reveal the number of members of fathers justice who have injunctions against them prohibiting violence or harassment of women andor children finally may i take issue with matt oconnors description of fjs campaign as peaceful if there are any repercussions as a result of this letter guardian readers will be the first to know a barnett london when fathers justice begins to acknowledge the significance of domestic violence and its links with child abuse they may start to acquire some credibility indeed all fathers organisations could play a crucial part in high lighting concern about the deaths of children during contact visits the granting of contact and indeed residence orders to men with records of offences against children and the way that the voices of children so often go unheard in family proceedings those who might have some sort of insight into how a childs right to safe contact with both parents is undermined by the inability of so many men to make good relationships with their children should be able to play a more constructive part in the select committee inquiry than inspiring the sort of security that was necessary for our meeting with elizabeth butlersloss and her

corporate sector who would make suitable nonexecutives a management consultant has embarked upon her own attempt to address the situation hilarie owen author of leadership books and founder of the institute of leadership is creating the register of executive and nonexecutive women or renew to provide a headhunting service for large and small british firms she insisted it is not a response to the refusal by ms dandreatyson head of the london business school to draw up the list as suggested by derek higgs in his review of boardrooms which highlighted their white male culture it was clearly in her mind however report after report highlights the low number of women on uk boards were keen to make companies realise that the right director can bring competence skills and experience to a board thereby adding balance to the existing team and strengthening the overall company performance ms owen said a guardian investigation earlier this year of the top companies found that boardroom seats were occupied by women and only were fulltime executives while a report by accountant deloitte found that among the top firms of executive directors are women and of nonexecutives are female just last week the picture in the ftse worsened after the most femalefriendly board in the guardian survey marks amp spencer with four women lost its women executives after a shakeup ms owen plans to launch renew with seminars in london manchester cardiff and glasgow in the coming weeks with a view to creating a network of women who have the potential to go on to boards a few expressions of interest from a handful of women have been received for the register so far she described it as not just a register that she can run as a recruitment firm but also an avenue by which the women can be mentored and developed for the boardroom if her plan works she believes that companies will no longer be able to fall back on the excuse that they would appoint women if only they could find them brian patterson chairman of the irish times and former chief executive of wedgewood pottery is one of renews supporters and will sit on its strong advisory board im against positive discrimination it leads to tokenism as a generality women do bring a different perspective on life on business and on organisations a board that doesnt make use of that is missing something he said the government which commissioned the higgs report after the collapse of enron highlighted deficiencies in boardroom practices in the us has embarked on a number of initiatives to encourage diversity in the workplace the most recent was announced in july when a women and work commission headed by baroness prosser was set up to examine a wide range of issues including the glass ceiling it is scheduled to report to the prime minister by next autumn but only three years ago denise kingsmill the then deputy chairman of the competition commission published a wellreceived review of women at work for the government mrs kingsmill set out a series of aims to help narrow the pay gap and create a mechanism by which companies should be forced to reveal in their annual reports how they treat female employees even so the government is still tackling the issue the dti said patricia hewitt has discussed the role of women in the boardroom with of the heads of the countrys biggest companies in the past year the department has also been in discussions with the headhunters who draw up the shortlists for boardroom positions about the way they approach their task and hinted that an initiative could be on the way fiona

its not often the chancellor offers working parents help with childcare costs but things are looking up for the uks hardworking parents from april gordon brown is extending the childcare voucher scheme to offer working parents income tax relief on the first they earn each week to most people this will be worth a year the only problem is you have to work for a company that has implemented the scheme childcare vouchers are not new its just the way they are taxed that is about to change in his last budget gordon brown announced he was extending their scope to include income tax currently they are restricted to relief on national insurance such plans are known as salary sacrifice schemes and work in exactly the same way as the home computer mobile phone and bicycle initiatives all recently featured in jobs amp money the employer deducts an agreed amount from the employees net earnings which is then passed to the company administrating the voucher schemes on its behalf they in turn provide that employee with vouchers which can be used to pay the registered person or organisation looking after offspring those who now benefit from the scheme dont pay the national insurance on the proportion of their salary they take in vouchers assuming they are standard rate tax payers who pay the average child care costs this saves around a year according to john morton who works for accor services the uks biggest administrator of voucher schemes most basic rate tax payers will be an extra a year better off when the new rules come into force after april basic rate tax payers who take at least of their salary in vouchers will save a year by taking part in a voucher scheme if they are higher rate taxpayers they will save there is no cost to the employee as the admin costs are usually met out of the ni sav ings that the employing company also enjoys he said his company which already offers voucher administration for more than organisations including the treasury and the house of commons is waiting to see how the rules governing nannies will be changed it is intended that vouchers will only be able to be used to pay registered child minders or ofstedregistered nursery schools as well as newlyregulated nannies until now they have been unregulated however the government has said it intends to impose the lightest of regulatory touches to control this important area of the market he said shawn healy tax partner at bdo stoy hayward specialising in salary sacrifice schemes says the most likely beneficiaries will be couples both earning more than until now there hasnt been much takeup among the better paid as there has been little incentive to do so that all changes after april higher taxpayers will be significantly better off and more companies in say the city will be looking at introducing schemes both parents can claim the benefit for the same child on the flipside single parents obviously dont come out of it so well he said sacrificing salary may also affect your entitlement to tax credits several contributionbased benefits such as incapacity benefit rely on minimum ni payments for a small number taking a salary sacrifice scheme may drop them below the threshold similarly maternity allowance is based on your level of income not including earnings sacrificed in this way dummy guide childcare vouchers childcare vouchers effectively let workers swap untaxed income for childcare currently users pay no national insurance on the money they spend on childcare after april they will also get income tax relief vouchers are issued and used to pay the carer or nursery school but its only available to those with participating companies workers spending at least a year on childcare will save a year for higher taxpayers after april but how do they work the employer deducts the money from the workers pay packet and sends it on to the company administering the scheme the employee is then sent a voucher which they can use to pay their childcare provider the nursery or childminder registers with the administering company and sends in the vouchers it has received the admin company pays their value directly into the childcare providers bank account most vouchers schemes are paper based but there are some internetbased evoucher schemes the admin charges are usually picked up by the employees company and are paid for out of the national insurance savings it also enjoys further reading wwwinlandrevenuegovukchildcare or wwwdaycaretrustorgukgt childcare voucher administration companies include wwwaccorservicescouk wwwsodexhopasscouk or

its the biggest financial headache for new parents how to arrange and pay for childcare over the past five years the cost of childcare has risen by and the financial gain for mothers returning to work is becoming negligible this week the conservatives seized the headlines with a manifesto promise that fathers will be able share with their partners a years paid leave from work after the birth of the baby childcare looks set to become a key battleground in the coming election with labour promising that it will give every parent of primary school children access to childcare from dawn till dusk but what if you have a newborn or young child now childminders a childminder provides flexible care in their own home for other peoples children they are selfemployed people who negotiate their own fees and any special arrangements unlike nannies they must be registered under the children act with the office for standards in education ofsted and are regularly inspected childminders are normally paid hourly and rates vary around the country for a fulltime place you should expect to pay between and a week according to daycare trusts latest childcare costs figures youll need to discuss and agree required hours holiday pay and other terms and conditions and ensure that details of these are included in the contract you have with your childminder for further information on childminding and child minding networks you can contact national childminding association at wwwncmaorguk scottish childminding association at wwwchildmindingorg and northern ireland childminding association at wwwnicmaorg advantages generally cheaper than a nursery and may be more convenient for dropping off and collecting children hours are more negotiable and flexible than a nursery disadvantages your child may not enjoy the same social interaction and range of activities offered by a nursery even with registration and regulation many parents remain concerned about the quality of care once the child is dropped off and what happens if the childminder falls ill you have to make other arrangements rather urgently day nurseries these will care for and educate children aged and are usually open all day typically from ampm or pm throughout the year but not evenings and weekends an estimated of the day nurseries in england and wales also provide outofschool care for to yearolds there are different types of nurseries including private community cooperative council and workplace nurseries but all must be registered and inspected by ofsted some childrens centres providing statefunded childcare for children up to the age of five will be upandrunning by a fulltime nursery place for a child under two now costs an average of a week nearly a quarter of the average household income of a week for children aged two and over a place costs on average but parents in some parts of the country particularly london and the southeast pay much more the highest nursery cost identified in daycare trusts latest survey was a week over a year nursery costs can sometimes be subsidised by the local authority or by employers see next page for details the national day nurseries association at wwwndnaorguk offers information and advice to parents advantages the child may be more stimulated and gain from a more structured and schoollikeenvironment wont let you down if someone goes sick councilrun in some areas may be free disadvantages shortages and waiting lists abound access can be a postcode lottery inflexible hours many may shut at pm free nurseries may be halfday only some studies argue there are no social benefits from nurseries and that leaving undertwos in nurseries mean they develop fewer social skills and are less cooperative than if they are looked after by a parent or childminder relatives a third of parents use grandparents other relatives and friends as child carers sometimes in combination with other forms of child care according to a survey published this year by daycare trust this compares with who use day nurseries childminders nursery schools playgroups out of school clubs and just nannies obviously if you have a friend or relative who is willing to provide free or cheap care for your child while you work and whom you trust to do a good job youll jump at the chance perhaps combining their care with playgroup or nursery sessions as your child gets older but if you want to pay them a decent wage for the care they provide there is little financial assistance available a relative who acts as a nanny and provides care for a child in its own home wont be eligible for approval for financial support under the new fasttrack voluntary scheme to be introduced next year the government says it does not think it appropriate to intervene in private family arrangements a friend however could consider going for approval under the scheme one option that has always been open for grandparents and other relatives however is to register as childminders and look after children in their own the carers home this will involve more extensive checks including inspection of their home to see that it meets certain standards but a registered childminder whether or not they are related to the children they care for will be eligible for financial support under both tax credits and employerprovided schemes advantages cheap flexible and you know what youre getting disadvantages can put a strain on family relations and friendships you can only stretch family goodwill so far child may suffer from lack of contact with other children nannies a nanny is someone you employ to care for your children in your own home and therefore can be particularly suitable for working parents who need to be flexible but nannies dont come cheap costing between a week depending on where you live your nannys duties and whether they live with you or live out according to the latest uk nanny wages survey from domestic payroll service nannytax for example a working family in central london paying their daily nanny the average net wage of a week must earn gross just to cover this employment cost nevertheless a nanny may be a cheaper option than say a private nursery if you have more than one preschool child needing care at the moment there is no central registration or regulation of nannies and though many nannies have nursery nurse or other childcare training there is no legal requirement to have even a first aid certificate let alone a professional qualification to date this has excluded parents who use nannies from benefiting from certain forms of financial assistance towards childcare costs the childcare element of the working tax credit and certain employersupported childcare schemes like taxfree childcare vouchers coming in next april for example can only be used to help with the cost of registered childcare such as childminders and nurseries but things are about to change the government is proposing to expand this range of eligible childcare from next april by setting up a fasttrack voluntary scheme under which childcarers like nannies can be approved for financial support to get approval they will need either a recognised childcare qualification or attend a childcare induction course have their criminal records checked and hold a valid first aid certificate if you employ a nanny in the uk and pay them more than a week you have to pay regular income tax and national insurance contributions on your nannys behalf as well as employers nic there are heavy penalties if you fail to to carry out these duties properly one way round this is to offload all your employers responsibilities onto a domestic payroll service like nannytax wwwnannytaxcouk which charges a fixed annual fee of nannytax will however claim back for you

these are testing times in the family courts angry fathers barred from seeing their children throw condoms filled with purple powder at the prime minister and scale the facade of buckingham palace dame elizabeth butlersloss cant even get away from it all at weekends unhappy demonstrators picket her home and heap blame on her and other judges like her for the systems failure to get to grips with the fallout of shattered relationships as president of the high courts family division butlersloss sits at the apex of the family courts which deal with battles a year between divorced and separated parents over their children in her years as a family judge she says the burden of blame has never been so great she wont meet the militant group fathersjustice she told mps at the constitutional affairs select committee this week as long as they persist in hurling condoms and in besieging her devon farmhouse with a double decker bus complete with loudhailer such stunts she has dismissed in the past as jolly irritating but there is an undercurrent of threat which could unsettle someone less robust a website posting accused butlersloss and the other family judges of crimes against humanity and one pickets poster posed the question if bseinfected meat is bad for kids why is this mad cow in charge of family courts the children act was meant to take some of the heat out of parental battles custody and access with their suggestion of prizes to be won or lost became the more neutral residence and contact but words dont change human nature while most parents manage to negotiate a way through the minefield of postdivorce parenting others descend into allout war as one boy told a social worker it is like a war you know they are fighting and they are fighting over me in when dame elizabeth went on the bench many fathers just opted out of the battle and out of their childrens lives the courts too downplayed the role of fathers in one of the few interviews she has given butlersloss admitted in i dont think we recognised the importance of a child having both parents the way we do now my thinking has certainly evolved the important thing for a judge is never to think you know it all the longer i sit the more i feel i have to learn she is unique in having experienced the system from top to bottom her journey began at the age of as a comparatively lowly divorce registrar followed by promotion to high court judge at and later the accolade of first woman in the court of appeal and the first to head a high court division one of the four top judicial posts in england and wales she was born elizabeth havers years ago into an illustrious legal family her father the high court judge who passed the death sentence on ruth ellis the last woman to be hanged in britain her older brother michael father of the actor nigel havers and the qc philip havers who often argues cases before her in court became a tory mp then attorney general and briefly lord chancellor one of a tiny number of senior judges without a university degree she tried to follow her brother to cambridge but failed to get in took a secretarial course and then read for the bar aged she was called to the bar one of only women among barristers a brief detour into politics saw her stand unsuccessfully as a tory candidate for the safe labour seat of vauxhall in a week before the birth of her first child her daughter frances backwater the irony is that she abandoned her career at the bar for her family but ultimately flew at least as high as if shed stayed the course her father warned her she would have to give up all thought of becoming a high court judge if she took what she called a very nice little backwater job in the divorce registry but he said she had a duty to her barrister husband joe and family her unprecedented promotion from the divorce registry to the high court bench came she believes because of her sex the thatcher government and lord hailsham then lord chancellor were keen to promote women she came to public prominence in the late s when she was appointed to chair the inquiry into the cleveland child sex abuse scandal overzealous paediatricians and social workers had taken children into care within weeks on suspicion that their parents had abused them her report which followed her promotion to the court of appeal paved the way for reforms enshrining stronger rights for parents and children and better interdisciplinary cooperation between professionals in the care system listen to the children was a key message in her report children are people not objects of concern she memorably said and any solution to the woes of the family justice system must recognise that children are not packages but people she told mps this week parents must realise this and put their own power battles behind them there must be a widespread culture shift for everyone involved with parents helped to resolve their own disputes through conciliation and the court seen as a place of last resort she and the other judges are owning up to the flaws in the system tackling the delays trying to make sure a single judge gets a grip on each case and that the family court support service monitors whether contact orders are being obeyed and if not gets the case back to court quickly a pilot to teach warring parents about their childrens needs train them in conflict management skills and help them make their own parenting plans holds out hope for the future hamish cameron a child psychiatrist who has argued for years for such changes sees butlersloss as a progressive and reforming judge who is supportive of fathers jim parton of the moderate fathers group families need fathers says i find her byandlarge very fair to deal with i do think shes reformminded judges and lawyers who have worked with her over the years praise her readiness to listen to the voices of children her sympathy with litigants her determination to get to the heart of the issue and her commonsense she is they say someone who keeps an open mind in one case years ago she had written a draft judgment when she insisted on seeing the boy at the heart of the dispute after talking to him she scratched out what she had written saying i wont go against his wishes cameron who first appeared as an expert witness in her court in the s recalls a care case in which butlersloss decided that children should be taken away from their mother outside court afterwards the mother sobbed im not crying because the children have been taken away im crying because the judge really understood and was so nice to me that quality and the firm control butlersloss takes of her cases were evident in the case last month of luke winstonjones the desperately ill baby with a fatal chromosome abnormality whose mother wanted doctors to try to prolong his life the judge insisted on more evidence about what the cardiac massage the mother wanted as a treatment option would mean for the baby the move prompted the nhs trusts treating him to withdraw their application for a declaration that they need not provide it agonising the most agonising lifeordeath cases to reach the family division usually end up in butlerslosss court she was particularly moved by the plight of ms b a senior social worker left quadriplegic after a blood vessel burst in her neck who eloquently argued for the right to have her life support switched off butlersloss who heard the case at ms bs hospital bedside granted her wish but urged her unsuccessfully to reconsider because she had so much to give at the root of butlerslosss willingness to listen is a strong belief in personal autonomy after a series of cases in the s in which family division judges ruled that doctors could force pregnant mothers to undergo caesareans to save their unborn babies she clamped down and ruled that women who were mentally competent had a right to refuse even at the risk of their own or their babies lives richard gordon qc who represented the woman who won the ruling says of butlersloss anybody doing a right to life or right to die case absolutely knows that shell give that case totally fair and objective consideration shes a very handson judge she has a very clear grasp of the issues that shes deciding shes also a very humane judge what she isnt is a hardedged lawyer life in short born

tony blair and michael howard were battling today for the young parents vote with rival promises to improve childcare mr howard the tory leader announced that a conservative government would offer parents greater flexibility in how they could claim maternity benefits the conservatives would offer new mothers concentrated maternity payments so they would receive more each week about compared with the current but over a shorter length of time meanwhile the prime minister promised that a reelected labour government would offer all parents of primary school children affordable childcare in schools from am to pm he said money had already been set aside to ensure schools could offer breakfast clubs in the morning and afterschool clubs in the evening speaking at the annual conference of the daycare trust charity in central london mr blair said radical change was needed to put an end to the era of latchkey kids he said twothirds of mothers now worked and a quarter of children lived in a loneparent family but his governments plans would progress towards universal childcare mr blair said over the next parliament every parent with children in a primary school will be offered the guarantee of affordable school day childcare from am to pm from breakfast clubs in the morning to afterschool clubs in the evening and not just during term time but all the year round he said that at least half of all parents would enjoy this service in the coming years and by at least a third of secondary schools will be extended schools open for hours flexibility from the conservatives outlining his plans at conservative central office in london mr howard described the current level of maternity pay as often not enough to enable women who want to stay at home to do so and promised more flexibility for parents he said a conservative government would allow mothers to claim what they would receive over a year over a shorter period or let fathers claim the money instead mr howard said his partys reasoning was that the early months after a new birth were often the ones when parents felt under the most pressure financially and when relationships were at greatest risk of breaking down if the government goes ahead with extending from six to months the current entitlement to maternity pay the tories would offer mothers the option to receive a bigger payment over six months according to a party spokeswoman media reports had claimed the tories would offer a week maternity pay but today they would not commit to any figures mr blair said it would cost the government an extra bn a year to pay mothers a week to stay at home for a year the department for education and skills said that it had not ruled out extending maternity to pay from six to months but there were no plans to do so the tories are also offering to allow fathers rather than mothers to claim the maternity pay the proposals would not cost any more money but parents would have more flexibility the tory spokeswoman said election battleground mr howards announcement coming ahead of the prime ministers unveiling of government plans for enhanced childcare at schools represent a tory challenge to labours appeal to working parents labours election chief alan milburn attacked the tory plans for failing to live up to their billing in this mornings papers tory policy has descended into complete disarray he said adding that the partys proposals on childcare had completely unravelled earlier mr blair visited a breakfast club at millfields community school in hackney east london he said of his scheme the school day does not necessarily fit the parents working day so if both parents are working it is a real stress and struggle for them this is a chance to give them childcare throughout the day in the proper way phil willis the liberal democrat education spokesman said it makes sense to get maximum use out of school facilities and to keep children in a single secure place throughout the day but by missing out on essential details the government is at risk of spoiling a good idea parents must have peace of mind that their children are receiving highquality childcare by properly vetted staff teachers must be informed about how it will affect their work conditions and so far nobody has told schools whether they are expected to pay for this in his speech mr howard also tried to outflank the government by offering more flexibility on childcare payments announcing proposals that would mean the money going directly to parents he said at present the bureaucratic childcare tax credit could only be spent on formal registered care yet half of all childcare was informal mr howard said that under his plans parents could spend the money on the childcare they want not the childcare ministers think is best he said it might be an au pair or even family and friends,2004-11,tony blair michael howard battling today young parent vote rival promise improve childcare mr howard tory leader

traditional conservative thinking that mothers should stay unpaid at home with their children has been banished forever according to the partys shadow secretary of state for the family in an interview with the guardian theresa may instead outlined her aim to provide choice and flexibility for parents she acknowledged that a new recognition in the party that financial circumstances frequently compel both parents to go out to work and that the state should provide some help with childcare costs was opposed by some grassroots members but she insisted that measures intended to support working parents but also those who choose to be at home for their childrens first year outlined today are strongly supported by the tory leadership and would form a key part of the partys election manifesto as it seeks to counter labours supremacy on childcare issues she said the conservative party has always been the party where it is assumed that we would always be saying to mothers thou shalt sit at home we are not we are saying this is about choice for families the nature of the partys ageing membership made it inevitable that there will be those who lived their lives in a different way and will say we didnt need it childcare help why should anybody else mrs may who was appointed to her newlycreated post within the shadow cabinet in june by tory leader michael howard made clear her view that the conservatives were easily outshone by labour on childcare at the election the creation of a family policy will help the tories convince voters they are in touch with the bread and butter issues that matter to them party strategists believe the conservatives face a tough political challenge however since a battery of reforms have included the creation of childcare places for more than a million children and nursery education places for all three and fouryearolds the introduction of a tax credit to help pay for childcare the establishment of the sure start programme to sup port families in poorer areas and the creation of new childrens centres bringing together childcare healthcare and parental support under its fiveyear plan for education announced in july the government has also promised to introduce in every community an extended school offering care from pm to pm and a childrens centre with more details to be set out in a year childcare strategy expected later this month the conservatives believe they can offer a distinct alternative that meets needs while responding to perceived weaknesses in current policy which they argue offers topdown inflexible solutions mrs may believes the tax credit system designed to help parents pay for britains expensive childcare has proved bureaucratic and complicated the conservatives promise to simplify it and allow parents to use the money for informal care including relatives for the first time the conservatives have promised to keep sure start if elected but are concerned that the scheme sucks staff away from surrounding childcare providers and plan a review prompting suspicions that they would neuter the governments flagship programme mrs may also argues that extended schools may not be the universal answer for childcare saying such services are already running well in churches or other settings in some parts of the country the conservatives she said would take a more handsoff approach leaving more scope for private and voluntary providers the conservative plan will include moves to encourage more grandparents to qualify as childminders which would lead to an emphasis on socialisation many parents are concerned that as the government pilots nursery places for twoyearolds their children are being pushed into education too soon mrs may argues critics of the more marketdriven approach favoured by the conservatives will raise fears that without a governmentled strategy the dream of a nationwide childcare system comparable with those on the continent will never become reality they are also concerned that any move to cut regulation as a means of encouraging expansion could lead to a drop in quality,2004-11,traditional conservative thinking mother stay unpaid home child ha

the government is preparing to publish a year strategy for childcare in which for the first time a proposal for its longterm direction will be spelt out new labour has made no secret of the fact that the destination should be goodquality affordable childcare for all who want it in britain universal childcare is one of the few frontiers of the welfare state left to navigate in this respect we have lagged behind other industrialised countries we are some years behind scandinavia which foresaw the challenges presented by more women entering the workforce and took measures to ensure that children were not forgotten amid rapid labour market changes countries from new zealand to the netherlands have also rethought their childcare systems what lessons can we learn from them what does good early years provision look like and how can it best be funded attempts to define goodquality childcare usually rely on quantifiable indicators such as staffchild ratios however experience from other countries suggests that we might do better to reflect on the totality of a childs experience and that the best early years services are based on a childcentred understanding of education one place stands out as offering a standard against which all others can be measured it is not a country but a city young childrens services in the italian city of reggio emilia and the pedagogical theory on which they are based have a worldwide reputation what takes place in the or so centres that cater for children under the age of six in reggio emilia couldnt be laid down in a curriculum or instruction manual their approach is informed by an image of the child not as an empty vessel into which the right ingredients must be poured but as a being with extraordinary potential great emphasis is placed on encouraging curiosity and innovation with both children and teachers engaged in a constant process of discovery the child is not seen as a passive recipient of education or care but as an active participant staff are confident and articulate and parents are encouraged to be involved the outcomes are neither predeterminable nor necessarily measurable but countless testimonies suggest they offer children the strongest foundation for life could such an approach be adopted here the childcare debate in britain focuses on the perceived need to improve early years curricula or to tighten regulation but compared to other countries britain already has some of the toughest regulations we have chosen to go down the route of inspecting out poor quality rather than investing in a highly trained workforce that can be depended on to deliver optimal experiences for children differences in qualification levels speak for themselves to become a danish pedagogue requires three to four years of higher education training most british childcare workers are not required to have passed an alevel and few senior staff hold a degree one thing is certain quality costs no country has managed to develop goodquality childcare paid for entirely out of parents pockets deciding how the costs should be shared is a matter for each society to judge since the s dutch policy has been for childcare costs to be split equally between parents employers and state this tripartite model was born out of a tradition of strong social contracts embodied in collective labour agreements a history that britain does not fully share in denmark federal law prohibits local authorities from charging parents more than of the cost of a childcare place each local authority is allowed to set charges according to parents means within this overall limit sweden by contrast has defined affordability in relation to the proportion of income that parents can be expected to contribute the maximum fee that parents pay is of their income for their first child reduced for subsequent children this would be equivalent to charging parents per child per week a massive reduction on britains typical childcare weekly costs of around but it has taken sweden more than years to get to this point and this level of affordability is unlikely to be achieved in britain within years nevertheless closing the gap between what british parents and their continental neighbours pay must surely be a priority finally what can be learned about building a consensus on an approach to the early years in scandinavia there is such strong public support for investing in childcare that any proposal to reduce the states contribution would be deemed political suicide we are long way from that new zealand whose childcare tradition has been similar to our own perhaps offers more relevant lessons the government there has recently embarked on a year plan to improve the quality of its childcare provision by investing in workforce reform a commitment has been made to achieve a teachertrained workforce by the level of ambition is impressive and it has been matched by an approach to policymaking that is likely to ensure its childcare reforms will not become a casualty of any future political changes the year plan was drawn up following extensive public consultation here too widespread public support

englands top family law judge yesterday castigated the militant fathers group fathersjustice and said she would refuse to meet them while they persisted in highprofile stunts and demonstrations targeting judges homes dame elizabeth butlersloss the president of the family division of the high court criticised the group whose members climbed the walls of buckingham palace and threw flour bombs at tony blair in the house of commons she said their protests were not sensible and acted against a constructive dialogue between judges and aggrieved fathers who claim the family justice system denies them a fair deal in court battles over contact with their children she was giving evidence with mr justice munby and lord justice wall to the commons constitutional affairs committee which is looking into the reform of the family court system dame elizabeth denied the system was biased against fathers while conceding in written evidence to the committee chaired by the liberal democrat mp alan beith that the present system is open to criticism much of it wellfounded the judge said she had met fathers support groups such as families need fathers and fathers direct and had positive discussions about their cause but she added i cannot meet fathersjustice because they are not being sensible and as long as they throw condoms with purple powder and send a doubledecker bus with a loudspeaker outside my private house in the west country there is no point they are not going to talk they are going to tell me matt oconnor founder of fathersjustice said i am just dumbfounded by a lot of what was said i just think the judges have lost their marbles they are completely out of touch with what i see going on in the courts as a person in litigation the labour mp keith vaz asked whether it was a failure of government that the family court system was receiving such criticism and if judges were being unfairly blamed dame elizabeth replied the judges are being unfairly burdened we are bearing quite an interesting burden of blame i do not think it is the fault of the politicians politicians cannot make the parties be sensible in their oral and written evidence the judges said the systems failings included delays caused by a shortage of judges and the competing pressures of local authority care cases other problems were difficulties in having the same judge see the case through from start to finish lack of resources for mediation counselling and mental health help for problem families and the few options available to make recalcitrant mothers comply with contact orders dame elizabeth and mr justice munby signalled the possibility that family courts where almost all cases are heard behind closed doors could be opened more widely mr justice munby said the reporting of onesided stories without the full facts was doing us serious harm and i dont think the existing rules are necessary,2004-11,england top family law judge yesterday castigated militant

this is amnesty international will readily admit far from its usual realm of campaign work bright posters show women who initially look upbeat and fresh smiling in what appears to be an advertisement for a new cosmetic but a closer look reveals they nurse bruises circling their eyes scars under their breasts and cut cheeks the series of posters carry the tagline for bruising relationships and the human rights organisation says the campaign is designed to confront men and tackle complacency after discussions with victims amnesty said it felt there was a need to use more daring domestic violence campaigns nick barham of advertising agency karmarama said the focus groups showed an alarming level of acceptance and the idea was to move away from the cliches of campaign advertising the angry perpetrator and the upset victim we wanted people to feel disturbed by it he said the posters which will appear in underground stations from today will feature in mens magazines in the new year kate allen amnesty international uk director said research shows a common reaction to the issue of domestic violence is to ask problem what problem we are saying lets wake up to the epidemic of domestic violence in this country and really press for a concerted government strategy that addresses all aspects of violence against women the extent of domestic violence in the uk is not known but surveys suggest there are more than half a million incidents in england and wales every year on average two women are killed in domestic violence incidents every week an icm survey last year revealed more people would report a person for kicking or mistreating their dog than for kicking or mistreating their partner sandra horley the chief executive of the womens group refuge said domestic violence is

you state stand up for your rights minister tells fathers october that the socalled split for contact with children between separating parents as advocated by fathersjustice is backed by the conservatives this is not the case conservatives support a legal presumption of coparenting we believe the best parent for any child is both parents and that both assuming they are fit and proper should be fully involved in the upbringing and development of their child we recognise that government should not prescriptively dictate that a child should be split down the middle but we are convinced that it is impossible for a loving bond to be formed without quality parenting time that is why we believe that parents should have the right to have contact with their children enshrined in law we also believe that without clear guidelines and a greater use of mediation families will continue to suffer the misery of years in the family courts to get too little contact with the children they love as part of a radical overhaul of the family justice system we are proposing to establish proper guidelines so that parents understand what the courts expect of them coupled with early mediation the courts should be the last not the first resort our country deserves a better system of family justice one that is open fair and accountable theresa may mp shadow secretary of state for the family,2004-11,state stand right minister tell father october socalled split contact child separating parent advocated fathersjustice backed conservative case conservative support legal presumption coparenting believe best parent child parent assuming fit proper fully involved upbringing development child recognise government prescriptively dictate child split middle convinced impossible loving bond formed without quality parenting time believe parent right contact child enshrined law also believe without clear guideline greater use mediation family continue suffer misery year family court get little contact child love part radical overhaul family justice system proposing establish proper guideline parent understand court expect coupled early mediation court last first resort country deserves better system family justice one open fair accountable theresa may mp shadow secretary state family,"['state', 'stand', 'right', 'minister', 'tell', 'father', 'october', 'socalled', 'split', 'contact', 'child', 'separating', 'parent', 'advocated', 'fathersjustice', 'backed', 'conservative', 'case', 'conservative', 'support', 'legal', 'presumption', 'coparenting', 'believe', 'best', 'parent', 'child', 'parent', 'assuming', 'fit', 'proper', 'fully', 'involved', 'upbringing', 'development', 'child', 'recognise', 'government', 'prescriptively', 'dictate', 'child', 'split', 'middle', 'convinced', 'impossible', 'loving', 'bond', 'formed', 'without', 'quality', 'parenting', 'time', 'believe', 'parent', 'right', 'contact', 'child', 'enshrined', 'law', 'also', 'believe', 'without', 'clear', 'guideline', 'greater', 'use', 'mediation', 'family', 'continue', 'suffer', 'misery', 'year', 'family', 'court', 'get', 'little', 'contact', 'child', 'love', 'part', 'radical', 'overhaul', 'family', 'justice', 'system', 'proposing', 'establish', 'proper', 'guideline', 'parent', 'understand', 'court', 'expect', 'coupled', 'early', 'mediation', 'court', 'last', 'first', 'resort', 'country', 'deserves', 'better', 'system', 'family', 'justice', 'one', 'open', 'fair', 'accountable', 'theresa', 'may', 'mp', 'shadow', 'secretary', 'state', 'family']",161
scotland yard wants new laws to force doctors social workers and other professionals to report incidents of domestic violence the move follows research commissioned by the metropolitan police into abuse in the home it showed that in the runup to domestic murders health workers housing officers and others often knew about previous assaults but this information was not shared and the victims suffered a final fatal attack the yard proposal would make it mandatory for professionals aware of such incidents to inform a new risk assessment panel commander brian moore responsible for tackling domestic violence in london explained that multiagency protection panels already monitor the countrys most dangerous people not only sex offenders but mentally ill people with a propensity for violence the bichard report examined how information and intelligence about alleged offenders could be better shared between police forces and other agencies following revelations about the history of sexual allegations against ian huntley the soham murderer but the new risk assessment panel would deal specifically with those committing domestic violence mr moore said this is about protecting people mainly women who may start as victims of violence but can end as victims of murder when we look at some of these cases after the event we find family members neighbours and a raft of professionals all knew what was going on but that information was not analysed or acted upon the department of health is already planning to introduce a policy next year to get doctors and midwives to ask all pregnant women if their partners have ever attacked them but mr moore said even more comprehensive monitoring was necessary we need a statutory regulation to make it mandatory for indications of domestic abuse to be passed on to local panels who will assess it and decide what action needs to be taken some people could be concerned that the victim might not choose to report incidents if the police were to get to hear about it but our research indicates thats not the case the human rights of the perpetrator are outweighed by the human rights of the victim the new panels assessment could lead to swift police action to deal with the most dangerous offenders or anger management therapy for others and timely help for victims but barry hugill director of the civil rights group liberty sounded a note of caution we are in favour of any measure that can help reduce domestic violence he said but once you start trying to collect information and allegations on everyone not only is it a bureaucratic nightmare but what do you do with it you cant prosecute someone unless theyve committed an offence and where there are breakdowns of relationships there are often false allegations would this reduce domestic violence i dont know but it could lead to innocent people being harassed however philippa sully a senior lecturer in interprofessional practice at londons city university who conducted an analysis of five domestic murders for the met insisted that early intervention saved lives she found that in all the cases the violence in the relationships was known about in the family

a civil servant accused of raping a woman in a government office walked free from the old bailey yesterday after the case against him collapsed when the alleged victim was unable to continue her evidence michael burrell a department of constitutional affairs employeesaid in a statement i am relieved that my month ordeal is now over i feel that justice has finally been done and i have been publicly vindicated mr justice aikens threw out the case finding him not guilty of indecent assault and sexual assault yesterday after the trial was halted this month when the woman was taken ill mr burrell was accused of raping the yearold senior civil servant but he claims the sex which took place after an informal office gettogether was consensual and that she wanted me to be rough with her the prosecution had alleged that mr burrell manoeuvred the woman to a sofa in a private office where he raped her twice and forced her to perform oral sex a doctor said that abrasions she suffered were consistent with nonconsensual sex the court heard evidence of how the woman had felt increasingly uncomfortable in burrells presence as he would hang around her colleagues referred to him as aggressive mr burrell claimed that the woman was the instigator throughout and had expressed her loneliness and need for comfort to him on the second day of her cross examination the alleged victim who had been giving evidence behind a screen and could not see mr burrell said she was ill and could not continue when elizabeth marsh qc defending pointed out that burrell had not been equipped with any weapon the woman said she was so scared because it took me back to how i felt as a child when i was abused and felt utterly powerless and degraded the following day the jury was told she had been taken ill a forensic medical examiner said the woman was unfit to give evidence and may pose a suicide risk given her mental health problems and past history of sexual abuse mr justice aikens said the defence case and crossexamination of the alleged victim had been fair you conducted your crossexamination in a perfectly proper manner with care discretion and sensitivity he told ms marsh i do not wish it to be thought it was anything on your part that led to the discontinuation of the case the woman later made a statement saying she was unable to face a retrial the experience of giving evidence and crossexamination made me feel ill too ill to continue during the trial she said i have no reason to believe that i would not find another trial at least as traumatic i do not wish to make myself feel ill and do not wish to continue i understand this means the defendant will be acquitted the crown prosecution service said yesterday there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction but after much discussion decided that continuing the trial would be detrimental to the womans health only of all recorded rapes reach convictions at a crown court according to recent figures two years ago it was revealed that rape prosecutions are dropped every year angie conroy of the survivors trust said one of the things that always strikes me is how long it takes for the case to get to court with this case it happened in september and it has taken months to get to court going through the process your biggest fear is that you wont be believed then you have to be forensically examined then wait months to see if your case will come to court mr burrell was yesterday awarded in court costs a spokeswoman for the department for constitutional affairs said his

nineteen seventytwo was a good year for jonathan gathorneharvey to publish the rise and fall of the british nanny at the time it seemed reasonable to write that the institution and the unnatural relationships it bred were dying winston churchill had far greater feelings of tenderness to his nanny everest than his parents she adored him and called him my lamb when she died churchill said she had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the years i had lived gathorneharvey looked back on the heyday of the nanny in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and wrote that it wasnt exceptional to find forlorn love the annals of nanny literature are filled with desperate and brutal partings as carer and child were pulled apart by market forces or parental whims by the early s the world in which nannies would shout there are three sorts of sin little sins bigger sins and taking off your shoes without undoing the laces at the children of english upper and uppermiddle classes seemed as dead as the empire the second wave of feminism had yet to roar in and middleclass women brought up their own children the high rates of taxation of the postwar social democratic settlement meant that only families at the top could afford to contract out childcare few workingclass women wanted to lose their independence by becoming livein servants and wouldnt have taken the jobs if they had been on offer a glimpse of a nanny pushing a pram was as rare as the sight of a beggar on the streets today it is the financially egalitarian but sexist s which seems strange the professional couple who draw high salaries throughout their careers has become an engine which wrenches the classes apart the woman and by extension her partner rely on equality between the sexes enforced by equal pay acts antidiscrimination legislation but as sexual inequality has declined inequalities of wealth have shot up and nannies are everywhere keeping the professional marriage in business from john profumo through to david mellor public careers used to be destroyed by scandals about private life it is a sign of the times that the privatisation of private life can now do for them just as well when american activists want to stop the president from giving a plum job to someone they despise they know the best place to start digging for dirt is in his or her childcare arrangements theres a fair chance that they will find wretched ille gal immigrants paid in cash to keep the arrangement away from the prying eyes of the tax authorities the latest victim of the black economy of the wealthy family is bernard kerik a former new york police commissioner who george w bush wanted as his new secretary for homeland security even by the standards of the bush presidency kerik wasnt a shrewd choice the new york papers claimed that the married man had affairs in a flat overlooking ground zero and accepted money from a construction firm alleged to be linked to the mob but it was the nanny who got him he withdrew his candidacy when he had to admit he hadnt checked her immigration status or paid taxes on her wages david blunkett didnt fall because he slept with a dazzlingly cynical married woman but because of the favourable treatment the home office gave her nannys visa application kimberly fortier or quinn as she now calls herself wangled the favour out of blunkett and used his willingness to succumb to destroy him when their affection turned sour everyone agrees that the nanny is at the centre the affair yet she has been barely discussed like many another servant she has been at once essential and invisible her superiors have talked through her as if she wasnt in the room its a pity because it is through leoncia casalme that a local scandal connects to the global scandal of the free market in love casalme is from the philippines and an unasked question is why on earth didnt kimberly fortier and stephen quinn hire a british nanny they could afford one she was the publisher of the spectator and he the publisher of vogue they lived in a million house in mayfair the habitual meanness of the rich could explain it fortier didnt want the passport to make her nannys life better but so she could look after her child when the family travelled to quinns home in ireland but stinginess may not be the whole story casalme gave a stronger lead in an interview with the mail kimberly quinn is the only person i have ever worked for who has made me cry she said she is a loving mother but also a very pushy woman what she wants she has to get and if she doesnt get it she starts yelling and shouting you cant reduce a british nanny to tears too often and hold on to her they have to put up with a lot domestic service is once again work they can and often must do gordon browns employment and benefit policies are based on the notion that mothers from humble backgrounds should leave their children to look after other peoples children its a tough life but as a friend from one of the smarter london postal districts put it to me there are lots of things they wont do they wont cook and clean if theyre not paid to cook and clean and they wont be bullied third world servants are another matter a tradeunion organisers nightmare they are cheaper and more pliable and dont know how to ask for the protection of the law because they live under their employers roof it is all but impossible for outsiders to talk to and help them every now and again charities and pressure groups succeed and manage to break sensational accounts of rape and violence more typical are the stories like that of a filipino nanny ive come across who teeters on the edge of a kind of serfdom first she worked for a middle eastern family in london they locked her in her bedroom at night and searched her when she left the house to make sure she hadnt stolen the spoons she escaped and found what she took to be a progressive young english woman in chelsea the civilised appearance was an illusion she was harried and abused a drop of water on ludicrously impractical teak kitchen surface produced a tantrum a failure to obey the most trivial command produced a screaming fit the nanny was close to a nervous breakdown when she said she wanted to leave her mistress said she would shop her to the home office as an illegal immigrant if she dared defy her she got out anyway and hasnt been pickedup yet she was a small part of a global phenomenon half the worlds migrants are now women they look after the children sick and old of the developed countries while the children sick and old of their own countries fend for themselves earlier this year the american journalist barbara ehrenreich edited nannies maids and sex workers in the new econ omy which rubbed in the sore point that the feminism of the s would have been broken by the insoluble problem of how to combine career and family if domestic servitude hadnt been neatly passed from one group of women to another the book contained many a heartbreaking account of modern nanny everests filipino nannies who leave the children they love behind and fall in love with their temporary charges while their male and female employers liberate themselves from drudgery such uncomfortable reading drew an indignant response critics complained that many maids and nannies were wellpaid and welltreated which is true others said that women were made to feel guilty whatever they did and thats undeniable too in the s when women stayed at home they were accused of lavishing smother love on their sons and turning them into schizophrenics psychopaths or worse homosexuals but the strongest reaction was amused condescension ehrenreich and her colleagues were raging against an economic order which couldnt be changed but just as the order of the s seemed natural to jonathan gathorneharvey so our assumptions will one day seem bizarre while we wait for change it would be good if the constant demands for better childcare could be complemented by demands for better protection for the women who do the childcare and for the leoncia casalmes to at least be recognised as a

its official penguin is the uks top employer for parents on friday the company was awarded the nspcc family friendly employer of the year award beating other finalists accenture loop customer management westfield health scheme and boroughs partnership nhs trust among penguins array of familyfriendly measures are excellent maternity provision generous childcare subsidies and the right for all staff to request flexible working employees are also entitled to days compassionate leave for days when children or parents get sick and they have access to a parents forum which provides mutual support network most importantly for martin dunford the publishing director of the rough guides penguin encourages new dads to take four weeks paid paternity leave it makes a huge difference when your child is born to be able to spend quality time with them he says in fact it seems incredible to me that for many people and not so long ago for everyone theres an expectation to return to work the next day while some of penguins policies are new the family friendly culture is not insists susan taylor hr director at penguin group uk it all started years ago when penguin was founded the company wanted to attract and retain the best people and saw an opportunity to achieve this through providing genuine opportunities for worklife balance the benefits are huge she says parents and kids get to spend more time together not just when they are small but for special events like concerts sports activities medical checks or when they are ill meanwhile we have great staff retention improved customer relations low absenteeism and improved productivity operations manager roz hitchcock is one of the of women at penguin who return to work after maternity leave having taken six months fully paid maternity leave and a further months unpaid after my first baby i asked to move parttime and shortly afterwards got a promotion she says i then took maternity leave for my second child and again theres a feeling that if i wanted to change my hours i probably could coming a close second at fridays award ceremony was boroughs partnership nhs trust which was highly commended by the nspcc like other nhs trusts boroughs offers employees a wide range of flexible working options but more uniquely it has set up an older childrens school holiday activity scheme to support childcare provision for to yearolds this agegroup often see themselves as being too old for childcare points out gail nicholas worklife balance manager at the trust but in regular feedback they have been exceptionally positive about the scheme we find that some staff only need to use the service which is available from am to pm for a few hours a day but young people ask if they can come for longer she says one parent was asked by her child not to take any leave during the holidays which was about the best feedback i could get particularly considering the original resistance of some of the young people all activities are planned in partnership with the young people to ensure that they are varied and focus on their interests recent examples include canoeing rock climbing and an olympic week ms nicholas says parents no longer have to worry about their offspring while theyre at work and the trust as well as its patients benefit from happier more motivated staff i see the scheme as a longterm recruitment tool too she adds these young people are at the age when theyre considering career options and we are able to offer them work experience opportunities detailed consultation with employees is the key to introducing the right initiatives according to loop customer management one of the finalists for the award as a result the company now provides flexible working options including termtime working as well as grandparents leave and life opportunity leave which enables people to take a break when something special comes up such as starting a family or going on a major trip its also important to listen to individual requests loop believes one employee whose son secured a place on a wellknown premiership youth football team changed her hours so that she could take him across the pennines in the afternoons for training sessions with probably one of the bestknown clubs in the world meanwhile at westfield health scheme another of the finalists familyfriendly measures include

also points to accenture allows staff to work from home on fridays as well as offering support with childcare expenses and working parent seminars the shortlisted employers are inspiring examples of how familyfriendly work practices not only benefit working parents but also make good business sense says charlie monkcom the nspccs employment policy adviser if recent research is anything to go by the bigger picture is not so positive however the equal opportunities commission recently found that more than four in uk workers are unaware that parents have the right to request flexible working they also found that almost of those who know what their rights are felt sure that any request would be turned down but rebecca clake adviser at the chartered institute of personnel and development believes this is misleading one of our studies found that the vast majority of requests are accepted indicating that peoples assumptions may be wrong she says there is every reason to believe from our

primaries we are at the forefront of creating a truly meritbased level playingfield unlike those of labour these measures do not patronise women through compulsory shortlists a number of associations have chosen to have allwomen finals without the need for us to impose them the first primary was won by a woman other developments include a partnership with associations which has radically changed selections in some cities and shown how by working together we can achieve a more balanced and representative field in birmingham our team of six includes three women and three men from ethnic

hundreds of thousands of families could benefit from a government move to extend childcare tax breaks to help working parents pay for nannies childrens minister margaret hodge said yesterday from april next year families earning up to a year will be able to claim financial support worth up to a week for childcare in their own home providing the carer is registered under a new childcare approval scheme at present the cash help paid as part of the working tax credit is only available for childcare outside the home in nurseries or with childminders leaving many families whose working hours require different kinds of care excluded from the benefit ministers at first resisted paying towards nannies and au pairs amid concerns over how to guarantee quality but they have now opted to introduce a light touch scheme which means carers need only pass police checks gain a first aid certificate and complete a hour induction course if they have no relevant childcare qualification in order to join an approved register ms hodge stressed it would still be up to parents to vet carers coming to their home to look after children there will be no cash support for relatives such as grandparents who look after children although that is the preferred choice of many parents amid government concern not to subsidise existing free arrangements the new nanny tax break coming into force around a month before the expected general election represents an attempt by ministers to ensure moves to improve britains inadequate childcare provisions include universal benefits as well as highly targeted initiatives focused on deprived areas the government is conscious that its much heralded year childcare strategy published last week must be seen to offer a better deal for all parents if claims of a new family friendly welfare state are to be justified speaking during the sure start annual conference in london ms hodge said the strategy was nothing short of a childcare revolution the government did not know how many families would take up the tax break for childcare in the home she said but predicted hundreds of thousands would benefit while cash for nannies will be viewed by some as a preelection windfall for the middle classes childcare in the home is also frequently the only choice for shift workers unable to fit around standard nursery hours anne longfield of the childcare campaign group children said there is a real need for this help among hundreds of thousands of parents but in the past they have just clunked around the system parents want childcare in the home because they feel more secure they dont want to move their children around and they cant find care outside that fits in with their hours the childcare approval scheme will effectively create a register of accredited carers for whom parents can claim tax breaks nannies who must be over will have to pay every year to join the scheme being administered by nestor primecare services a private health and social care employment agency it is expected that many parents will end up paying the fee themselves the tax break scheme will be operated by the inland revenue which yesterday said it would conduct spot checks to ensure childcare was really taking place to prevent fraudulent claims what is on offer and who gets it what is on offer cash help towards the cost of childcare in your own home until now the money could only go towards nursery or childminder fees there will also be help for childminding for over sevenyearolds for the first time who qualifies parents eligible for the childcare element of the working tax credit that means families where both parents are working or a lone parent and earning up to a year from april families with two or more children will be able to claim up to a week and from april what are the conditions the carer eligible parents employ must be registered under a new childcare approval scheme this means they must pass basic key checks including a criminal record check and gain a certificate in basic first aid registration costs every year can i get money for my mum to look after my children no unless she happens to be a childminder also looking after other peoples children and is working outside your home when does it happen nannies can register from january and the childcare approval scheme and the nannies tax break come into

it it depressing to read about the prejudice women mps still face in the uk bullied patronised and abused december doubly so after listening the night before to emilia fernandes director of the womens network rede mulher speaking about the huge challenges angolan women face to participate in the elections angola is a country emerging from a long civil war we dont have the same excuse we might also ponder why countries such as south africa and even rwanda have a higher proportion of women mps than the uk in el salvador pressure from womens organisations has resulted in more women elected in pacts between political parties to support prowomen agendas over other political issues in legally en forcible quotas for women candidates one result is the outlawing of sexual harassment in public places such changes benefit women but also strengthen democracy for all of us the need to support women elected at local and national level doesnt stop when they win a seat further barriers remain a first move in the uk might be to make the minister for women a full independent cabinet post racism rightly isnt tolerated why should we put up with sexism graham bennett director one world action it came as no surprise to read your article on the treatment of women mps i took a group of sixthform politics students last year and was horrified to hear one of the tour guides openly express the view that the status and standing of parliament had declined since more women were allowed in happily both male and female students were horrified by these views and so perhaps offer some hope that the next generation of parliamentarians will be more enlightened assuming that is women have not been put off entirely from the place alex spalding norwich i think you would be doing a greater service by

this week in the wake of the west ham mp tony bankss decision to retire at the forthcoming election labours national executive is expected to ask the constituency to select a candidate from an allwomen shortlist this device used for most seats where the sitting mp has decided in the past year to retire guarantees more women safe seats something that readers of our frontpage story today about the treatment of women mps might think is sensible it is to put it mildly not a universally popular policy but the party decided to face down its critics for a limited period to redress the balance between women and men and as a result it seems certain that as long as its vote holds up it will break the record for women mps many more of them will have comfortable majorities and be able to work with confidence on a career in parliament contrast this with the conservative record philosophically and constitutionally unable to intervene from the centre the party is attempting to reform the selection process with slowburn improvements such as educating local selection committees and introducing a framework of competences by which each candidate must be judged regardless of gender or whether their life experiences match those of the selection panels own children the party boasts that it has already achieved a record number of women candidates yet in the dozen or so of the muchreduced number of safe seats that have come up since only two women candidates have been selected gillian shephard virginia bottomley and marion roe will all be succeeded by men there is increasing frustration both among the women who cannot breach the closed and anxious world of the local tory constituency association and in central office in london where some senior figures fear the party is selecting replicas of failure it is not lost on them that one of labours early steps to electability was to centralise control of the selection process such a step would require reforms as dramatic as those of the s it would almost certainly take a third defeat to give the modernisers the authority to impose it centralised control of candidate selection is not a universal good it risks turning mps into clients of their party hierarchy rather than servants of their constituents and independentminded monitors of government but as a demonstration of a partys willingness to change and

parents are the big winners from this years prebudget report with boosts to the finances and increased access to care for those with babies and young children chancellor gordon brown confirmed a whole raft of benefit increases and funding to improve childcare provision many of them already announced several times in the past he extended paid maternity entitlement from six months to nine from april the government says this could help reduce postnatal depression infant mortality rates and the number of babies with low birthweights while increasing breastfeeding and preventative health care the government plans to increase paid leave again to months by the end of the next parliament and to introduce legislation to enable mothers to transfer a proportion of this to the childs father it admits that young children generally benefit from parental care but stresses that paid work is the best route out of poverty ministers believe this has knockon benefits such as improved educational achievement when a child is older and a better understanding of the link between educational achievement and fulfillment in later life that is why many of the changes are designed to help parents to get back to work by making childcare more affordable the childcare element of the working tax credit claimed by families will increase in april from a maximum to for one child the maximum will rise from to a week for bigger families the proportion of childcare costs parents can claim will rise from per cent to per cent from april about single parents will be offered a aweek bonus in their first year of returning to work the national minimum income guarantee for a couple with one earner and one child will rise to a week and a week for a single parent with one child this is equivalent to a hour the government will ensure that all three and fouryearolds get hours a week of free early education and childcare from increasing to hours a week by childcare at a price will also be offered by schools on weekdays both during term and holidays the government says all families with children between five and should have access to schoolbased care by half will benefit by secondary schools will

the early years world got more than it had hoped for yesterday when the government unveiled its year childcare strategy in the chancellors prebudget report an extension of paid maternity leave the option to share leave between parents an extension of free nursery provision for three and fouryearolds a commitment to improve the quality of the early years workforce these proposals are all welcome and the government should be congratulated for its continued commitment to this agenda but the biggest celebration should be reserved for recognition within the strategy that early years is first and foremost about children and families and not the labour market since the introduction of the governments first childcare strategy in three separate objectives have become entangled in the conversation about services for the very young developing the life chances of children with particular stress on the least welloff improving the balance between work and childcare for working mothers and allowing more women to reenter the labour market these are all laudable aims but they are not the same and they are only complementary up to a point when the prime minister tony blair addressed the daycare trust last month his speech was about flexibility for working families and about the life chances of children yesterdays strategy sets the record straight acknowledging that the needs of children and families cannot be compromised in pursuit of labour market objectives the two must be advanced together while much of the strategy does just that there is one aspect that should cause us concern childcare for three to yearolds will continue to be funded through the childcare tax credit so far the childcare tax credit has not succeeded in either of its objectives to create affordable childcare for parents and to make disadvantaged areas more profitable for providers the increase in the subsidy available to parents will help but it will not do enough to reduce the burden of spending on childcare on parents parents spent bn on early years services in almost the same as the amount spent out of public finds bn according to the strategy the increase in the childcare tax credit will reduce the parental contribution for childcare from of total costs to for a family earning a year meanwhile parents in the eu contribute on average only of the total costs of care access to high quality provision relies too heavily on parents ability to pay the inadvertent consequence of this is that childcare is weakest where it is most needed the low level of demand in poor areas means provision is not viable or sustainable childcare places were created between and but closed these tend to be in the places where the gain to children could be the greatest ethnic minority lone parent and lowincome households are least likely to use formal childcare of asian parents used registered childcare in compared to of white parents an approach predicated on improving life chances would suggest a reduction in the level of parents contribution in favour of greater public funding for providers bringing parental contributions down to average eu levels would cost in the region of bn according to estimates by accountants pricewaterhousecoopers this dwarfs the m that the government has set aside for a transformation fund to improve the sustainability of childcare places but well within the course of the year strategy the costs would start to be balanced out by the economic benefits of more women in the labour market by greater output and by a reduction in child poverty the original welfare state largely ignored families for the first five years of a childs life neglecting important opportunities to promote life chances if early years provision is to become a new frontier of the welfare state for the st century we must remove parents ability to pay as a criterion of access the governments longterm ambition to reduce further the proportion of childcare costs

divorced and separated women who defy court orders and refuse to let their former partners see their children may be subjected to curfews and electronically tagged under a draft bill expected from the government soon judges will be given powers to impose a range of sanctions on parents who flout contact orders including forcing them to do community service or undergo anger management courses ordering defiant parents to see a psychiatrist for an assessment has not been ruled out the draft bill is expected to be sent for scrutiny to a joint committee of peers and mps and be ready to be introduced in the next parliament if labour is reelected because it will be a draft bill it will not fall if this session is cut short as expected by a general election at present judges have limited powers to penalise parents usually mothers who refuse to obey court orders giving separated or divorced fathers the right to be with their children the only options are to fine or jail the mother or where they believe her intransigence is damaging the children to order that they should live with their father instead the bill responds to pressure from judges and fathers groups which have argued for years that the courts need wider powers to enforce contact orders effectively it forms part of a package of reforms designed to rescue the family justice system which even ministers judges and officials admit is failing as the militant group fathers justice steps up its protest campaign before christmas a range of measures will be aimed at helping parents avoid damaging and costly court battles and reach their own agreements on looking after the children a pilot scheme that has just begun in london brighton and sunderland will give parents information on the harm their disputes can cause their children and put them through group sessions on managing conflict with their expartners former couples will then be helped to negotiate their own parenting plans the project will be evaluated next october and a decision taken around april whether to extend it throughout england and wales ministers believe that legal aid which rewards lawyers more highly for court representation than for negotiating settlements helps to nudge parents into unnecessary court battles at the taxpayers expense about of civil legal aid costs goes on battles between separated parents over their children a consultation paper last june estimated that up to of the family cases which went court need not and should not really be there statistics show that where a parent is publicly funded disputes about children take longer to resolve ministers believe this is partly because neither the parents nor their solicitors have any financial incentive to settle early the proposed legal aid changes which will not need primary legislation include paying lawyers more for resolving cases at an early stage than for representing a client in court one of the main aims of the reforms is to curb spending on divorce and family cases other plans include restricting legal aid for multiple applications relating to children to stop parents rushing back to court each time a problem arises there
