tomorrow the equal opportunities commission celebrates its th birthday it was set up in a rush in to coincide with the establishment of the equal pay and sex discrimination acts legislation intended to expedite a new world for women and ethnic minorities initially a sickly child the eoc under its chair of two years julie mellor has begun to show teeth but what of the state of women a quarter of a century ago the nd attempt to get equal pay on to the statute books was finally successfully guided by barbara castle then minister of employment companies were given five years to adjust not untypically one company issued a list of discrimination factors among them the willingness to work overtime the lads were kept ahead of the girls who were instantly handicapped because of the kids at home and now these are contradictory times some say the battle is over others are too exhausted to know while if polemicists are to be believed men have cause to be mad about women with the collapse of heavy industry and the high divorce rate some men argue that they are emasculated and excluded from home and work forced into what was once the womans role secondclass citizen the eoc is using its celebrations to challenge some of this thinking aware that equality for women has always required that men too should be liberated from the straitjacket of gender stereotyping it has commissioned research which analyses how far women and men have actually come does the traditional breadwinner rest in peace an increasing number of men under look after their children its just that they dont call it childcare according to one study of yearolds disagree that a mans job is to earn the money a womans to look after the home and family the eoc is calling for a national debate on how to forge a social contract for the st century between men and women employers and employees government and the electorate one that draws on notions of modern citizenship and builds on labours recognition that childcare and the worklife issue is no longer a private affair but a central part of its economic strategy and a matter of social justice more persuasive than rhetoric however is the clout carried by profit and loss put bluntly the present jalopy of a system in which the average male works a hour week and the family remains invisible costs a packet for instance days lost to stress alone are estimated to cost british industrybn per year at the same time the rewards of those few businesses who are proactive are obvious one recent survey of the ftse companies showed that the quarter who have a stcentury agenda on discrimination and flexibility had shares which on average over a fiveyear period from had risen by compared with the ftse average of in spite of this the pay gap has shifted little since the s it stands at for fulltime female employees but a whopping for m parttimers much attention is paid to the half a million working women out of m who pay tax at the top whack but on average a fulltime man earns a woman as a society mellor says weve accepted equality as part of the wallpaper but in truth weve stagnated class race and qualifications divide women but they have discrimination in common the middle skilled childless woman has a lifetime earnings gap of compared with her male colleague a mother of two pays an extra penalty of if a woman takes a year out to

it has already learned about pay scales cartmail says has proved a bit of a shock among underwriters and brokers for instance fulltime women earn p for every earned by a man confidentiality is a requirement of some jobs but we want everybody talking about pay she says unequal pay is about cash job segregation the low value attached to caring the parttime penalty the attitudes of managers and a female tendency to undersell ourselves as part of its valuing women campaign the eoc demonstrated how prejudice remains alive and well among line managers some still see women as less ambitious and committed so they deny them bonusrelated pay the problem is not helped by the weakness in the sex discrimination and equal pay acts it took years for speech therapists to win m in back pay next month the eocs equal pay task force will publish its report it might advise stronger legislation compulsory pay audits and contract compliance what is also required is class action and the clout to demand profound structural change mellor would like a duty placed on the public sector to eradicate discrimination heather wakefield of unison says local government faces a massive equal pay problem exacerbated by the consequences of privatisation the average salary is the average age seven out of employees are women and they are expressing their frustration with their feet equality and

employers were yesterday accused by the equal opportunities commission of being shockingly complacent over continuing large scale pay inequality after it released evidence of widespread discrimination against women across the workforce an eoc survey of plus large employers found that women were commonly denied access to bonuses and performancerelated pay while more than reported that part time employees mainly women were illegally excluded from pension schemes the hourly earnings of women were on average lower than those of men but the weekly and annual gap was around because of the effect of discrimination over pensions bonuses and performancerelated pay the eoc report found that manufacturing industry had a worse record than the public sector or private services of failing to take action over gender pay inequality while at the same time manufacturing employers were by far the most confident that their pay systems were fair many employers are simply burying their heads in the sand the eoc chairwoman julie mellor said yesterday employers have a major role in eliminating pay discrimination and manufacturing organisations in particular are not doing enough to ensure they are paying women fairly the cbi the main employers organisation last night hit back at the criticism insisting there was little evidence to suggest most firms were operating unfair pay structures there is a pay gap but the reasons for it are much more complex than simple direct discrimination susan anderson the director of cbi human resources policy said research shows the key cause of the pay gap is occupational segregation women are more likely to work in lower paying sectors but ms mellor countered that studies at the london school of economics and for the economic and social research council had found that up to a half of the earnings gap between women and men could be attributed to pay discrimination at work rather than job segregation she added that employers needed to reassess why jobs carried out mainly by women were often worse paid than those done by men the report found that many human resources managers in manufacturing industry regarded maledominated professional technical and skilled manual jobs as having greater intrinsic value than femaledominated support and administrative jobs,2001-01,employer yesterday accused equal opportunity commission shockingly complacent

the government was yesterday criticised by trade unions after it rejected proposals to force employers to review pay by gender in an effort to close the pay gap as a report by the equal opportunities commission confirmed that the uk has the worst record in europe on equal pay ministers made it clear that pay audits would remain voluntary the recommendation which was a key to the studys proposals to abolish the pay gap within eight years is fiercely resisted by business which claims it would create an impossible administrative burden the cbi condemned the proposal as ineffective and disproportionate and insisted that women were paid less mainly because of family responsibilities and their concentration in low paid occupations rather than because of discrimination by employers however the tuc said there was nothing to make bad employers review pay its president bill morris said if you have ruled out any kind of statutory mechanism it does not seem to me that you have got too much going for you because you have ruled out any means of compliance thirtyone years after the passing of the equal pay act the gap between the hourly earnings of women working parttime and men working fulltime has barely changed standing at up to of the pay gap was caused not by occupational segregation or womens share of family responsibilities but by discrimination the study found the recommendations include moves to raise awareness of the pay gap and simplifying the system of equal pay employment tribunals however amid opposition from business ministers will not impose a statutory duty on employers to conduct pay audits insisting that a voluntary approach will work employment minister tessa jowell said we dont think mandatory pay reviews are the way forward as a first step she

the government will today be challenged to review womens pay in the public sector as a hardhitting report finds that britains gender pay gap is the worst in the european union thirty years after the equal pay act women in fulltime work are still earning only fourfifths of what men do the equal opportunities commissions equal pay task force will press ministers to compel employers to conduct pay audits to address the gender gap its report just pay will highlight britains place at the bottom of the eu league on equal pay while women working fulltime earn on average of male fulltime hourly earnings up from in parttime female workers receive only of male fulltime hourly wages compared with a european average of the proposal is designed to produce greater pay transparency in businesses which can be expected to resist the measure on grounds of cost and bureaucracy the commission will also call on the government to lead the way in reviewing pay differences on the basis that many low paid occupations dominated by women including nursing caring and cleaning jobs are in the public sector the report will also find that occupations traditionally regarded as womens work are still undervalued in the uk with women working fulltime as nurses earning less than average male hourly earnings other european countries also offer women better maternity rights and significantly better childcare provision the study compiled by a task force including business leaders trade unionists civil servants and academics highlights a problem which the governments womens unit has exposed but which ministers have done little to reverse a year ago the unit published research exposing the female forfeit and concluding that women earn less than men over a lifetime not because they may take time off to bring up children but because of pay discrimination and their concentration in lower paid occupations at the time womens ministers lady jay and tessa jowell stopped short of moves to compel employers to examine pay structures focusing instead on encouraging girls to opt for better paid careers and urging women to ask male colleagues what they earned todays study will confirm both that little has happened since to change the pay gap and that business will strongly resist any requirement to conduct audits a key element in the resistance to the move by some in government a spokeswoman for the cbi said yesterday we dont believe that the pay gap is actually the result of deliberate discrimination by employers we think pay is a far more complex issue than that women had the choice of entering better paid occupations she said the commissions report however argues that the pay gap cannot be explained by womens educational and career choices since often as more women

poor baroness jay there she was hoping to hand in her notice as leader of the house of lords and minister for women and tiptoe out of the back door with as little fuss as possible and then those nasty busybodies at the equal opportunities commission complete a survey trumpeting the failure of her womens unit to be fair the findings published today are as much an indictment of new labour as they are of the unit it created to look after womens interests in terms of equal pay and equal opportunities britain is the most sexist place to work in europe red faces all around the party that had raised such hopes and manufactured such hype about its prowomen agenda remember all the boasts about more female mps than ever before the groundbreaking breastfeeding blair babes will now enter the general election with a set of statistics that will further alienate female voters a million of whom say theyve gone off the government the picture is bleak indeed if you care about how your wage packet compares with the man who does the same job as you youre better off in france germany or even portugal the wage gap in these countries is less than in britain where a woman working full time earns just of her male colleagues salary for a parttime female worker that sinks to if you care about paid maternity leave youd better up sticks and move to italy where a mother gets five months paid leave or finland nine months as well as days for paternity leave in britain you get a paltry weeks add to this poor childcare provision and in predominantly female professions such as nursing an average pay of less than overall average male earnings in the uk and you can see why the european council of ministers told the uk to get down to work on closing the pay gap they have their work cut out for them thirty years since the equal pay act was passed women find the workplace as inimical as the factory caricatured in charlie chaplins mod ern times talk to staff at the eoc and they can name endless cases of women who have had to take their employers to court to receive fair treatment take dr lorna chessum a female lecturer at leicesters de montfort university who discovered she had been appointed on a lower salary less than a similarly qualified male colleague she received compensation in an outofcourt settlement in september then theres doreen mcmanus who worked as a payroll administrator for rentokil she claimed that over three years she did the same work as a male colleague whom she trained and who was paid more than her she took the matter up with her employer who agreed to review her pay her salary was increased but she was still earning less than her colleague she lodged an equal pay claim and rentokil settled the case paying her compensation two small victories in a war we thought was won long ago a war in which we cannot count on either government or employer as an ally jill rubery as the co ordinator of the european commissions expert group on gender and equality was present when the commission having seen the uks national action plan for employment last year publicly reprimanded the country for its appalling employment figures immediately our civil servants started to rubbish the data as insufficient and emphasise the high employment rate we have for women which is well above the target by set in lisbon in the spin machine is likely to go into overdrive after the eoc survey too despite its impressive credentials the research was carried out by the nop group in the summer last year it involved a telephone survey of senior human resource managers in organisations with at least employees telephone interviews with national trade union officials and indepth casestudy research in selected organisations while government apologists may spin against the eoc survey for painting too gloomy a picture of the working womans lot critics of the government suspect that the survey in fact lets the government off lightly mary davis who heads the centre for trade union studies at the university of north london argues industry by industry the gender pay gap has actually widened since i see no evidence apart from the introduction of the national minimum wage to support the view that we are wit nessing a narrowing of the gap among workingclass women certainly things have got worse if youre living in a textile town for instance with the industry bottoming out beneath your feet you are far poorer than before rubery who with damian grimshaw carried out the research for the eoc feels that even some of the states povertybusting initiatives have had a negative impact on womens wages the working families tax credit for example contradicted the equalpay ethos by trapping the second incomeearner in a low paying job moreover as both davis and rubery point out a government that believes that any regulation hinders the market and has abdicated all responsibility for pay structure cannot intervene in the one area that most affects the gender pay gap the market indeed has become a fig leaf behind which employers can hide discrimination you can get away with paying jane less than joe by signing them up to individualised contracts there are a million weasel words that allow you to claim that what she is doing is not exactly the same as what he does equally there are many ways of explaining away why promotion keeps eluding her the trade unions once the battering rams for victims of unfair treatment at work have lost their bite collective bargaining has declined in recent years today less than one in three workplaces is covered by it meanwhile employer accountability has grown ever more nebulous in an increasing number of situations there is no single clearcut employer as is the case when work is subcontracted or joint ventures or partnerships operate this makes it difficult to uphold legislationbased on comparable work for the same employer the fragmentation of the public sector through the contracting out of services to the private sector also contributes to the difficulty in monitoring the wage differential not surprisingly this state of affairs gets the thumbs up from employers of those who took part in the eoc survey cheerfully believed their pay systems were fair those of us who feel that if jane and joe carry out the same work they should bring home the same pay packet will simply have to provide fodder for the eocs case studies or move to lisbon this is a version of an article first published in this weeks new statesman,2001-02,poor baroness jay wa hoping hand notice

picture the scene you are a woman who works alongside a man who does exactly the same job as you in exactly the same office one day you both go for promotion who do you think gets it him of course at least thats what women overwhelmingly believe according to a new survey by recruitment consultancy officeteam most female pas have a perception that their male counterparts will always get promoted faster than them even though its a profession that is femaledominated says sarah thomas who was involved in the research but she insists our study also found that the reality is that there is no truth in this concern whatsoever pas no matter what their gender get promoted on merit indeed similar studies that have been carried out since men started entering the profession have come to the same conclusion that blokes are by no means treated as superior in the secretarial world so why the female fear alison stimpson a careers adviser claims it stems from the fact that men increasingly use support roles as a first rung on their career ladder with around double the number in higher education than a decade ago graduates have had to find news ways into professions secretarial work has proved to be the most popular route particularly for men in other words while it appears that men are megaquick at getting promotion the reality is that they are megaquick at proactively seeking out higher status roles indeed a recent report by the tuc found that the number of men in secretarial jobs has risen by over the past three years and that most of these are graduates alistair smith an analyst in the city is one of them i decided to use a pa role as a steppingstone because i realised id learn far more about business by working daytoday with a top businessman than i ever would have from a graduate trainee scheme where i might be one of people struggling to get noticed i had access to highlevel people and had every intention from day one to have his job one day i succeeded he says meanwhile sarah eldoori of recruitment consultancy office angels believes that rather than men talking themselves into promotion women tend to talk themselves out of it its my experience that female secretaries say things like oh im not that great at my job whereas men boast about their achievements thats the real gender split among support staff this claim is backed by a new study by gallup which found that women are far more likely to underrate their performance at work than men are and that this could be one of the reasons why many women fail to get highranking jobs if as our research reveals womens selfassessments are less positive than those given to them by other people they may not progress as fast as men explains haihai yuan coauthor of the a gallup report on appraisals mick cooper senior lecturer in applied social science at brighton university believes women may have every reason to be worried about the reentry of men into the profession what research hasnt yet concluded is whether its the increased responsibilities and status of secretarial work that has led to more men doing the job or whether the fact that more men do the job has led to the increased responsibilities and status he says if its the latter men are in danger of pushing women back out of the picture consider russia in the s and s he says there was a sudden influx of women becoming doctors and the status of doctors then dropped with men opting out sadly it is still possible for gender to have this kind of influence and what we could be witnessing here is the flip side of the coin in fact as james reed chief executive of reed employment services points out originally secretarial work was restricted to men as mastering a keyboard was felt to be too technical for women forty years ago that trend was reversed and it was seen as almost inevitably a female domain today however its changing again and could theoretically become maledominated once more for now however there appears to be no such threat indeed steven durham pa to the assistant director at camden local education authority says despite men now accounting for of support staff and women panicking that well take over the gender divide has been eradicated in other professions a lot quicker than in the secretarial world i have found for instance that there is a resistance particularly among male employers to employ male support staff a spokesperson from recruitment consultancy marshall tapp agrees five per cent of respondents to one of our surveys said they would not give a mans cv the same consideration as a womans one said he wouldnt consider it because the idea was so odd and another said he would assume that they were homosexual,2001-02,picture scene woman work alongside man

accident insurance for children is an emotive subject no parent can bear to think of their child being hurt and the idea of benefiting financially from a childs injuries is quite abhorrent but nor do parents like the idea of having to fight for compensation if the injuries are serious so a policy that pays out a predetermined sum without quibble in the event of an injury may be a good idea after all if your child loses the use of a leg would come in useful for adapting your home so your child could get around more easily these policies tend to be reasonably low cost boots sells one at a year for one child or for two or more children while ace insurances firstcover policy costs a year for one child or for two or more children the amounts paid out vary considerably firstcover for example will pay up to if your child suffers total paralysis total loss of intellectual capacity total loss of sight in both eyes or the loss of the use of a hand arm or leg above the knee for the loss or loss of use of a lung it would pay kidney and spleen it also pays for educational support for each month a child is unable to attend school up to a year and for each day a child is in hospital but the vast majority of claims are for broken bones which get little in the way of a payout for an arm and for a leg even though parents may have to take time off work to nurse their child but do you really need an accidental injury policy especially when your child is likely to be covered at school by the schools or local councils liability cover debbie gibson a spokeswoman for ace insurance says the policy really comes into its own with more serious injuries when parents might be waiting for a personal injury litigation case to be settled she points to the case of darren coombs see separate box who is having to sue for damages four years after being hit by a car she says in these circumstances it would be helpful to have a no fault accident policy which will pay out regardless of who is deemed to be the cause of the accident she also points to the increasing number of children injured playing sports according to data supplied by the department of trade amp industrys hasslass report children aged or under were injured playing rugby each year in the early s but this figure had risen to by while it may be possible to sue the school for damages if your child is seriously hurt while playing sport this depends on the referee being negligent and who do you sue if the accident was the childs own fault christine crossfield manager of the personal accident department for insurance broker hsbc says parents can only claim against a school if it has been negligent but thats not always the case children have accidents its the way they are claims often result from accidents occurring out of school hours two claims dealt with by hsbc involved a child who fell from a camel which had stumbled breaking the childs back and another who suffered a broken neck after falling backwards while sitting on a ft wall on top of a hill before you rush to insure your children however it may be worth checking if they are covered through their school while state schools rarely provide anything other than liability cover many private schools offer group policies family forced to fight for sons compensation a yearold boy left with brain damage after a road accident four years ago is being forced to sue the driver involved for compensation darren coombs who now has a mental age of seven was hit by a car while cycling to a friends house nearby his solicitors have made a

the prospect of women ministers taking full maternity leave and then returning to their departments will become so normal that no one will bat an eyelid according to the first minister to plan to do so yvette cooper the public health minister who is expecting her second child in midaugust will take a complete break from red boxes the daily intrays stuffed with ministerial documents and parliamentary legislative duties when she goes on leave for around five months in july arrangements to cover for her absence assuming labour wins the expected spring general election have yet to be nailed down but options could include appointing another mp to cover her role or distributing elements of the job among other health ministers the complexity of finding cover for her role is compounded by the fact that ministers are not in law employees subject to normal employment legislation but office holders with unique status the yearold minister speaking in the week that the leader of the lords and minister for women baroness jay announced plans to quit her cabinet post because her worklife balance had shifted out of kilter is clear that any problems can be surmounted her confidence may be wellfounded while her announcement may have sent department of health mandarins into a spin a government which says it supports familyfriendly employment policies cannot be seen to be a careless employer ms cooper has already rescheduled her day to ensure that her red boxes are dealt with during the day instead of at home in the evening as is traditional leaving her free to spend time with her family its business as usual she insisted amid a breakneck schedule of meetings a hospital visit and a sweet factory tour in her pontefract and castleford constituency millions of women take maternity leave from jobs and it ought to be normal in every occupation and every walk of life people at work have families too one day no one will bat an eyelid at ministers taking maternity leave because of course its something that ministers mps nurses businesswomen and everybody else needs to be able to do ms cooper who took five months maternity leave after the birth of ellie now months is keen to see attention paid instead to the maternity and child health services she will be using under a new drive to address the inequalities which mean that uk children from low income backgrounds suffer poorer health and higher death rates than their more affluent counterparts the government has set a new infant mortality target amid evidence that the death rate of babies under one in the lowest income areas is higher than in the most affluent areas the aim is to reduce the gap between the poorest and the average by in years equal treatment in a move designed to iron out the postcode lottery affecting child health care ministers are to draw up a new childrens national service framework nhs jargon for a plan to offer equal treatment and services including maternity care across the country the step follows recent moves to extend the sure start programme aimed at helping poorer families with children under four to support expectant mothers and an initiative to provide free daily fruit in infant schools ms cooper who pushed strongly within her department for the focus on child health points to the relatively lower birthweight of babies from low income homes together with statistics showing that smaller babies have increased risk of higher blood pressure and heart disease later in life if you look at the health inequalities issue so many of them are rooted very early in life if not passed down from one generation to another the government with its pledge to abolish child poverty within years has much to do the latest published figures for show that m children in the uk were living in poverty one of the worst rates among industrialised countries the numbers have since been reduced by m according to government figures but child poverty campaigners warn those deepest in poverty will be hardest to lift out more passionate ms cooper admits personal experience has strengthened her concern over child health when you are a parent inevitably it makes you more sensitive or more passionate about what happens to young children because it is what you see immediately around you in your own life in the same way when you are using maternity services and talking to other parents that can be quite effective for the policymaking process because you are not divorced from the policy area you are working on ms cooper will take the statutory weeks leave on full ministerial pay at the birth of the baby her husband ed balls also at new labours epicentre as chancellor gordon browns closest aide will take two weeks paternity leave and will continue to help out with childcare in the evenings publicly she will refuse to admit she is doing anything unusual though the prospect of a minister taking maternity leave inevitably breaks

junior health minister yvette cooper has made history as the first ever minister to take maternity leave on the relatively generous terms of weeks on full pay finally it seems that the department of health has produced its most positive contribution to the public health debate ms cooper is doing something politicians rarely manage which is to lead by example even tony blairs fudged paternity leave after the arrival of baby leo taking things easy for a couple of weeks while refusing to let john prescott actually take the reins of power smacked of a third way that hardly put the new baby or its mother first despite enormous improvements in maternity benefits there is still a lingering suggestion that women who either choose between career and family or who squeeze out babies between meetings and pretend nothing has happened are somehow better employees acres of newsprint were devoted to the case of sue clark director of corporate affairs at scottish power when two years ago she stayed at her desk during labour and was able via the magic of teleconferencing to complete a deal within two days of her baby being born for those of us returning from a leisurely maternity leave even longer than ms coopers this example is enough to make the blood run cold the incessant crying insecurity and constant need for food which follow childbirth makes it impossible for most of us to contemplate returning to work within four or five months and that is even before one takes into account the needs of the baby in ms clarks case she planned only eight weeks off barely time to establish a routine for a newborn but the companys feelings were quite clear everyone in the company appreciates sues determination a scottish power spokesman purred he should have been saying the chief executives furious she put her own health at risk for the sake of a commercial transaction and hes ordered her not to come back for at least six months because the truth is that when you take proper time off after giving birth you actually come back able to handle the real world without bursting into tears or forgetting where you live ms cooper has made history but now she has to follow

twentyfive years ago a tailor called mrs kersten had her brief moment in the limelight when she won a landmark case and was awarded equal pay with a male colleague who had been getting more for doing a similar job eleven years on in a certain ms white a machinist and several female colleagues were also involved in a key case again supported by the equal opportunities commission they too were awarded a pay rise in line with the pay of male upholsterers they worked with the progress of equal opportunities is slow and painful as the eoc celebrates the twentyfifth anniversary of the sex discrimination act it can look back on some important achievements but it is also positioning itself for more fights the eoc points out that in the past years the gap between the proportion of women and men in the labour market has fallen from to per cent the percentage of directors and managers who are women has increased from per cent in to per cent in in the needs of working parents and carers were low on the public policy agenda now employment law includes the right for parents to take time off after the birth of a child or if their child is unwell and improvements have been made to maternity rights and rights for parttimers paternity leave and extended maternity rights are under discussion but there is a long way to go more women than men are in lowskilled lowpaid jobs with little access to vocational training and education per cent of parttime workers are women the same proportion as in at the same time women receive only per cent of mens hourly wages a situation exacerbated for parttime women workers who earn per cent of the average hourly earnings of fulltime male counterparts in a recent european survey on equal pay britain came tenth out of countries julie mellor chair of the eoc says most women are still trapped in a lifecycle of inequality working in lowpaid lowstatus jobs and struggling to combine work and family responsibilities caring for children and older relatives british fathers work the longest hours in europe and many are prevented from spending time with their children we must not think weve made it just because a few women have reached the top of their field and a few employers now offer paternity leave the reality of most peoples everyday lives is still determined by their sex baroness helena kennedy chair of the british council says the reform of working practices for men as well as for women is at the heart of promoting sex equality in the uk over at the commission for racial equality there is a firm belief in the importance of reform in this area the cre is getting ready to put flesh on the bones of a new piece of legislation it is hailing as the biggest shift in employment practice on the race equality front for almost two decades the race relations amendment act alters the act in a way that will it is hoped turn the public sector into a model equal opportunities employer said a cre spokesman the act said thou shalt not discriminate or you may be prosecuted the amended legislation says if you are a public sector employer you must deliver equality of opportunities and here is a code of practice that you must follow home secretary jack straw will be publishing draft regulations for consultation this month the cre plans to publish the draft codes of practice in june or july the cre spokesman said instead of knocking on doors and saying could you ever so kindly work for racial equality we will have a code of practice that the public sector must abide by for instance the police will have a requirement to show that they have fully implemented equal opportunity employment practices as well as showing an equal opportunities commitment in the way they treat the public the nhs too will be among the public sector bodies taking a long hard look at its employment practices last week the cre revealed the details of a survey it carried out into working practices in nhs trusts in the south of england the usual picture emerged the spokesman said people say they are against discrimination but only per cent of the trusts were able to demonstrate good equality programmes this is the nhs which has depended on ethnic minorities to carry the service the newly formed disability rights commission is young enough still to be brighteyed and bushy tailed in its approach to pushing through reforms in the workplace against the background of the disability discrimination act the drc has launched its first major initiative actions speak louder than words part of which involves approaching companies and asking them to make a commitment to promoting equality of opportunity for the disabled over and above the requirements of the act the argument the drc is presenting to business is that there are million disabled people in the uk with a combined income of billion a year so it makes good business sense to be seen as disabledfriendly as well as demonstrating admirable social responsibility organisations backing the campaign include microsoft lloyds tsb the halifax transport company arriva and the tuc microsofts commitment involves links with online recruitment company totaljobscom and disability charity leonard cheshire to launch a webbased service for disabled people seeking a new career the site is expected to open in early summer the halifax has committed itself to increasing the number of people with learning disabilities it employs initially at its head office the initiative underlines the drcs emphasis on communication as well as litigation drc chairman bert massie says we have learned a lot from the eoc experience we have not had to be so litigious we started out with statutory codes of practice so have not had to rely so much on case law but there is nothing quite like statutory clout to improve an organisations powers of persuasion massie gives an example of a restaurant that refused entry to a blind person because of their guide dog instead of taking the restaurant to court the drc persuaded it to pay and also allow a drc team to come in and talk to their staff this duly happened the staff were shown the error of their ways and now the restaurant happily welcomes blind people drc helpline eoc helpline cre helpline opportunities galore a free service aimed at small businesses offering information and advice on what the law says about

female voters are falling out of love with labour a new report which will shock tony blairs strategists reveals that fewer than a third of women are happy with the way the country is run the prime ministers personal satisfaction rating among women fell from in january to by november with women slower than men to forgive mistakes such as the fuel protests and pensions fiasco the analysis by the influential fawcett society thinktank reveals a sharp rise in the dissatisfaction gap the difference between the number of men and women who say they are unhappy with the government which is used to measure hidden female disillusionment this rose from zero last summer to nine points by december fawcett director mary ann stephenson says blair could woo women back by championing working mothers causes in the runup to the election and suggests the backlash now could be because women are impatient for results on labours familyfriendly agenda voters warmed to blair as an honorary woman who understood their problems because of his own children focus groups run by fawcett found but they were scornful of attempts to manipulate his image when he appears in his jeans he looks so false was one typical response however there is no evidence women are turning to the tories the focus groups were almost uniformly rude about william hague the analysis published tomorrow comes amid a crucial fight for the favours of worcester woman the mythical middle england mother who swung the election and will heavily influence the next entitled where is worcester woman the report says turnout could be badly hit if disillusioned women do not vote making keeping them on board the hardest and most crucial challenge for labour none of the political parties can afford to take the votes of women for granted the report says winning these votes will require policies that women are able to see will bring real benefits to them and their families labour is already trying to feminise its election campaign planning to feature fewer statistics and more real people telling real stories a favourite womens magazine tactic such as single mothers who have turned their lives around mps want more highprofile female faces in the campaign polling shows womens favourites are blair gordon brown and david blunkett while the bestknown female mps are mo mowlam not even standing this time and harriet harman fawcetts focus groups found that women sympathised with blair when his teenage son euan was found drunk and his ratings peaked just before baby leos birth but he was criticised for sending his children to a top grantmaintained school and for attempts to look down to earth politicians used to be smart with a suit and tie and then blair decided he was going to be in touch with the common people and wear jeans hague was derided for a lack of gravitas theyll need another woman to run the tories said one nearly twothirds of women over usually tory leaders strongest supporters are not satisfied with hague while his gender dissatisfaction gap is an alarming points among core tory voters the report shows that fears of a backlash among men if labour pushes too many womens issues are unfounded with issues like better childcare overwhelmingly popular with both sexes nearly threequarters of men rated paid parental leave as important and among the age group most likely to have children an overwhelming of both sexes considered good affordable childcare a priority health education and pensions all mattered more to female than male voters the single currency was a female

women are adopting macho working patterns and sacrificing family lives in order to get ahead despite moves to make the workplace more familyfriendly psychologists said yesterday although the government is increasing statutory maternity leave and many employers have polices which should allow women to achieve a better worklife balance many women still feel they must conform to the male way of working across the corporate spectrum successful women are working long hours and taking short maternity leaves researchers janet smithson of manchester metropolitan university elizabeth stokoe of university college worcester and chris coupland of birmingham university looked at women working in banking retail and accountancy women managers tend to talk about themselves in male terms im still my own man etc and they feel they have to keep up with the hours men work network alongside them and take as little leave there were some women who took only two weeks off after having a baby said ms smithson the researchers found that the concept of flexible hours was a myth women were expected to arrive early leave late and go for a drink after work with their colleagues or face slipping down the career ladder other research unveiled at the british psychological societys conference revealed that women were generally disadvantaged in interviews but still managed to perform better than men jo silvester of city university london looked at the graduate recruitment programme of a petrochemical company she discovered that men were generally allowed to talk for longer in interviews and were asked openended questions which allow for lengthy responses women on the other hand were asked closed questions and were not given so long too talk despite this they performed better in facetoface interviews than men although women were being asked more closed questions than men they were presenting themselves better and they were more in control said dr silvester,2001-03,woman adopting macho

the government was yesterday urged to go further to close the pay gap between men and women as it unveiled plans to rely on exhortation rather than legislation to persuade employers to pay fairly campaigners questioned the decision to rule out legislation to compel firms to review their pay structures to root out inequalities in favour of a voluntary system twentyfive years after the passing of the equal pay act the government yesterday set out measures intended to help close the pay gap which still means women fulltime workers on average earn four fifths of mens wages the employment minister tessa jowell announced the creation of fair pay champions including trade unionists and business leaders who will promote pay equality she also unveiled plans for annual awards for employers who conduct and act on pay reviews however while equality campaigners praised government efforts to highlight the continuing pay gap they warned that new legislation was needed to address bad employers who continue to flout pay laws maryann stephenson director of the womens rights pressure group the fawcett society said there is no reason not to introduce compulsory pay audits now the reason we the trades unions and the equal opportunities commission have been calling for legislation is that companies have not been doing pay reviews under a voluntary system in a report published last month the eocs equal pay task force called for compulsory audits saying no real progress could be made without them the government opted for a voluntary approach wary of prompting a backlash from business over excess regulation business groups including the cbi which has fiercely resisted compulsory audits yesterday welcomed the an nouncement john cridland cbi deputy director general said this is a good set of proposals for tackling the gender pay gap which should be both workable for business and effective for women in the workplace ms jowell yesterday told an industrial society conference

its so cold on the streets and so frightening says marie a yearold student who ran away from a birmingham care home just before she was she felt that she had no choice but to run away because the stepfather who had sexually abused her as a child which led to her going into care in the first place kept following her he would appear and sit next to her as she sat on the bus to school and hang around the care home when i was he was jailed for the abuse for a while but it was all over the papers and everyone knew what he had done to me she says in the end i couldnt stand it and felt the only thing i could do was run away she finished her gcses took a job washing up in a restaurant for three weeks to save enough money for a train ticket to london and then ran the worst thing was that no one would listen to me she recalls i was scared and nervous when i got on the train but i felt i couldnt go back to the situation i had left behind kids will only run away if the situation they are in is so bad that living on the streets seems like a better option something has got to be really wrong to make a young person do a thing like that marie was so terrified when she arrived at euston station that she simply walked the streets for three days too frightened of what might happen if she lay down and closed her eyes i felt so alone in the world she says nobody in my care home bothered to report me missing the streets are full of homeless young people crying out for love marie was one of an estimated young people who run away each year the commonest reasons for children taking flight include desperation at not being listened to rows with parents over the amount of freedom they are allowed bullying at school and drug problems or abuse at home a new paper from the social exclusion unit consultation on young runaways highlights the problem and puts a variety of solutions to the problem out to consultation by the age of one in nine children will have run away for at least one night with a quarter of those ending up sleeping rough some have to survive through begging stealing or prostitution and many are sexually abused on the streets while children like marie who have been in care make up a large proportion of runaways approximately four in the report finds that are fleeing stepfamilies and oneparent families compared to who live with both birth parents but contrary to stereotype poverty was found not to be a significant factor leading to young people running away those from leafy suburbs are just as likely to flee as those from deprived innercity areas the majority of runaways are aged between and and are more likely to be girls than boys although boys tend to run away earlier and more often it is not only a problem of troubled adolescence an estimated children under also run away each year of whom about a third are under eight shockingly a further children a year are thrown out by their parents the report also notes that the longer runaways are away the more vulnerable they become there is no national network of services in place so emergency organisations like childline find it very hard to refer children who phone in a crisis to appropriate local services the report proposes a series of measures both to prevent young people from running away in the first place and to provide decent support services when they do plans include an interview for each young person who has run away to identify the reasons for fleeing and to try to tackle them rather than just dumping the children back in the situation from which they have fled a network of refuges so that young people are not forced to live rough and the establishment of a named person in each area to coordinate services for runaways chris now ran away from numerous care placements about times he believes that refuges are essential but also that fundamental changes in the care system are necessary i was frightened on the streets he recalls but i also felt free i shoplifted to survive i received no support in care nobody listened and i was bullied for me living on the streets was better than that much of the data in the governments new report comes from research carried out by the childrens society which has been working with young runaways for the past years the charitys penny dean welcomed the report but is urging the government to implement some of the proposals such as providing children with interviews right away rather than await the outcome of the threemonth consultation process a social exclusion unit spokesman has responded that this would not be possible i really hope the government wont delay over this says dean young runaways are a very hard to reach group who need a lot of support a lot of these young people view statutory agencies with mistrust and we need a mechanism to draw together expertise from the voluntary sector to deliver the services young people want she condemns the lack of funding for refuges centrepoint in london is the only one in britain and argues that although the concept of childrens refuges was established in the children act the money to run them has not been forthcoming from the government without such refuges there is no safety net to protect children from the dangers of the streets besides the government recommendations the childrens society is calling for more early intervention to prevent running away support and mediation for parents and children where families have divorced separated or reformed and more ethnically sensitive services dorit braun of parentline plus expresses concern about the number of children who run away from stepfamilies jealousy of a parents new partner can fuel conflict between children and adults in stepfamilies she says many children do adjust well but a small minority dont the young people and the adults in a stepfamily need to be given time to understand each other the dynamics of a stepfamily are much more complex than those in an intact family and stepparents can be viewed by children as interfering and making a difficult situation worse the government has highlighted a small project in gloucester called astra alternative solutions to running away which employs just three parttime workers as a model of good practice the project works with young people who have run away to prevent recurrences staff listen to young peoples concerns and then try to work with them their parents and other agencies such as schools and social services to find solutions with which both the young people and their parents or carers are happy police estimate that the project has reduced the number of repeat runaways by one former runaway sally says the project has helped her resolve a difficult situation with her mother my mum didnt like my friends the way i dressed or the fact that i wore makeup and she didnt like me going out one day i just didnt go home from school i was scared because i didnt know where i could go in the end i stayed at a friends house astra talked to my mum and talked to me now she gives me a bit more freedom i understand her better and she understands me better now that marie is settled in london studying for a university degree and living in a flat that a childrens societysupported tenancy project helped to secure for her the days of trudging around the capitals west end with nowhere to go seem very far off i love my home she says ive got my own front room my own bedroom a cat friends and a normal life i dont ever want to go through what i went through again and if young people

suddenly a crucial issue is back on the agenda equal pay an equal opportunities commission eoc taskforce reported last month yesterday the employment minister tessa jowell responded by announcing a pay audit of every government department and agency with each being required to draw up plans to close the pay gap she set out plans for the appointment of fair pay champions from the business and trade union world to promote pay equality and confirmed there would be annual castle awards named after barbara castle who steered the equal pay act through the commons for employers who have made major progress towards closing the gap what more some may ask could women want quite a lot yesterdays package falls pathetically short of what is needed as the eoc report confirmed the uk has the worst record in europe on equal pay a gap of between the earnings of men and women it calculated that between one quarter and one half of this gap was a direct cause of discrimination the rest being caused by occupational segregation of women workers being in the lowest pay categories like catering retail and cleaning and a high concentration in parttime work the act has achieved progress a narrowing of the pay gap from in to and an increase from one third to one half of working age women in employment yet at all levels of society unequal pay perniciously persists millions of women who carry just as much responsibility as male counterparts are being paid much less business was given years to correct this unacceptable practice but failed the eoc was right to insist that employers should be required to carry out mandatory pay audits and ministers were wrong to reject it of course there are good employers but there is also a hardcore of hardliners who will not be moved by exhortations to carry out voluntary audits the public service one of the worst offenders should have been ordered to follow the eoc line it took a year fight through the european court before speech therapists forced the nhs to put things right other groups are still awaiting justice once again ministers have been too eager to secure the business vote this was political madness women voters have

its so cold on the streets and so frightening says marie a yearold student who ran away from a birmingham care home just before she was she felt that she had no choice but to run away because the stepfather who had sexually abused her as a child which led to her going into care in the first place kept following her he would appear and sit next to her as she sat on the bus to school and hang around the care home when i was he was jailed for the abuse for a while but it was all over the papers and everyone knew what he had done to me she says in the end i couldnt stand it and felt the only thing i could do was run away she finished her gcses took a job washing up in a restaurant for three weeks to save enough money for a train ticket to london and then ran the worst thing was that no one would listen to me she recalls i was scared and nervous when i got on the train but i felt i couldnt go back to the situation i had left behind kids will only run away if the situation they are in is so bad that living on the streets seems like a better option something has got to be really wrong to make a young person do a thing like that marie was so terrified when she arrived at euston station that she simply walked the streets for three days too frightened of what might happen if she lay down and closed her eyes i felt so alone in the world she says nobody in my care home bothered to report me missing the streets are full of homeless young people crying out for love marie was one of an estimated young people who run away each year the commonest reasons for children taking flight include desperation at not being listened to rows with parents over the amount of freedom they are allowed bullying at school and drug problems or abuse at home a new paper from the social exclusion unit consultation on young runaways highlights the problem and puts a variety of solutions to the problem out to consultation by the age of one in nine children will have run away for at least one night with a quarter of those ending up sleeping rough some have to survive through begging stealing or prostitution and many are sexually abused on the streets while children like marie who have been in care make up a large proportion of runaways approximately four in the report finds that are fleeing stepfamilies and oneparent families compared to who live with both birth parents but contrary to stereotype poverty was found not to be a significant factor leading to young people running away those from leafy suburbs are just as likely to flee as those from deprived innercity areas the majority of runaways are aged between and and are more likely to be girls than boys although boys tend to run away earlier and more often it is not only a problem of troubled adolescence an estimated children under also run away each year of whom about a third are under eight shockingly a further children a year are thrown out by their parents the report also notes that the longer runaways are away the more vulnerable they become there is no national network of services in place so emergency organisations like childline find it very hard to refer children who phone in a crisis to appropriate local services the report proposes a series of measures both to prevent young people from running away in the first place and to provide decent support services when they do plans include an interview for each young person who has run away to identify the reasons for fleeing and to try to tackle them rather than just dumping the children back in the situation from which they have fled a network of refuges so that young people are not forced to live rough and the establishment of a named person in each area to coordinate services for runaways chris now ran away from numerous care placements about times he believes that refuges are essential but also that fundamental changes in the care system are necessary i was frightened on the streets he recalls but i also felt free i shoplifted to survive i received no support in care nobody listened and i was bullied for me living on the streets was better than that much of the data in the governments new report comes from research carried out by the childrens society which has been working with young runaways for the past years the charitys penny dean welcomed the report but is urging the government to implement some of the proposals such as providing children with interviews right away rather than await the outcome of the threemonth consultation process a social exclusion unit spokesman has responded that this would not be possible i really hope the government wont delay over this says dean young runaways are a very hard to reach group who need a lot of support a lot of these young people view statutory agencies with mistrust and we need a mechanism to draw together expertise from the voluntary sector to deliver the services young people want she condemns the lack of funding for refuges centrepoint in london is the only one in britain and argues that although the concept of childrens refuges was established in the children act the money to run them has not been forthcoming from the government without such refuges there is no safety net to protect children from the dangers of the streets besides the government recommendations the childrens society is calling for more early intervention to prevent running away support and mediation for parents and children where families have divorced separated or reformed and more ethnically sensitive services dorit braun of parentline plus expresses concern about the number of children who run away from stepfamilies jealousy of a parents new partner can fuel conflict between children and adults in stepfamilies she says many children do adjust well but a small minority dont the young people and the adults in a stepfamily need to be given time to understand each other the dynamics of a stepfamily are much more complex than those in an intact family and stepparents can be viewed by children as interfering and making a difficult situation worse the government has highlighted a small project in gloucester called astra alternative solutions to running away which employs just three parttime workers as a model of good practice the project works with young people who have run away to prevent recurrences staff listen to young peoples concerns and then try to work with them their parents and other agencies such as schools and social services to find solutions with which both the young people and their parents or carers are happy police estimate that the project has reduced the number of repeat runaways by one former runaway sally says the project has helped her resolve a difficult situation with her mother my mum didnt like my friends the way i dressed or the fact that i wore makeup and she didnt like me going out one day i just didnt go home from school i was scared because i didnt know where i could go in the end i stayed at a friends house astra talked to my mum and talked to me now she gives me a bit more freedom i understand her better and she understands me better now that marie is settled in london studying for a university degree and living in a flat that a childrens societysupported tenancy project helped to secure for her the days of trudging around the capitals west end with nowhere to go seem very far off i love my home she says ive got my own front room my own bedroom a cat friends and a normal life i dont ever want to go through what i went through again and if young people

the coincidence of the two events could not have been more poignant last thursday morning the prime minister launched a new drive to protect runaway children in the afternoon a team of child specialists who had run the children societys refuge for runaways in leeds met for a farewell party following its closure late last year where once there were four refuges for such children now there is only one centrepoint in london the stark statistics in last weeks report from the social exclusion unit seu set out the dimensions and the risks by the age of one in nine children has run away for a night most find a temporary home with family or friends but sleep rough suffer physical harm and sexual assault one in ends up surviving through begging stealing drug dealing or prostitution runaways as exasperated charity workers have noted are everybodys concern but nobodys responsibility they fall through the welfare net crossing geographical as well as service boundaries but now a national strategy with downing streets backing is promised there is delight at the childrens society which has campaigned on the issue for years but will the new consultation process still further delay developments which ought to be happening now we do need a national network of services for runaways but we need a preventive strategy too four out of five run because of problems at home parental conflict physical or sexual abuse most want to go back but with the conflict resolved childline can help but it needs more childcentred agencies to which it can refer callers wider provision of school support mentors peer groups counsellors is one front more child advocates and family mediators are other options we need more flexible safe places refuges yes but they are incredibly expensive emergency foster homes and even bampb with foster carers could help postrunaway services can stop repeat runners these include family group conferences mediation plus independent interviews by child advocates whitehall also needs to look at why we have had to wait so long the initial refuges were set up by bending the law technically the childrens society could have been prosecuted for harbouring runaways this was changed by the children act but still no statutory refuges emerged nor state funds for charitable refuges state agencies did not refer the children ipso facto no state money it was absurd they were unsustainable without state aid children continued to turn to them only when the last two announced closure was one saved as tony blair noted we must find a better

the government today announced plans to appoint fair pay champions in an effort to combat the growing wage gap between men and women tessa jowell the employment minister wants uk companies to sign up for a voluntary audit of their pay practices in a bid to beat gender inequality that leaves women earning an average of less than men the government took the initiative by setting a two year deadline to reform practices across the civil service however the scheme backs away from statutory legislation and instead plumps for a system of voluntary regulation the appointments are expected to come from the worlds of business and trade unions and the equal opportunities commission will be given to launch a campaign julie mellor chairwoman of the eoc said at long last the issue of unequal pay is being brought out into the open business groups welcomed the announcement but other campaigners said that they would prefer legislation to force firms to act ms jowell told a london conference that women were still losing out in the labour market having less responsibility lower pay and fewer promotion opportunities discrimination is still sadly one of the factors she said women are still discriminated against at work because too often the culture is hostile and discriminatory ms jowell said the pay gap was stark and that any gap driven by discrimination was too high the government had

heard the one about the female secretary who slept with her boss and hey presto she was promoted the truth is that its men who are more likely to sleep with their superiors to secure promotion at work according to a new survey by online recruitment agency planetrecruit of the men questioned said they would have sex with their boss if it would get them a higherstatus job while less than a third of the women said they would do so the survey which reveals the lengths office workers will go to get ahead at work also found that of men said they would be happy to resort to character assassination to secure better jobs whereas only of women said they would whats more twice as many men as women were happy to take credit for some one elses work this doesnt mean that women are less manipulative however far more women than men claims the report are prepared to moan to win the bosss sympathy vote the report shows very clearly that women feel more comfortable employing less obvious or more underhand career enhancing tactics than men says its author megan hayes if shes found to have done something wrong at work shell play the oh but things are so hard at home card or shell keep making comments about how shes not being challenged enough in her environment in the hope of getting a better job says hayes nevertheless as other research shows women are more likely than men to shoot themselves in the foot when offered the chance to prove theyre ready for promotion our study found that women are far more likely than men to underrate their own performance at work this could be one of the reasons that women find it harder than men to get promoted says haihai yuan coauthor and researcher at gallup organisation the chief reason that more women than men are willing to devalue themselves is because of lack of confidence in their own abilities found the report this comes as no surprise to debra allcock author of high flying who trains women to be more assertive at all levels of organisations typically they tend to measure themselves in terms of what they cannot do rather than what they can as a result they think that they are less deserving not necessarily than men are but than any other employee it doesnt help that women are more likely than men to take criticism as a sign that theyre inadequate says anne dickson author of women at work the stereotypical accusation that women cannot handle criticism at work and take it too personally is partly true she says the ability to respond to criticism without being wounded is easily undermined by our need for approval whether secretaries are male or female theres a growing body of advice on the best ways to ensure promotion exposure showing the right people how hard you are working and networking are increasingly crucial says beverley stone a corporate psychologist its about letting the right people know what you are doing what your plans are and that youre doing well she says after all in todays office there are more managers than ever who have a say in promoting secretaries fiona elsa specialist in training and development at ashridge management college believes that its worth asking as early as possible if a promotion route is mapped out for you if so ask to see your development plan if not ask how else you can best move up the ladder it will show your employer that youre keen to give your best to the company the best time to ask about promotion is at your annual performance appraisal max a eggert an appraisal specialist says secretarial staff are at a particular advantage when it comes to getting the best from appraisals most occur annually he says but throughout the year there should really be onetoones which are essentially mini appraisals ensuring that no progress is missed since secretaries are usually in charge of their managers diary they can just book in a halfhour slot once a month or so if youre turned down for what you think is a deserved promotion always ask why ask too what you can do to improve your chances next time round if the improvements mean training is required suggest a date to start it no ambitious secretary will hang around in a post where theres no

when teresa gorman stands down at the election her yellow jacket aimed to catch the speakers eye will be missed so will her double function as the sand in the parliamentary oyster as a radical feminist and hard right tory europhobe i never thought i mourn her passing after our first confrontation when i uncovered the fact that she had taken years off her age in to inherit in the safe tory

mrs gorman said its a fair cop her selectors gullibility was understandable she showed the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy of which she is a prime defender as st teresa of the menopause

economic libertarian opposed to any official nannying she also claimed that she was the victim of a titfortat political campaign as the feminist daughter of an irish building worker she also detests middle class idiots particularly if they are also male chauvinist pigs she declared herself the enemy of the old wet tories who think they were born to rule her europhobe rebellions provoked her chief whip to want to exile her to the falklands in she deserted john redwood as a badmannered insensitive snob whose remarks on single mothers were a disaster dismissed william hague as a willie and voted for europhile ken clarke it was an example of a bright woman who considers every subject on its merits as gerald kaufman confirms typical of her independence is her rejection of accepted wisdom about global warming as a biologist with a first class honours degree from london university she prefers blaming sunspots her militant feminism made her part of the bipartisan commons feminist sisterhood

equal pay tsars will shame sexist employers into giving women a fair wage under a government action plan to root out workplace discrimination ministers will stage an annual summit to review the progress made for working women at which poor performers will be expected to explain why they pay their female workers less than males meanwhile leading figures from the arts trade unions and business will be appointed as fair pay champions within their industries however employment minister tessa jowell who is to unveil the package on tuesday is likely to come under fire from equal opportunities watchdogs for rejecting their demands for mandatory pay audits or for a change in the law the equal opportunities commission wants employers to be forced to review the salaries of all staff and publish findings exposing any discrimination but ministers have rejected the idea which risks antagonising the business lobby arguing that the pay gap is not only caused by sexism but also by women choosing or being steered into lowpaid and lowskilled jobs jowell will say these are practical problems requiring practical solutions not more legislation an per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable even an per cent pay gap is totally unacceptable any pay gap driven by discrimination is totally unacceptable she will say the government will be working in partnership with business and the trade unions to make sure that the next ten years will be a decade for women in work a decade in which the employment opportunities for all women will improve and in which the unfair unacceptable and unlawful pay gap will be closed women currently earn only per cent of mens rates for equivalent work although the gap has closed since when women on average earned p for every pound taken home by a man in the same job experts argue that years of antisex discrimination laws have failed to close it and that more drastic action is needed recent research by the womens unit in whitehall exploded the myth that women earn less simply because they have family responsibilities showing that even childless females can expect to earn more than less than men in the same jobs over their lifetimes jowells plan will focus on parttime workers for whom the gap in hourly pay is even wider and women returning to work after having children new mothers on average see their hourly pay fall by up to per cent when they go back partly because employers may assume they are no longer as committed to careers and partly because many go back to slightly different jobs the network of pay champions will spearhead a public campaign making it unacceptable to give women workers a poorer deal jowell will organise a yearly summit the first of which is expected later this year for business and the unions at which progress will be reviewed and poor performers identified they will then have questions to answer said a source at the department for education jowell will also confirm plans to streamline employment tribunals making it easier for women to sue for sexual discrimination there is likely to be an advertising campaign to ensure that women are aware of their rights polls show four in women are not aware they are entitled to time off in a domestic emergency for example the eoc will get a grant to encourage voluntary pay audits at work the watchdog has argued that as long as employers are not

who believes in equality even the communists were more preoccupied with the dictatorship of the proletariat than achieving genuine equality most liberals content themselves with the ronald dworkin proposition that their obligation is to argue for a government that will redistribute rather than do anything themselves this is a value that few beyond the monastery are prepared to live out this lack of belief in equality is starkly exposed by what has happened to women in the years since the sex discrimination and equal pay acts became law sadly not much as this weeks white paper on equal opportunities will doubtless declare the bald fact remains on average women earn per cent less than men worse as a rash of recent employment tribunal judgments has exposed sexist attitudes and intimidatory and harassing behaviour are still rampant in the workplace the accounts especially from the city should make even the most committed convert to the belief that girls are on top pause widespread talk of dogs and slappers taunts about why womens relationships might be going wrong their being passed over for promotion the casual assumption that their prime purpose is to be slept with their being ignored at meetings this is not a portrait of sexual equality but of pernicious discrimination against this background worries about men and their psychological problems about adjusting to a new environment in which women win all the prizes are laughable men have plenty of problems and it is true that conceptions of being the warriorprovider are dying but that doesnt mean that it has ceased to be a mans world its become a mans world in a different way men dominate the old institutions of power ranging from the judiciary to the boardroom and they dominate the new institutions of power ranging from the media to the informal networks of the ict revolution during the last couple of months ive attended two weekend conferences at one with some attending there were no women at the other of some journalists there were only two the old feminist charge that the informal networking and informationgathering options open to men are in a different league from those available to women seems never more true what is shocking is that so much of this is accepted without public protest too many women take the view that if they kick up a fuss they might damage their career and that their best approach is simply to be very good at what they do and be one of the boys results should speak for themselves the trouble is that results dont count as much as they should and being one of the boys validates attitudes that should have gone out with the ark given the tradeoffs obstacles and deep cultural perhaps even biological imprinting of women its difficult to criticise or complain about any individual womans choice but we all end up losers work is impoverished by gender stereotyping the lack of a critical mass of senior women from whom the next generation of organisational leaders can be recruited means that the poverty of womens representation becomes selfsustaining poor pay and inadequate promotion while at a junior level the male temptation to see their female colleagues as sisters of the lapdancers they pay to ogle is not counteracted some tough nettles have to be grasped the structured inequality women confront is so entwined with male attitudes towards the erotic and sexual that instruments like the sex discrimination act seem puny at its rawest both sexes expect women to be the prime carer of children and for the erotic to depend on women pleasing men out of this maelstrom comes sys temic economic and social inequality it isnt as bad as it was both sexes are learning that equality is a better route to mutual sexual pleasure than inequality and this must surely ultimately cascade into more equal economic and social relationships but before that can happen the next massive bar is motherhood as my colleague at the industrial society richard reeves argues in his pamphlet mothers versus men it is a taboo to state the obvious as long as women take the prime responsibility for bringing up children then it is rational for employers to pay this group of workers at a discount because they take more time off work and sometimes when their child is ill at inconvenient and unpredictable moments it is only when parenting is equally shared and is an equally unpredictable cost to both men and women that the rational calculus will change in the meantime it is hardly a surprise that most women chief executives and directors are childless the prime barrier is the view that warriorprovider men and nestbuilding women are incapable of sharing parenting if this is true ive come round to the opinion that we might as well give up on other battles over equality in last weeks special observer magazine britain uncovered tim adams argued that the growing realisation that we are now living in close proximity to so much incredible wealth has become psychologically destabilising our ordinariness becomes a source of disaffection and we want to do something dramatic to interrupt the pattern of our lives the scale of inequality in income and wealth pollutes our capacity to be at ease with ourselves i think adams is right but there is little possibility of assembling a political coalition to do anything unless we take the case for more equality more seriously but that seems improbable if we cannot crack sexual inequality as conservative newspapers know without being told every headline asserting that working mothers never working parents damage their children in some way is another blow against the progressive argument in its totality you make women guilty entrench sexual inequality and hold back the wider case for more equality which is why the old aphorism that the personal is political is as true as ever but for personal interventions to work you need a legislative and cultural framework to support you in that sense next weeks white paper is an important moment its taken four years but at least the government is offering a signal that sexual equality matters the big question is whether enough men are prepared to listen and

a national network of safe houses to accommodate the thousands of young people under the age of who run away from home is to be created under proposals outlined by the government the idea is one a series of social exclusion unit initiatives aimed at stepping up provision for the youngsters who flee family problems bullying or drug problems each year the government admits there is inadequate support for most runaways who are given little help in tackling the problems which made them run away the problems have been exacerbated by the closure of refuges for young people in leeds london and cardiff now there is just one in central london which provides just five places the unit also proposes setting up teams of special advisers to counsel runaways and drawing up a national runaways strategy to drive up standards of services across the country launching the report the prime minister tony blair said better ways had to be found of tackling the issue of runaways we have to make it less likely that young people run away in the first place and if they do run ensure their immediate safety the report says although most young people who leave home do so only briefly a quarter sleep rough and one in survive through begging drug dealing and prostitution ian sparks chief executive of the childrens society said it means that in future years these children will have safe alternatives

professional women are for the first time making up the majority of volunteers overseas but rarely get the opportunity of a foreign posting in their regular careers according to an investigation of gender prejudice by the international development charity vso it found the number of women volunteers signing up for service abroad has trebled over years reflecting womens higher qualifications and changing patterns of family life last year vso had women working abroad and men but women took only of international assignments in companies that commonly regarded overseas experience as a key factor in deciding promotion according to research for vso by hilary harris director of research at cranfield universitys school of management she said the vso experience exploded myths about women that were damaging their career prospects by denying them the chance to work abroad there are three very potent assumptions first that women are not interested in posts abroad second that family ties prevent them accepting posts abroad and finally that women sent on overseas assignments are doomed to fail in the face of prejudice in certain countries yet the vso figures offer evidence not only that women are interested in challenging postings overseas but that they thrive when given the opportunity to do so she said we have to ask by denying women such experience have we created a new glass ceiling women make up of middle management but represent just of all chief executive officers an nop poll commissioned by vso found of women would like the chance to work overseas but more than of women and men thought it was harder for women to gain respect in some foreign cultures more than of women and men said it was difficult for women to take up posts abroad because of family commitments and nearly half said it was harder for women to work abroad than men vso said these public attitudes contrasted sharply with the evidence of its returning women volunteers most of the women volunteers were in their twenties and fifties the older volunteers said they were prompted by freedom from family ties an urge to see the world and travel with a purpose the younger volunteers saw vso as a boost to

gender prejudice by the international development charity vso it found the number of women volunteers signing up for service abroad has trebled over years reflecting womens higher qualifications and changing patterns of family life last year vso had women working abroad and men but women took only of international assignments in companies that commonly regarded overseas experience as a key factor in deciding promotion according to research for vso by hilary harris director of research at cranfield universitys school of management she said the vso experience exploded myths about women that were damaging their career prospects by denying them the chance to work abroad there are three very potent assumptions first that women are not interested in posts abroad second that family ties prevent them accepting posts abroad and finally that women sent on overseas assignments are doomed to fail in the face of prejudice in certain countries yet the vso figures offer evidence not only that women are interested in challenging postings overseas but that they thrive when given the opportunity to do so she said we have to ask by denying women such experience have we created a new glass ceiling women make up of middle management but represent just of all chief executive officers an nop poll commissioned by vso found of women would like the chance to work overseas but more than of women and men thought it was harder for women to gain respect in some foreign cultures more than of women and men said it was difficult for women to take up posts abroad because of family commitments and nearly half said it was harder for women to work abroad than men vso said these public attitudes contrasted sharply with the evidence of its returning women volunteers most of the women volunteers were in their twenties and fifties the older volunteers said they were prompted by freedom from family ties an urge to see the world and travel with a purpose the younger volunteers saw vso as a boost to career prospects and said they were attracted by the sense of adventure ruth lewis the charitys director of recruitment said here is evidence of a pool of female talent and ability waiting to be tapped not just by vso but by the wider business community,2001-03,professional woman first time making majority volunteer overseas rarely get opportunity foreign posting regular career according

if genius is the capacity for taking infinite pains then michael martin the first catholic speaker since the reformation is a genius despite sneers about his lowly glasgow origins and accent with two years of hard slog in the tearoom and some highly skilled tactical planning mr martin outclassed a dozen others the contest for the speaker his planning was illustrated by an incident in january when the first story emerged that betty boothroyd was thinking of standing down a group of labour mps were in australia on a parliamentary visit when one pretended that he would stand as a drastic reformer all but one of his colleagues promised to support him the exception said he could not back him because he was already part of mick martins campaign team this long planned campaign had tactical brilliance from the start mr martin recognised his own weakness as an orthodox rather oldfashioned roman catholic opposed to abortion and to lowering the age of consent for homosexuals he had been one of only six labour mps to voted against legalising homosexual sex at these two stands put him against new young women labour mps who universally backed both reforms two years ago he set about neutralising all these expected antagonisms by working the tearoom this meant cultivating new young women mps who would otherwise disagree with them helping in his genial fatherly way to solve their problems as new mps and congratulating them in handwritten letters on their maiden speeches when the speakership election finally took place in october not only was he flanked by young women mps on either side but he was nominated by ann keen the icon of the gay sex at brigade for having led the crusade the upshot of mr martins twoyear campaign was that he defeated all his opponents including the highlyqualified one nation tory sir george young for whom tony blair indicated his preference and for whom commons leader margaret becket parliamentary labour party chairman clive soley and dozens of other labour mps voted mr martin to beat this highly articulate old etonian by to virtually all the tory mps abstained from the final vote to endorse him with eight even voting against him although this risked being ignored when in the future they wanted to catch his eye and speak in debates their hostility was an expression of classbased detestation towards glaswegian machine politics this was echoed by journalists who recalled his role in barring hacks unaccompanied by mps from the commons riverside terrace an attractive place on warm summer evenings michael martin emerged from the lost generation of labour mps so tagged by former prime minister james callaghan who were elected in just as the tories took over for years he represents springburn the safest labour seat in glasgow with among the highest concentration of council housing in britain its inhabitants are mostly poorlypaid and the number of its unemployed is among glasgows highest mr martin shared his constituents background his father was a merchant navy stoker his ship was torpedoed three times during the war his mother a school cleaner had to bring up five children on her own after her husbands death mr martin himself had to leave st patricks boys school at to start an apprenticeship at a local trainrepairing workshop he moved on to become a sheetmetal worker at rolls royce aero engines becoming an auew shop steward it was as a union organiser for nupe that he got into his political stride in congratulating him on his election as the speaker charles kennedy leader of the lib dems recalled when mr martin had organised a very welcome nupe strike at young charless school in mr martin was elected to glasgow corporation and to glasgow district council the next year in he was selected to replace richard buchanan as the candidate for springburn once in the commons the closest he got to power was as parliamentary private secretary to denis healey in he failed to shine as a parliamentary orator and was never promoted to labours front bench instead he made his way up the parliamentary ladder dutifully serving on committees he earned brownie points as chairman of the administration committee organising childcare vouchers for the commons staff after serving for years on the chairmens panel he became deputy speaker in this whetted his appetite for the top job as speaker he has started by being tough cutting short wordy mps if they cannot formulate an intelligent question within a minute he even invited one tory john butterfill to leave the chamber when he challenged the speaker

there was a game they used to play at the bank where sue temple worked every morning when she walked in her male colleagues would try to guess what underwear she had on camisole they would yell or french knickers one of women brokers among men she would pass the bank of desks while its occupants crouched and craned to verify their guesses it was like a building site she says only all the blokes were wearing suits the gap between modern standards of behaviour and those practised in the city widened again last week when the japanese finance house nomura paid out to isabelle terrillon one of its former brokers terrillon returned from maternity leave three years ago to find that her job no longer existed at a tribunal in stratford east london she described nomura as the kind of place in which a male colleague would declare loudly enough for her to hear that of all the women on the dealing floor the one he really wanted to fuck was isabelle during a client meeting terrillon said she was asked to strip down and administer a massage to one of her colleagues if she showed displeasure she was asked whether or not she was going to start crying last monday she dropped the sexual discrimination claim and accepted a outofcourt settlement for unfair dismissal behaviour in the city is traditionally graded between the extremes of yobbish brokerage and genteel corporate finance brokerage it is imagined is a gladiatorial arena in which everyone is mean to everyone else while corporate finance is a euphemism for gentlemanly according to women who have worked in both however it is not the degree of sexism that differs so much as its expression which by subtle means is as alive now as it was during the s over the past five years the equal opportunities commission has taken on cases of sex discrimination from workers in the city six of which have been successful many of them settle before they get to court says a spokeswoman who believes that these figures are a drop in the ocean most city males think the world is divided into three types of women says one former analyst the sweet virginal julia roberts lookalike who responds with delighted giggles to any sort of perfectly normal workplace banter yet is desperate to don crotchless knickers and give the boss a blowjob then there are the mothers unreliable because not only did they go and get pregnant but they have the nerve to clock off early if a child breaks an arm and then there is the largest group of women the humourless bitches for years helen cartwright was a money broker for an international swiss bank one of six women among men she earned a year it was like a cartoon she says the men in the office would say when are you going to go home get married and have babies the more they put me down the better they were regarded by the others on the off chance that they would get lucky cartwrights male colleagues would book rooms by the hour at london hotels such as the strand palace or the great eastern hotel and try to persuade her to return there with them on one occasion a male colleague approached cartwrights desk undid his flies and exposed the stitches of his recent circumcision to her she told him to put it away or she would hit it with the phone the nastiest thing they ever did was when i split up with my exhusband they talked very loudly about the new girl he was seeing it was devastating i lost a stone and a half in two weeks cartwright eventually left the bank and received an outofcourt settlement on the condition that she never disclosed its value these were not the sort of circumstances into which laura browning imagined she was entering after leaving a relatively civilised us company she joined a more traditional british merchant bank as a middleranking executive if id had a tape recorder i could have taken them to the cleaners she says i had a very swashbuckling client who required long meetings late into the night and at weekends during one meeting this man cleared a boardroom of people by saying could all of you please leave while i speak to linda once they had left he actually chased me round the boardroom it was unbelievable part of me wanted to laugh the other to slap him when the client persisted in commenting on daviess clothes and tried to grab her again she took the matter to a senior director my dear he said did no one ever tell you the customer is always right the subtext says davies was that if the client wanted to sleep with her then she should let him i went straight to a headhunter and said get me out of here this kind of overt grappling has been replaced recently by more covert forms of intimidation much favoured by litigationweary bankers it is about the subtle discounting of ability says helena dennison chair of the city womens network which represents senior female executives working in the square mile covert discrimination means rubbishing a womans contribution during meetings either with snide remarks or remarks about her appearance covert discrimination undermines confidence the language of sexism grows more respectable the further up a company you go becomes more subtle and harder to censure when she worked on the trading floor cartwright says women were referred to as tarts slappers and dogs in a funny way i think overt sexism is easier to deal with says a former analyst who worked in a us firm for five years what i experienced was a constant undercurrent which without anyone saying it ensured that women knew their place it was clear that only attractive females were being hired there was an atmosphere of testosterone which meant clients were taken to lapdancing clubs places where women would be uncomfortable every morning her boss would walk past his secretary and say show me your tits one morning after months of this she did he never asked again there was an underlying feeling that you would never get on you only had to look at the number of female executives to know that you had no future while the average intake in a city firm is divided equally between the sexes only of executives at the highest level are women according to the equal opportunities commission women working fulltime in banking and finance currently earn of their male counterparts earnings sexism is more dangerous now says justine burgess who used to work in international equity when her boss pulled her on to his knee or massaged her shoulders when she was on the phone to a client she found it relatively easy to diffuse i could laugh it off she says the men used to get their willies out but youd just learn to put up with it says sue temple you deal with it because everyone is in the same boat there was no point complaining women had to take it on the chin what is more difficult says burgess is an environment in which you get fewer daily comments but a lot of subtle discrimination over promotions and pay one of her friends has just filed suit against a merchant bank after being passed over for promotion because she suspects she couldnt play golf she was out of that whole guy thing and although she brought in as much revenue as the rest of them they froze her out dennison believes many woman dont take their grievances to court for fear of gaining reputations as troublemakers if you were making a year would you jeopardise your career by speaking out against the firm deutsche bank which last year paid an estimated in damages to a female banker after her manager publicly accused her of sleeping with a male client could not despite numerous requests rustle up anyone to discuss its harassment policy one analyst said the problem with these places is that they dont take their human resources departments seriously they see them as a service rather than a critical part of the company most of her female colleagues she says look straight past toothless personnel sections to the courts for redress against the odds isabelle terrillon has found another job in the city laura browning after a dehumanising spell on the trading floor left to write financial thrillers temple gave as good as she got for seven years and now practises as a healer in brighton justine burgess had

blair babes is just a casual misogynist tag that identifies only the lazy prejudice of its users the mirrors paul routledge is a typical sneerer when ranting in this weeks issue of the house the commons magazine he scorns miss jobsworth southeast who asks the prime minister patsy questions from the floor if the blair babe manages to stagger to the end of the sentence which the whips have thrust in her hands its a minor miracle infuriated by this constant slur fiona mactaggart mp did a survey and found no evidence that women ask more patsy questions than men but in that beligerent chamber on wednesday afternoons the sketch writers snooze through the plentiful mens sycophantic and inept questions waking to sharpen their pens only for the bright jackets of the women women are funny at the end of four years have the women occupying of the labour benches made a difference two new academic studies tell the story one says in contrast to the view that new labour women mps have failed women women mps have made a considerable difference acting for women within and beyond parliament the other analyses their voting record and its findings will please the mocking press gallery first the bald facts paul cowley of hull university studying the figures finds that women mps of the intake were indeed obedient at first they were seven times less likely to rebel than male mps of the same intake as time went on they got a bit braver but were still twice as unlikely to rebel as the men does that make them craven lobbyfodder and a general waste of benchspace that depends on what you think mps are for is rebellion against your own party the emblem of backbench effectiveness voting against your own party is one way to claim political virility and independence but it doesnt get results fiona mactaggart wrote in her fabian pamphlet rebellion is always rare most mps would fail if rebellion was the test all the same the women mps behave differently why at they never formed a critical mass in the house of commons oddities still not the norm most complain bitterly of the thundering maleness of the place and its traditions the chamber is the part of the job most of them like least the grandstanding strutting bellowing they are less likely to judge their own effectiveness in terms of their theatrical performance confrontation seems to them an unproductive avenue to changing policy women in parliaments around the world tend to follow the same pattern of voting loyalty they do politics differently and perhaps better dr sarah childs of middlesex university in an academic study out shortly in parliamentary affairs probes beyond the bare voting statistics she interviewed new women mps shortly after their arrival in westminster in and again four years later and assesses what effect their arrival has had on politics did they make a difference she thinks they did only look at the budget to find their handiwork maternity pay child care parttime workers rights lone parents new deal and a score of other recent measures did far more for women than for men ask women mps and most will say we did that do you imagine they ask that gordon brown had babies on his mind when he came to power poverty yes in the abstract but without understanding that means women where are the manifesto commitments to most of the things that he has spent his money on it was ex single mother paymaster general dawn primarolo in a key but silent backroom post who required the treasury to calculate the gender effect of all its actions the last budget delivered an average for women and for men compared to women were not a central pitch back in but an afterthought and a disastrous afternoons photo shoot with the prime minister remember how tony blair forgot to appoint a womens minister at all calling harriet harman back in a hurry to add it to her brief dr childs notes the changed selfconfidence in the mps since she first interviewed them most talk bitterly of their first blooding over the lone parent cuts brown pushed through some say it was their angry loyalty that gained castiron assurances that poor women and children would get the money back manyfold as recompense they list how they exerted power behind the scenes lobbying arguing writing reports bending ministers ears the higher proportion of women ministers made a difference women hold a third of ministerial posts the chancellor never meant to include lone parents in the new deal and it took long argument from harriet harman to persuade him child care was critical to poor mothers campaigning behind the scenes for maternity and parental rights was all done by women dr childss report suggests that in constituencies both women and men with problems find a woman mp more approachable their presence has significantly shifted agendas of the select committees the women claim they often work harder to get policy right in the first place rebels often scarcely notice an offending policy until it reaches the commons so did performers of the bob marshall andrews or dennis skin ner variety of mp get more done they may add to the gaiety of the nation but where is the beef women mps are of course not a homogeneous group these women only a half of whom call themselves feminists include regular rebels such as anne cryer and two cabinet ministers who have done everything to prevent changing the archaic and outrageous house of commons hours and customs margaret beckett and ann taylor betty boothroyd was no sister nor are many of the others who spit at being lumped together and yet overall there remains a generality of women who have a mission to press womens issues in a male legislature downing street mostly men has not fully understood the message of the womens political success nearly m more women than men will vote at the election and yet they are the ones who are most disaffected with labour fawcett societymori research shows women like women mps better and remember them more in elections parties remember this then they forget again if labour has made too little impact with its remarkable tranche of womens policies that is because they have been presented mainly by the men in the top jobs it is shocking that only three out labour held seats have selected women candidates this time as if the blair babes jibe had a lethal effect on local parties will the remaining seats all go to women or ethnic candidates in any lastminute selections dr childss research reveals women mps who are not obedient but effective unless you think noise and

frank furedi is not a relaxed parent he can be laidback about some things his fiveyearold son jacob is encouraged to play in the woods near their family home and furedi hopes he will soon be able to cycle to school but when it comes to illness furedi frets he worries about his sons health he can even quote you jacobs temperature when he was last poorly in short he is paranoid in common with all parents he maintains we all have our vulnerabilities our areas of concern our fears says furedi we all have something that can be played on and opened up and which then becomes the basis of fear in our parenting so furedi is on a mission he wants to make us aware of our paranoia so we can all cool it and be a bit more rational where looking after our kids is concerned thus the message of his new book paranoid parenting is stop listening to the experts tear up the handbook and follow your instincts where your child is concerned you know best of course there is a certain paradox to all this since furedi himself is a type of expert a sociologist at the university of kent and before you follow his advice never to read another parenting book he would love you to buy this one his ideas were formed he says after he became a father at the relatively advanced age of and discovered that parenting had changed rather a lot in the decades between his own boyhood and that of his son in particular what he noticed was that children were no longer left to their own devices he describes it as a colonisation of the world of children by adults as a consequence he says adults not only inhabit but control the lives of children to an alarming and unhealthy extent for furedi whose book the culture of fear examined the way risk is perceived in society the most obvious manifestation of this control centres on fears about childrens safety the real risks he argues are magnified by irrational fears and so kids freedom and creativity are being limited while jacob is encouraged to play outside the furedis home in faversham kent many children are kept indoors out of harms way but the harm furedi would have us believe is largely imagined yes we read a lot about child abduction murder and paedophilia but the risks to our own children from these evils are minuscule our fears are fed by study after alarmbellringing study alerting us to this or that childhood danger furedi disputes the idea that most of these studies originate in universities like his own in fact he says many are market research reports masquerading as more serious analyses the media are the villains of the piece and here there is a whiff of furedis past as a member of the revolutionary communist party whose magazine living marxism had an unerring instinct for controversy and an abiding contempt for the bourgeois press but the result he says is a generation of parents who believe that their children are at real risk and who are overreacting in their efforts to protect them when i ask people why they limit their childrens activities in a particular way says furedi they always say i couldnt live with myself if anything happened in other words theyre talking about themselves not about their children all this worry he believes is casting a shadow over family life take cot death for example furedi says that when he and his wife ann were expecting jacob the risks of cot death were often mentioned every mother i know admits to having worried at some point that their child is at risk he notes its emblematic of the campaign that weve created the effect of this climate of fear on parents is exacerbated by the fact that more and more is expected from them argues furedi take education todays parents are expected to be amateur teachers involved in every part of their childrens schoolwork its certainly not enough to leave it to the school i think that degrades education because it means politicians can ignore the problems of schools what im saying is that weve established this culture in which parents have a direct sense of responsibility for everything that happens to their children what this means is that weve lost our autonomy furedi thinks that because we now feel we have to take responsibility for every part of our childrens lives we take every threat to their safety too seriously its not worth altering your behaviour and being on red alert for what are relatively small risks he maintains weve got to accept that life contains risks and its far better to be aware of them than to let them enslave our lives the counterargument to all this is that todays parents are more knowledgeable about certain areas of parenting and more involved in their childrens lives than parents in the s and s but furedi is having none of this first he says it is naive to argue that the information we are being fed about say health risks in pregnancy is widening our choice or improving our parenting in fact they often lead to enforced conformity take the us where in some areas pregnant women can be arrested for drinking in public he says what begins as advice ends up as coercion furedi concedes that there may be a positive aspect to parents being more involved in the lives of their children but adds that the danger is it becomes compulsive what starts as involvement becomes this infinite process and you lose the ability to draw a line between what your children should be doing on their own and what adults should be doing furedi describes his own childhood he grew up in hungary in the s as a happy one despite a lack of material wealth and a father who had to work a hour week interestingly he admits that his mother who had survived imprisonment in a concentration camp was overprotective his own desire to be handsoff about jacobs upbringing and to persuade the rest of us to take the same approach is at least partly a reaction to that our own parents probably did a reasonable job given the constraints they were under and i dont think its helpful to criticise them furedi denies that he is harking back to a golden age when parents left their kids to get on with growing up and did not meddle so much although it is difficult to dismiss entirely the thought that somewhere inside he does believe that todays kids are worse off than previous generations what he says is that there is no model from the past for good practice in parenting every generation has to deal with the difficulties around it and do the best it can but the bottom line is if we stopped trying so hard we would make a better job of bringing up our kids and if we ignored most of the

frank furedi is not a relaxed parent he can be laidback about some things his fiveyearold son jacob is encouraged to play in the woods near their family home and furedi hopes he will soon be able to cycle to school but when it comes to illness furedi frets he worries about his sons health he can even quote you jacobs temperature when he was last poorly in short he is paranoid in common with all parents he maintains we all have our vulnerabilities our areas of concern our fears says furedi we all have something that can be played on and opened up and which then becomes the basis of fear in

a controversial new book on childrearing to be published this week will urge parents to let their children take more risks and stop panicking about playground bullies and paedophiles the books author frank furedi reader in sociology at the university of kent argues that parents obsession with the safety of their children is more damaging than the risks themselves paranoid parenting abandon your

the government is planning to scrutinise tax details to help it target employers discriminating against women over pay as part of a drive to tackle the continuing pay gap the employment minister tessa jowell is proposing trawling employers paye returns which reveal pay levels and are already categorised by gender the move devised by the new equal pay czar denise kingsmill would provide ministers with new information on pay inequalities including the occupations with the worst record on pay discrimination and blackspot regions it would also circumvent the need to obtain pay breakdowns directly from employers which businesses have claimedwould swamp them with bureaucracy the government said last month it would not bow to pressure to force employers to conduct gender pay reviews but would encourage companies to do so voluntarily unions and the equal opportunities commission are continuing to press ministers to legislate on the issue arguing that the worst offending businesses will otherwise continue to escape reform britain languishes at the bottom of the eu equal pay league thirty years after the passing of the equal pay act women working fulltime earn on average of male

of ideas we can build on to drive a culture change which both widen the range of womens work opportunities and confront discrimination and the pay gap the governments aim was to make sure a working

different all the same gender is commonly supposed to influence how they deal with their peers and subordinates but are there really any significant differences between working for a man and working for a woman moreover if there are how should you make the best of the situation if we are to believe dr john gray male and female bosses are worlds apart the author of the best selling selfhelp book men are from mars women are from venus writes at length about the differences he concludes that men are interested in objects and things whereas women are interested in people and feelings many dismiss this theory as inaccurate sexist nonsense angela ishmael head of the dignity at work community initiative at the industrial society says that what makes one boss different from another has much less to do with gender than management style and management style she argues is based on your bosss business sense and is independent of biology most of the convincing academic research in this field suggests that if anything male and female managers are more alike than dissimilar this finding was most recently confirmed in the edition of women in management current research the few differences that do appear to exist can be simplified dr sandi mann author of psychology goes to work and senior lecturer at lancaster university says that women tend to be more cooperative teamorientated and peopleorientated they are concerned about individuals and keen for everyone to participate men she says on the whole are less consultative and more authoritarian however points out dr mann these are sweeping generalisations and are by no means true of all men or all women richard branson has a reputation real or spun for a caring sharing collaborative relationship with his staff the same could hardly be said for margaret thatcher so for you the question is not how do you deal with a boss that is either male or female but how do you deal with a boss thats either democratic or at the other extreme dictatorial professor marilyn davidson of the manchester school of management at umist is considered something of an expert when it comes to these sorts of questions she offers the following advice for those who have a letsdothistogether boss dont try to get away with doing the minimum letting those around you do your work for you dont shrug off responsibility for yourself do take the initiative do get involved do ask for guidance if it is not forthcoming meanwhile for those who toil under a doasisay boss dont be arrogant dont be bolshie do open up the lines of communication do seek out opportunities for more work freedom do try to empower yourself in the office as best as possible remember that regardless of your particular boss just because you dont like

they were supposed to change the maledominated world of politics for ever but the socalled blair babes have had a battle on their hands even to survive fighting against blatant sexism and towering male egos to succeed in interviews for a new report female parliamentarians have attacked a macho culture in the commons accusing male colleagues of acting like prima donnas and getting their egos massaged by public displays of rebellion against the government at least two complained of sexual harassment in westminster such as name calling and obscene gestures while others said they feared promoting feminist causes could damage their careers the research conducted by politics lecturer dr sarah childs concludes that despite such obstacles the female parliamentary intake of has quietly made a major difference to the commons and to women voters lives it cites policies from crackdowns on domestic violence to better childcare and action against forced marriages as examples of female mps success arguing that many of their most notable successes such as watering down the asylum bill may never have been made public but childs whose paper will be presented to the political studies association conference in london later this month said she emerged with sympathy for the mps i was told they would be these terrible plastic politicians but i didnt think they were that kind of identikit shoulderpadded madeover women at all she said a lot of them were women who perhaps were firstgeneration higher educated and who were passionate about things like poverty and social exclusion they felt that they were set up to fail that they were expected to come in and make massive changes overnight which was completely unrealistic and that that has been hung around their necks they feel it was about misogyny in the press and that they couldnt win if you do something you are just acting like a woman and not looking after anyone else if you dont make a change thats because you are pathetic childs interviewed more than half of the labour women first entering parliament in repeating most of her interviews in the strongest response came from repeated public criticism that the new women mps were too scared to rebel against the government in votes as men did one said the difference with men was that we are not prima donnas while a second added we are committed to doing politics differently not to trashing people not to rubbishing people in public others said the macho thrill of voting against the government might be less likely to succeed than quietly buttonholing ministers to alter legislation and a fourth added women do their business differently they are not prone to getting up and talking if theyve got nothing to say they like to get things done rather than have their egos massaged however the paper warns that the women mps did not always succeed their protests over boxer and convicted rapist mike tyson coming to britain to fight were brushed aside by home secretary jack straw and one told childs the cosy image of a supportive labour sisterhood was misleading as they felt like a threatened species competing with each other to get on i would say that dog eat dog cat eat cat is just as strong if not stronger between the female fraternity of the house than the male she added the mass influx of labour women into parliament in fuelled by using allwomen shortlists to promote female candidates prompted initial euphoria but the atmosphere quickly soured with whispering that the female newcomers were too timid and asked patsy questions of ministers it culminated in labour backbencher brian sedgemore describing his female colleagues as obedient stepford wives childs concludes that the evidence shows the election of labour women mps to the house of commons has made a difference despite the criticism however the report suggests some female mps are less sympathetic to men with some reporting that male constituents had less genuine problems wanting to raise issues of principle rather than seek practical help gabyhinsliffobservercouk,2001-04,supposed change maledominated world politics ever socalled blair babe battle hand even survive fighting

q geri halliwell appeared in your election broadcast after your role organising the body image summit did it not feel slightly hypocritical to use someone who has shed so much weight in the past months a it was fantastic that geri agreed to take part in our party election broadcast shes talked openly about her bulimia and thats common knowledge what the body summit was about was asking the question why girls often outperform boys at school but then dont exploit their potential the summit pulled together experts in the field and got the issue on the front pages and despite some of the bile that event attracted it got people talking and eventually the reaction was really supportive but at the end of the day theres clearly a limited role for government in this area q theres been a lot of criticism levelled at the labour party that their election press conferences have had a token woman on the stage but isnt the real problem that there arent enough bighitting women around the cabinet table to begin with a theres been a woman minister on stage at every press conference bar two and so there should be as of the government is female people forget that of the cabinet if female we have women in key positions across the country estelle morris hilary armstrong patricia hewitt myself margaret jay are all coordinating the election effort across the country but i suppose the point remains that if you have the prime minister and the chancellor on the stage the most senior people in the country most people are going to put their questions to them q what about the role of ffion in the conservative campaign dont you think its demeaning that she is never allowed to utter a word a i think its extraordinary but i think thats a question youll have to put to william hague i think cherie is a huge asset to the labour party q what happened at wednesday mornings press conference there seemed to be a cockup about whether workers would have the right to flexible time working or not a what we announced yesterday is that new parents would have the right to request flexible working hours after they come back its the final element in our green paper proposals on helping parents combine work and family more comfortably q but its not a statutory right a its a right to request and a taskforce headed by george bains the former low pay commissioner will report in november the process will be worked through by mr bains and its important to give parents the legal right to ask q but its not a statutory right a its an entitlement what it will do is increase opportunities for working flexibly and secondly change the culture but theres no obligation on an employer to comply its one piece of the jigsaw that includes the working families tax credit statutory paid maternity leave statutory parental leave and many other measures what mum have told me all round the country is that they want flexibility and this will offer them that q but if in four years time employers havent taken part in this seachange will you make it statutory a its not a question for now thats a process for george bain to work through but what mothers tell us is its not a question of right to return parttime but a question of looking for the opportunity to work flexibly a nine day fortnight or for example three hour shifts and four days off q what about the minimum wage would you pledge to never decrease it during the next parliament no matter what the economic circumstances a well our key pledge at this election is to increase it to an hour certainly ive never been party to any discussion that even included your suggestion between m and m people have benefitted from the minimum wage and up to m of those are women thats something im very proud of the tories may be in support of the minimum wage now but they are latecomers to it before it was introduced they claimed it would destroy a million jobs q youre responsible for the new deal a lot of people criticise it as an expensive subsidy to get people off the dole queue and into burgerflipping jobs a the new deal is not a job creation scheme it gives the unemployed numeracy literacy it and people skills it is adjusted every six months it is permanent and it is to be extended to older longterm unemployed people youth unemployment would be twice the current level if it wasnt for the new deal so i find that an incredible accusation i have a responsibility to be sceptical about the new deal is it doing enough and new deal has changed the job market its shown its not good enough to just equip people with entry level skills they must be employable even when the job market isnt tight q you rightly or wrongly were labelled as the person who persuaded tony blair not to put an emphasis in the labour manifesto as promoting marriage as the ideal state is that true a ive never had a discussion with tony about marriage it certainly is the job of government to support families and married couples q nurseries what use is it to guarantee three year olds a nursery place if they live in rundown council estates or sprawling suburbia where there are no facilities what weve said is that every three year old will have a place by september if they want it thats m children places because some younger children only come in the morning or afternoon the neighbourhood childcare initiative has put daycare places into the most disadvantaged areas in britain new child minder places out of school hours places with m from the government so i just dont accept that point q how does it feel to be on the point of joining the cabinet in nine days time a im just working night and day for a mandate on june to continue what weve already started,2001-05,q geri halliwell appeared election broadcast role organising body image summit feel slightly hypocritical use someone ha shed much weight past month wa fantastic geri agreed take part party election broadcast shes talked openly bulimia thats common knowledge body summit wa wa asking question girl often outperform boy school dont exploit potential summit pulled together expert field got issue front page despite bile event attracted got people

the suffragettes chained themselves to the railings outside no to give women the vote to give them power we might have to resort to even more drastic measures naked hunger strikers surrounding millbank perhaps or guntoting feminists hijacking a concorde nothing else seems to work the election of women mps failed to give women clout so did the ministry for women cherie blairs principled stand on parental leave had some impact but even marrying off gordon brown to a successful professional sarah macaulay has failed to change the macho mood in politics in the beginning there was hope during the election labour had understood that if they wanted womens votes theyd have to have women in their ranks accordingly we saw and heard a lot of margaret beckett margaret jay tessa jowell mo mowlam harriet harman clare short and barbara follett trade union men who for so long had lent labour a decidedly masculine air were hushed and diluted promises of better childcare and parental leave wooed women voters the courtship worked women traditionally more likely to vote conservative switched allegiance to tony blair and then suddenly the honeymoon was over yes tony placed a few women in high positions and he delivered on childcare and parental leave as well as on the minimum wage which helped millions of women at the bottom of the earnings scale but the real power brokers were still brown mandelson campbell prescott men whose politicking was conducted over takeaway curries and beer as they watched football on the telly with the women blair seemed to be engaged in a different game a political version of the weakest link during which the gimleteyed dominator expelled harriet harman silenced mo mowlam and clare short snubbed barbara follett yes margaret jay led the house of lords but shes decided shes had enough of politics now and yes margaret beckett hovers in the wings but shes a reproach not a triumph this election has exposed the sad truth politics is still a mens game its the one theme that unifies the three main parties apart from cartoon caricatures such as the mummy and doris karloff the women have gone awol only one candidate in five from the major parties is a woman and there will be fewer in the next parliament echo research monitored mentions of individual politicians in national newspapers in their coverage of the first two weeks only one woman ann widdecombe appears in the top ten cherie blair whos kept a lower profile than during the election and ffion hague who dons blue smiles and has her husband answer questions for her have received five times the mention of any woman politician jackie ashley the political editor of the new statesman challenged gordon brown at his press conference last friday to explain why female ministers and party spokeswomen appear on campaign platforms only to keep mum however it is not just faces on a platform it is the issues that get discussed campaign coverage has concentrated on macho rows about europe tax and crime when all the evidence shows that these are the issues which make women switch off health and education are consistently ranked by women as more important little wonder that a mori poll revealed that during the past week the proportion of women who are certain or likely to vote has dropped from per cent to per cent feminists cant hide their disappointment as rosie boycott puts it we founded spare rib the campaigning feminist magazine years ago and since then a lot has changed for women but a great deal hasnt where are the improved childcare services why is there still a per cent pay gap between men and women at the lower income level tess kingham elected as one of the new labour wave of new women in is retiring as mp for gloucester after just one term she says she has found the commons a frustrating place to operate more alarmingly she has found that the culture there is a barrier to being an effective mp even so she has been effective a grassroots mp who successfully lobbied for millions to refurbish a local hospital for changes to the law on fire safety with a campaign for sprinklers that has gone international and for national screening for cystic fibrosis she also asked uncomfortable questions on arms trading the public are fed up with all that yahbooey stuff its ok for the public school oxbridge boys but its a turnoff for most people particularly women and the young she explains kingham had twins while in office looked after by a willing husband but denies this has been the main reason for her departure its wider than the childcare issue the chamber frustrated me it was difficult to speak and when people did it was little more than point scoring oona king is staying the course and seeking reelection as labour mp for bethnal green and bow in londons east end but is also worried people should be getting worked up about it she said yesterday there are so few of us in parliament that sometimes i look around the chamber during discussions and find im the only woman there king does not have a visibility problem in fact insiders talk of her as one of labours rising stars shes bright beautiful and black and just outspoken enough to make the media and her constituents feel shes a real person rather than an onmessage automaton when she came into parliament with the last intake she was only and unprepared for the masculine conventions of parliamentary politics parliament is based on seniority you dont get to the top jobs or even to ask questions unless you have held a senior position she said and by definition that keeps most women mps out of the power structure apart from the structure the very schedule of parliament is inimical to women with families or even as in kings case with a partner hes told me hes going to leave me if this carries on she says as we drive off to visit a constituent at a nearby council estate we drive in her renault clio along streets that are strewn with rubbish half the buildings are derelict welcome to my beautiful constituency she jokes and there is little sign of the urban renewal that has transformed neighbouring shoreditch i dont mind the work load but its from am to midnight and often were listening to eric forth debating whether there should be an ice cream van outside hyde park the denning point housing estate is a grungy tower block that plays host to crack gangs muggers and prostitutes this is according to jeannie whos come down from her eighthfloor flat to escort us through this shithole she points out a shabby prefab hut at the foot of the tower block where three bengali girls are playing its where they do the ayatollahs learning she barks king whos wearing a salwar kameez out of respect for the muslim family shell be visiting later gives me a wink jeannes mollified by her hug and by the way i recoil when she shows us the vomit and used condoms in the stairwell by the time we get upstairs to her flat and her husband bundu whos from sierra leone shes in high spirits oonas here she chirps while bundu fetches a bottle of taittinger champagne from the fridge who said champagne socialists only lived in islington king speaks of our problems and what we must do she links arms with bundu when he fills her champagne flute and puts her head close to jeannies for the photographer i recognise the tactic perfected by mowlam and short this is the woman politician casting off the deference and blurring the boundaries between personal and political showing the electorate that youre there for them always accessible improved public services more and better childcare the abolition of gender gap wage differential these are among the issues dear to women but at stake is something even more fundamental at a time when representative democracy is under attack from the ever more powerful corporate world and from public apathy politicians cannot afford to ignore the rights of half of the population to have a say in the decision making keeping women politicians mum will only keep women voters at bay and fuel our suspicion that the women who chained themselves to the railings of no got us a vote but not much else the moment that promised a new dawn if women were the only voters labour would have won just two elections since if only men voted neither ted heath in nor john major in would have been returned as prime ministers at the last election the swing towards labour was per cent among women and per cent among men a historic closing of labours gender gap women mps were elected at the last election current predictions are that will

television reports over the first half of the election campaign was female gordon brown was flanked by the equal opportunities minister margaret hodge and schools minister estelle morris at a press conference dubbed ladies day after male journalists decided to hold off questioning to ensure that women were called the effect was spoiled only when the chancellor clearly puzzled as to why the usual forest of besuited hands did not rise from the press seats butted in ahead of ms morris to answer a question on why so few women feature in the election campaign starting to contradict the suggestion he stopped short joining in reporters laughter labours nods to criticism that women are being marginalised in its campaign though less so than by other parties came as research by loughborough universitys communications research centre revealed that political wives are times more likely to feature in news reports than female politicians only of politicians appearing in election news items in the first week of the campaign were women the study found in contrast of politicians relatives featured primarily ffion hague who silently follows her husband as well as cherie blair and charles kennedys girlfriend sarah gurling are female maryann stephenson director of the fawcett society said the figures had not improved since the election people said that was because there were so few

oh why cant a woman by more like a man the facetious response to professor higgins in my fair lady would be because they are different however the professor is not alone in relating better to men than women and lamenting rather than accepting the differences between the sexes and that includes some interviewers youll hear it said that most interviewers make up their minds about candidates in the first seconds of an interview but in addition to this they may also treat male and female candidates differently according to recent research by city university interviewers not only use different criteria to judge male and female interviewees but the questions asked during the interview are sometimes phrased differently for men and women the purpose of the study was to assess the benefits of telephone interviews and how they compare with facetoface interviews the graduate milkround although well established is expensive and time consuming the researchers were keen to establish whether telephone interviews were an effective way of reducing the cost and time involved with selecting graduates for positions in a large multinational organisations the researchers taped interviews with applicants to a graduate training programme men and women the applicants were interviewed on the telephone and facetoface as part of the selection process and interviewers were asked to rate applicants after each interview the questions asked by the interviewer in both types of interview were noted and analysed the results of the study surprised jo silvester senior lecturer in organisational psychology at city university telephone interviews were rated lower overall but we found that male applicants performed better in telephone interviews while female applicants performed better in facetoface interviews she explains interestingly men were asked significantly more openended questions than women who were asked more closed questions particularly during the telephone interviews and the significance of this well openended questions provide more of an opportunity for an interviewee to talk and sell themselves men were more likely to be asked questions like how do you think whereas women tend to be asked do you think where the answer is simply a yes or a no if female applicants then proceeded to elaborate when asked a closed question they may be viewed as pushy explains jo the success of women in facetoface interviews could be because women tend to be more sensitive to and more dependent on interviewers nonverbal cues perhaps they are disadvantaged when these are removed hence their lower scorings in the telephone interviews the research suggests that in facetoface interviews women convey more control more acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to discuss difficult topics whereas men tend to focus on positive situations although the city study was a small sample and it is difficult to draw any conclusive findings jo has found similar results in another study she carried out which compared facetoface and telephone interviews of male and female solicitors at a large law firm in this study the results had also showed that women tended to be asked more closed questions compared to men at the time i thought that it was a one off but the findings from this research do suggest that men and women are treated differently during selection interviews christine fitzmaurice a psychologist at career psychology cautions against generalisations based on such a small sample there may be differences in the way in which male and female candidates are treated during interviews but this could be down a number of reasons for example the interviewer may simply be having a bad day that is why the interview should be just one part of a selection process which should also include group exercises and role play she says interviewer bias can be reduced by panel interviews where more than one person is involved both in the interview and selection process one of the advantages of panel interviews is that a recruitment decision will not be made on the preconceptions of one person says christine,2001-05,oh cant woman like man facetious response professor higgins fair lady would different however professor alone relating better men woman lamenting rather accepting difference sex includes interviewer youll hear said interviewer make mind candidate first second interview addition may also treat male female candidate differently according recent research city university interviewer use different criterion judge

blokes she said its all blokes glancing up at the election report on the tv screen in the pub alistair darling was saying something or other at the time and she and her friends turned away falling into that ninepoint satisfaction gap women are more dissatisfied than men with the government although younger women are more prolabour than young men they are less likely to vote at all still days to go labour still invincible and the campaign has reached that moment of ennui when it vanishes into a small dusty whirlwind of the westminster lobby oliver letwin who he said something off the record to the financial times about bn labour accuses the partisan press on the bus of alerting protesters to their leaders arrival the boys on the bus like reporting on themselves and their bus best dustups and fisticuffs are fun hunting keith vaz is good sport and allmale bareknuckle interviewers compete for killer punches this is indeed blokes stuff again for insider politicos only deborah mattinson independent polling consultant conducting focus groups for newsnight finds women far more disengaged than men they just dont enjoy the game she says this male aridity is the medias fault the politicians protest but that is only partly true last time great care was taken with labours focus groups to find out what warwick woman wanted this time gender blindness is back labour used to put a woman on every platform sitting there like dumb clucks but it was better than nothing anne widdecombe is the only woman featuring low down in the guardians soundbite count and the only woman to be seen apart from ffions grimly silent walkon lib dems punt up daily a silent baroness who sits there like a bolster but labour should know better the prime minister and the chancellor cant help being men but they could have campaigned better for women and children yesterday yvette cooper public health minister announced m for creches for nurses a necessity for recruiting staff but as a contribution to national childcare week it only acted as a reminder of labours biggest missed opportunity this government has done a great deal more than any other to provide childcare yet a recent poll showed the great majority of parents have never heard of the national childcare strategy it has not exactly tripped off the lips of the prime minister or chancellor each day large sums have been paid out a big programme is at last slowly rolling out and the number of childcare places is gradually rising the manifesto promises m children will have places by with one for every lone parent still not nearly enough for the m children under eight but an improvement in there was one place for every nine children under eight now there is one for every seven parents on basic rate can get a childcare tax credit of up to where before there was nothing so all this money is spent but there is no branding no message no election talk or understanding of its fundamental importance to families there is still ambivalence about whether it is a genuinely national strategy for all so far it is a strategy for the poorest though not all and for the richest who pay for their own now some a week in london but nothing for warwick woman the strategy suffers the classic problem of labours other social policies each local authority has an early years partnership which now finds it has to bid for money for creches and nurseries from an astounding different possible funding streams there are the early excellence centres for poor areas wonderful wraparound care education health and help for parents models of what every district needs by june all bids must be in for new neighbourhood nurseries though the difference between these two categories is not clear there are sure start programmes for deprived children not intended to provide childcare but now increas ingly finding that is the real need there are afterschool clubs which have nearly doubled in number under labour offering places though nowhere near enough for the m children under the myriad regeneration budgets take bids for nurseries as well as an alphabet soup of action zones with their own interests in babies even the home office recently funded nurseries discovering american research showing how every spent on nursery education saved in crime and social dysfunction later it is a muddle of a strategy but that it exists at all is entirely due to women ministers pushing it through persuading the chancellor that childcare saves money in the end if the government were more farsighted they would take this patchwork and weld it into a single promise there will be a childrens centre in every area there will be childrens palaces for every baby born with clinics toddler groups creches and nurseries afterschool clubs and adult training all under one roof they would be a symbol for labours social message making real to everyone who uses them what is happening to end child poverty improve education and ease the strain on families rich and poor using them together the day care trusts campaign is gaining ground their aspiration is for childrens centres the missing piece of the welfare state as urgently needed by ordinary families as by the poor electorally labour should have seized hold of this it will be expensive maybe as much as bn but it need not be promised all at once a rolling programme starting with the poor eventually reaching the leafy suburbs would take time it doesnt have to be free with fees affordable to each purse now this would have caught the imagination of the women who groan at the artificial jousting on their television screens as it is when nurseries and afterschool clubs do open the government will get scant thanks or recognition was it the local authority was it the lottery or a voluntary group it needs a single brand to make this a labour flagship etched into labours identity as firmly as the founding the nhs but the men at the top still think it something marginal so far the best things labour has done in its first term came not in their manifesto but long afterwards the promises to abolish child poverty bring full employment reach eu health spending levels so the radicalism or not of a second term has yet to be seen but why not a promise of universal childcare most of europe had decades ago readers can order a copy of did things get better an audit of labours

women are being held back in the race to become senior hospital doctors because of the working all hours culture that remains in the nhs a report suggested yesterday there needed to be a huge expansion in opportunities for consultants to work parttime or to job share far more outofhours hospital creches and an end to the assumption that a medical career required commitment at the expense of family life according to the three royal colleges of physicians based in london glasgow and edinburgh women first made up half of medical graduates years ago and should now be accounting for a substantial proportion of the doctors spending their next decade working towards the top jobs their report said but difficulties lay in their way two years ago women still made up only of consultants in medical specialities in hospitals the proportion in top jobs that combined clinical and academic roles was far lower men were also showing signs of throwing off the traditional career culture which could often mean continual training well into the late s the report said male junior doctors appeared to be more ready than women to consider a career outside hospital in medicolegal work with drug companies or in finance for example half the men as well as of women among young doctors questioned in a snapshot survey for the report suggested they might choose more flexible working patterns even though that could jeopardise their career progression the report from a working party of men and women concluded that government plans to increase the consultant workforce from to by failed to take into account the new mood among doctors well under of men consultants work parttime at present compared with nearly a quarter of women consultants the report did not call for positive discrimination but suggested that male old school attitudes still prevailed in hospitals baroness jay the former minister for women who attended the reports launch in london said nhs planners would have to take on board the conflicting demands for more flexible working and consumer pressure for a hour society we want to prevent this whole area reaching crisis proportions as it did in the recruitment and retention of nurses carol black professor of rheumatology who chaired the working party said the working lives of doctors will not improve without a substantial increase in the total workforce for now

women are being held back in the race to become senior hospital doctors because of the working all hours culture that remains in the nhs a report suggested yesterday there needed to be a huge expansion in opportunities for consultants to work parttime or to job share far more outofhours hospital creches and an end to the assumption that a medical career required commitment at the expense of family life according to the three royal colleges of physicians based in london glasgow and edinburgh women first made up half of medical graduates years ago and should now be accounting for a substantial proportion of the doctors spending their next decade working towards the top jobs their report said but difficulties lay in their way two years ago women still made up only of consultants in medical specialities in hospitals the proportion in top jobs that combined clinical and academic roles was far lower men were also showing signs of throwing off the traditional career culture which could often mean continual training well into the late s the report said male junior doctors appeared to be more ready than women to consider a career outside hospital in medicolegal work with drug companies or in finance for example half the men as well as of women among young doctors questioned in a snapshot survey for the report suggested they might choose more flexible working patterns even though that could jeopardise their career progression the report from a working party of men and women concluded that government plans to increase the consultant workforce from to by failed to take into account the new mood among doctors well under of men consultants work parttime at present compared with nearly a quarter of women consultants the report did not call for positive discrimination

victory was a long time coming for the dinner ladies who served meals to miners the national union of mineworkers began a legal campaign to get them equal pay with other surface workers such as maintenance men in twentyfour years later after numerous court cases culminating in the house of lords four years ago their claim has been settled with an offer to pay the women most of whom no longer work in the industry around for each year of service as compensation for discrimination by british coal four months after an equal pay task force reported that women in fulltime jobs are still paid on average per cent less than male counterparts the new government is going to have to decide what to do about the gender gap on pay or whether to do anything at all the strongest recommendation of the task force was that employers should be forced to carry out regular audits of pay to establish that they are not paying men more than women the government preferred a voluntary approach but didnt rule out legislation the task force claimed that discrimination employers paying men more than women for work of equal value accounts for between and per cent of the difference in pay other factors were occupational segregation stereotyping in the jobs men and women do and the unequal impact of womens family responsibilities and yet its report said the vast majority of employers do not believe they have a gender pay gap and therefore do not believe an equal pay review is necessary it concluded that equal pay audits would have to be statutory the equal opportunities commissions case histories include a seamstress in a nursing home who successfully argued that her work was as skilled as that of male colleagues doing carpentry and plumbing who earned or an hour more and a telecoms manager who discovered after two years that she was paid less than her male predecessor few deny that the pay gap persists between men and women but the extent to which it is caused by discrimination is contested dominic johnson the cbis head of employee relations says were not denying that there is discrimination out there but were saying that most research conducted on the subject is flawed and the conclusions misleading because it looks at pay at aggregate level rather than that of individuals working for the same employer at a comparable level he argues that feminised jobs may have lower pay because women dont push so hard over pay money is not such a dominant factor in how women rate a job as it is for men he says adding women also have weaker bargaining power because they are bargaining on more than one front as well as pay they are also negotiating flexible working and time off for their caring responsibilities when statutory equal pay reviews were introduced in ontario canada he says the discrimination detected was minimal and vastly outweighed by the cost of the reviews julie mellor chair of the equal opportunities commission ripostes that until employers carry out these reviews we dont have the data to see how much is down to discrimination in pay systems she says a pay review is the only way an employer can ensure it is complying with equal pay laws and adds the burden argument doesnt hold water when you relate it to the burden on individual women who are not paid fairly examples of employers who already carry out the type of thorough review envisaged seem to be elusive the eoc is committed to developing a detailed twostage model to show employers how to conduct an equal pay review the idea is that employers should be able to carry out a quick check to see whether they may be discriminating and only if they are will they need to get involved in a more lengthy process the model should be ready for employers to try by the end of next year mellor says action is vital because the pay gap in the uk is the worst in europe in the netherlands the average hourly wage of a parttime woman worker is per cent less than that of a fulltime male in the uk it is per cent less few would deny that direct discrimination is only part of the story and that womens disproportionate share of family responsibilities as well as poor provision of childcare in the uk and continued stereotyping in career choices all play a significant part in the disparity between male and female incomes one of the main reasons women are still paid less than men is that the jobs which many women do are less well paid more than per cent of women workers are in just occupations where they are greatly overrepresented per cent work as sales assistants per cent as teachers per cent as secretaries and per cent as nurses none of them highly paid occupations by contrast more than per cent of engineers a much more highly paid profession are men by and large it is accepted that this is mainly the result of gender stereotyping which goes right back to the choices made at school but the eoc points out that some jobs such as teachers and bank tellers have seen pay fall in relative terms as they have become increasingly dominated by women in the private sector pay is left to market forces the argument being that people will only pay hairdressers what they think it is worth to have their hair done and that individual pay will vary according to the numbers of those willing to do the job in the public sector though pay levels are set by government and bear little relation to market forces in its most recent evidence to the pay review body before the latest public sector pay rises the royal college of nursing compared the salaries of nurses and police officers an occupation still dominated by men a nurses starting salary of used to be per cent less than that of a policeman it pointed out but the difference had grown to per cent within four years rachel dufton the rcns spokeswoman points out that there is a shortage of around nurses market forces would quickly drive up pay the equal opportunities com mission is planning to launch an awareness campaign this autumn on the stereotyped career choices young people make while this may persuade more girls to aspire to highlypaid careers as engineers and it professionals it may have a more difficult job persuading boys to train as nurses and shop assistants dufton says there is a danger that if you say dont go into stereotypical occupations you end up further devaluing the caring professions such as nursing in the long term the superior academic results being achieved by girls should go a long way towards narrowing the gender gap on pay but campaigners arent prepared to wait they want action from

womens satisfaction with their careers is plummeting because they receive such little support at work and home new research suggests only of all working women in the uk said they would work full time if they had a choice according to a survey out today another study to be published tomorrow claims that just are happy with the hours they put into their jobs a decade ago the majority were satisfied as female employees begin to break through the glass ceiling many take on extra responsibility at work while still shouldering heavy responsibilities at home nearly half of all working women have children under five tellingly of women said they could enjoy working if that was all they had to do but of full time employees said they did most of the household chores and more than of working mothers said they still bore most of the burden of childcare more than half of those interviewed said their companies made no allowances for women with children only said firms offered a creche to employees the survey of working women was carried out for top sant magazine in association with bupa its findings are reinforced by a study of working hours carried out for the economic and social research council which will be presented to the annual conference of acas the conciliation service tomorrow the survey of employees found that men and women were increasingly disillusioned with their careers the results were compared with an earlier study in of male employees were very or completely satisfied with their hours but by this year that had dropped to although their female counterparts were keener they were also losing enthusiasm much more rapidly in were satisfied with their work but in the new survey only said they were satisfied the majority of staff said they worked long hours because it was expected of them rather than to earn more money time not money is for many the barrier to enjoying a richer life said michael white of the policy studies institute which produced the research with a team from the london school of economics he added employee motivation will continue to ebb away unless employers wake up to the new reality dissatisfied employees are twice as likely as their more contented colleagues to look for a new job and much less willing to put in extra effort at work a survey carried out for the department for education and employment in november last year found that most men as well as women wanted more flexible arrangements such as job sharing and a reduced working week the government is considering proposals giving working mothers the right to work reduced hours for up to a year after their childs birth children do better at school are less likely to be involved in crime and have better social skills if fathers as well as mothers are involved in

britain currently lags behind all other european countries when it comes paid maternity leave and even with proposed improved rights for pregnant women and new mothers most of which will not come into force until april the uk still will not approach the best in europe denmark where women receive weeks leave on of salary equivalent to weeks on full pay currently ranks top in europe according to the latest available data in contrast the majority of working women in britain qualify for a package which is equivalent to just weeks leave on full pay according to united nations statistics british maternity rights are even more miserly than those in dozens of african asian and latin american countries including for example angola congo brazil peru afghanistan india and bangladesh surprising consolation perhaps is the fact that pregnant women and new mothers fare even worse in the us and australia where there is no legal right at all to paid maternity leave in the us working mothers or fathers employed by companies with or more workers are entitled to take a total of only weeks unpaid leave for the birth of a child internet chatrooms on us parenting websites are rife with the woes

in tony blair was swept into office by a country of hopeful women two million more votes were cast by women almost all of them for labour returning a record women to the commons the iconic photograph of blair surrounded by his women mps reflected a genuine expectation that we were about to discover a whole new way of conducting parliamentary democracy this morning the picture could not be more different after an election campaign defined by the utter invisibility of women an analysis of the abominably low turnout is very likely to show a substantial number of women abstaining and while so far this morning there is actually a net gain of one woman in the house we already know that numbers do not equal visibility when did labour lose sight of gender was it lulled into complacency by the sea of women that set apart the intake or convinced by the wave of female support that swung the election for it both have proved themselves to be costly chimeras that wary and conditional support is dissipating with midterm polls finding more women than men turning against the government it is ironic that although no other government has given women more on paper the minimum wage the childcare strategy a rise in maternity pay women have continued to declare themselves less satisfied while young women are least likely to vote meanwhile the concerns voiced by harriet harman and joan ruddock last conference that no more women would be selected without positive action have been borne out tenfold fewer than one in five candidates selected by the five main parties were women with labour fielding a total of female candidates out of seats bolstering the notion that male mps remain the norm the labour party has privately blamed the poor calibre of women coming forward for the dismal selection results but is it any wonder that women are reluctant to enter politics the commons is institutionally hostile to women not only because of its preference for confrontation over consensus but also thanks to the ridiculous hours that preclude any semblance of balanced life note the word balance rather than the devalued phrase familyfriendly which feeds the assumption that women are a tetchy addon to the democratic process placated with a couple more loos and the possibility of breastfeeding on the front benches reform is vital nor is it the commons alone that has proved hostile a recent study for the campaigning group women in journalism found that most of the women mps who won their seats in the last election believed that the way they had been portrayed in the media undermined their performance would deter other women from standing for parliament and would make local parties less likely to select women but perhaps its not surprising they were portrayed as pleasers shrinking violets or automatons given that they were always going to consider confrontation unproductive the higher proportion of women in government has made a genuine difference though it hasnt been an immediately apparent one they have exerted power behind the scenes lobbying arguing bending ears particularly that of the chancellor gordon brown originally never meant to include lone parents in the new deal but determined women like harriet harman brought real understanding of what poverty means to women and that childcare is at the very core of hoisting women and children out of poverty but the flipside of this is the fact that the government itself has failed to trumpet what it has done for women only of parents know that the national childcare strategy exists for example after the millions spent on the childcare programme it was barely mentioned in this campaign what women voters want most of all is a point of entry into a system that continues to alienate them inside and underestimates them outside poll after poll shows that the public hates the look of parliament the bluster and the bombast as the low turnout suggests people are weary of the inner machinations of the citadel female support for labour was initially shallow because women are naturally riskaverse which is not the same as naturally conservative it was ripe for consolidation this morning labour may

the confidence of school leavers from the girl power generation is about to be shattered by glaring inequalities in the jobs market the equal opportunities commission warned yesterday in its annual report julie mellor the chairwoman contrasted young womens high performance at school and university with their experience of continuing discrimination in employment despite all their achievements young women still enter a far narrower range of jobs than young men they are already earning less than their male colleagues by the age of and they are less likely ever to reach the top of their field of work she said britain still has to address the glaring inequalities that so many women and men face otherwise we risk disappointing the high hopes of the girl power generation some of whom will be entering the job market before very long the commission received complaints about possible cases of discrimination in the year to the end of march they included calls about pregnancy and maternity issues on working hours on equal pay for like work and on sexual harassment compensation awards included for a financial accountant in devon who missed promotion while on maternity leave and for a truck driver from grangemouth who was made redundant after complaining about the sexist behaviour of her male colleagues ms mellor said sex equality was no longer just a womens issue in the workplace men as well as women need more choice about how they balance work with their lives outside work so that they are able to fulfil their role as fathers she said those who were not parents were also entitled to flexible working arrangements for example to provide time to take a course or be active in the community the commission will be campaigning for legislation to make employers carry out pay reviews to discover if there is a bias against women its other objectives include a right for employees to be taken seriously by their employers if they ask for more flexible working hours lady morgan the minister for women said the government was committed to helping young women fulfil their potential in the workplace the report identifies that stereotyping is damaging to both men and women and that flexible hours are important to all parents not just mums she said the government yesterday promised tougher action to stamp out racial harassment in the nhs john hutton the health minister published guidance to make managers take the problem more seriously and provide better support for ethnic minority staff the move followed disclosure in the guardian last month of a confidential government report showing that at least half the nhs frontline staff from ethnic minorities were victims of pervasive racial harassment last year the kings fund an independent health think tank that has led a campaign against racism in the nhs said the guidelines were a sign of good leadership julia neuberger the funds chief executive said in both medicine and nursing racial discrimination is a major cause of the nhs staffing crisis by sending out such clear signals that racist behaviour is not to be tolerated and by following that up with concerted action the government is not just helping those at the receiving end of racist abuse but benefiting everyone who works in or uses the nhs,2001-07,confidence school leaver girl power generation shattered glaring inequality job market equal

the pay gap between male and female academics is widening with some uk universities paying women around three quarters of the average salaries of men research published today shows women academics last year earned less than men compared with five years ago only four higher education institutions paid women more using figures from the higher education statistics agency the association of university teachers names and shames institutions with poor records on equal pay the worst offenders are st georges hospital medical school in south london the london business school and wye college all of which pay women less than of male salaries the universities of leicester aston aberdeen glasgow and st andrews are all around the mark university college london the london school of economics kings college imperial college and the universities of edinburgh newcastle cardiff manchester birmingham nottingham reading and bristol have a pay gap of or more david triesman general secretary of the association of university teachers which produced the report said it exposes the shocking truth about pay inequality in higher education while university vicechancellors have awarded themselves record salary increases they have presided over a growing pay gap he said despite continued assurances from universities about the important role of equality on campus we have seen yet again an increase in pay discrimination there is now a clear and urgent case for government and universities to work together to end this disgraceful practice maryann stephenson director of the womens pressure group the fawcett society said the figures provide a really strong case for improvements in equal pay legislation if the government is hoping to persuade employers to take action to close the private sector pay gap it needs to set an example by closing the gap in the public sector the government has launched an awards scheme for the private sector to encourage equal pay the academic pay gap has widened in england and northern ireland but reduced in scotland and wales but in scotland and wales differences are still wider than the uk average with male academics earning more than women a spokeswoman for st georges medical school which pays women academics of male salaries on average said the reason it sounds so bad is the majority of senior staff are male and the female staff are at more junior levels and still working their way through the majority of senior staff are still male if you think about particularly the clinical staff female clinicians stop to have children and go parttime so they dont progress to the senior levels as fast a spokeswoman from the london business school said lbs does not discriminate on pay on the basis of gender and the figures the report shows are not representative of senior members of faculty here because we dont actually have any female professors here we have assistant professors and a couple of associate professors but that is something we are actively seeking to address we are looking to recruit women on to the faculty we pay a very competitive salary to both men and women we do not discriminate between the two a spokesman for glasgow university said we wish to study the figures before commenting in detail however a league table comparing all universities is not comparing like with like it is possible that the unique renumeration systems of the medical profession may have affected the position of universities such as glasgow and others with large medical schools a spokesman for the university of leicester said that men and women are paid the same if they do the same job and differences only arise with changes in responsibility promotion length of time in post distinctions and productivity the surrey

so many burnt bras such little progress three decades after women first made pyres from their underwear in the name of equality they may have felt they were at last edging ahead in the battle of the sexes in fact they may already have lost the war the biggest ever study of male behaviour reveals the notsoshocking reality behind the progressive veneer of st century britain equality remains as illusory a goal as it was years ago despite the best efforts of a generation of feminist campaigners british men still enjoy the best of most worlds according to the study published today by the office for national statistics their incomes remain double that of the female half of the population even though equal pay legislation is held up as one of modern feminisms greatest triumphs and when they leave work men spend more time eating out gardening and watching television but in return do less than a quarter of the cooking and routine housework the study recognises that time has not entirely stood still men are less likely to be the sole breadwinner and are more likely to be cohabiting separated or divorced in many ways men today live in a different world from that of their fathers the report points out but in practical terms the differences are not that obvious according to the study the average gross income for british men was a week compared with for women womens average gross incomes peak in their mids at about a week before falling away during the main childrearing years and dropping below a week in their late s the comparable figures for men show a steady climb towards a sustained income plateau averaging about a week from to before gently declining towards the end of their working lives but never far enough to fall below women women may now be leaving school with better academic qualifications than men and taking more than half the places on university undergraduate courses but their achievement is still being undermined by the impact of family and

an obligation on companies to reveal whether they treat women fairly is being drawn up by denise kingsmill the lawyer commissioned by the government to conduct a review of women at work modelled on codes for corporate governance executive pay and environmental responsibility to which all stock market listed firms are expected to comply companies will report to their shareholders each year on human capital management a statistical analysis of their approach to employment and promotion opportunities mrs kingsmill a lawyer who is deputy chairwoman of the competition commission believes firms should voluntarily conduct an annual survey of staff pay so comparisons can be made year on year between men and women in similar jobs her report will contain a guide to employers on best practice and also one for employees detailing what sort of treatment workers should expect she is shortly to ask the accounting standards board which sets out the accounting framework to which companies must adhere to consider beginning the work to require firms to include a section on human capital in reports her aim is to set out the practicalities in implementing the proposal made in a detailed report which she is due to deliver to patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary and minister for women after the summer the report is likely to cause controversy the confederation of british industry opposes pay surveys or audits as increasing the administrative burden on firms the government is also facing criticism for appearing to back down on issues concerning women in the workplace and failing to resolve an gap in average hourly earnings between men and women mrs kingsmill was commissioned in april to conduct an independent review of equality and fairness at work she will also draw up measures for the public sector the proposals aimed at companies will not endorse positive discrimination they are intended to be advantageous to all employees the human capital management report which might be one page in an annual report would also allow men to see how they fared relative to their peers but mrs kingsmill admitted it would include a significant gender element the successful

men pay lip service to equal rights in the home while letting women do threequarters of the household chores new research suggests however women who are career high flyers do substantially less than women in lower paid work the study shows every increase in a womans annual income reduces the time she spends on chores every week by nearly two hours an oxford university researcher manyee kan discovered that women still did the bulk of the housework on average more than hours a week compared with about six hours for the average man the survey of couples did not count childcare as housework but looked at the division of labour in unpaid household work such as cooking cleaning and grocery shopping ms kan found that men were not much more inclined to pitch in around the home if their partners worked long hours the factors which did make a difference were the womans earning power how educated she was and how young this was because a higher income gave a woman more bargaining power in the family according to ms kan being able to buy more household goods did not make a difference she said most of the studies since the introduction of new technology have found that machines dont help to reduce workload if you raise efficiency you raise peoples expectations if you have a washing machine you wash more often rather than once a week however educated women tended to do less housework than women who had left school at the study showed working women with degrees spent about two hours less on chores than working women in households where both partners had only olevels or cses ms kan suggested this was because bettereducated women had a more egalitarian approach to how much of the housework their men ought to do the same applied to younger couples ms kan who presents her study at a conference at the institute for social and economic research university of essex today said men are taking a much more egalitarian attitude but it seems that women are still doing the lions share of the housework the attitude has changed but now we need to say to men if you think this way then go and do it ms kan said previous studies had showed that women tended to do the routine jobs around the house such as ironing while men opted for the nonroutine work the writer fay weldon in whose household the division of labour includes her husband taking out the rubbish while she cleans up the cat sick said that such studies missed the fact that housework could be fun more women like doing housework than men its a nesting instinct some women dont and dont do any but more men dont care what the house looks like women who are better off just employ other women to do the housework the rich have to find the energy to earn more money the idea is that housework is a terrible burden but it is just something you do to make your house look nice,2001-07,men pay lip service equal right home letting woman threequarters household chore new research suggests however woman career

the debate about whether or not to smack children took a new twist last night when a governmentbacked body insisted that violence achieves nothing and parents should be taught how to restrain themselves in order to reduce the risk of abuse reigniting controversy on whether recommendations about family life amount to a nanny state the findings will also disappoint campaigners who believe the government is shying away from outlawing smacking the report from the national family and parenting institute nfpi argues that smacking does not work and calls for a public education campaign on alternative methods of discipline but valerie riches founder of pressure group family and youth concern said this sounds like the nanny state raising its head again we would protest any attempt to remove from parents the right to make decisions about what goes on inside the family home many children are undisciplined and appropriate discipline is needed ministers have so far rejected demands for smacking to be banned however the nfpi argues that physical punishment does not appear to work in sufficient measure to compensate for the full range of its negative complications including the danger that it may lead to physically abusive behaviour but mainly the risk that parents might rely on it to the exclusion of developing and using other more efficient techniques american child development expert diana baumrind last week dismissed suggestions that spanking harms children when parents are loving and firm and communicate well with the child she said the children are exceptionally competent and welladjusted whether or not their parents spanked them as preschoolers one survey of british parents found that per cent thought it was sometimes necessary to smack a naughty child a department of health study found per cent had smacked with less than half regretting it the law permits reasonable chastisement ten european countries have banned physical punishment of children the nfpi report concedes that while parents who hit their children are statistically more likely to tip over into abuse there is no evidence that normal mild smacking if used sparingly and rationally by parents who are loving damages a childs development however only one parent in five thought it achieved anything with many admitting it had more to do with relieving their own frustration than changing the childs behaviour parents often lashed out harshly without rational argument when at the end of their tether the report argues it stops short of calling for a ban on smacking but says a statesponsored campaign could teach other positive parenting skills such as explaining and reasoning with older children and rewarding good behaviour,2001-08,debate whether smack

working women have largely won the battle for equality with men on pay but should get help to crack the socalled glass ceiling at work according to the governments equal pay tsar denise kingsmill is set to recommend measures such as letting working parents reduce their hours mentoring for female graduates and actively grooming women for the boardroom in order to help them break through firms could choose which approach to use but would be forced to publish their strategy in annual reports she also favours private firms bidding for government business being forced to check pay levels and tackle any injustice before they could win contracts kingsmills words will anger some campaigners who regard the struggle for a fair wage as far from over with women still earning pence for every pound a man takes home but her early findings suggest the key to the pay gap is not so much women earning less than a man for the same job but female workers being denied the most senior most lucrative posts we have won the battle for equality largely not wholly but nobody is saying we are going to pay women less than men for the same job she said the way i am looking at it is now squarely and fairly about the productivity and competitiveness of british industry if you are not using highly talented expensive highly skilled resources it is a waste kingsmill a highflying excity lawyer appointed to the review by ministers earlier this summer said her research repeatedly found women clustered at middling ranks unable to reach the higherpaid top jobs one big accountancy firm found it lost most staff around the age of but while the men left having made the rank of partner to take a better job the women departed because they had despaired of ever making partner she said companies believed they did not have women in the highest posts because women leave to have babies but they dont and the companies dont know that its not something they have measured there are a lot of assumptions made that women are less aggressive or that they dont want more responsibilities and they are wrong women had to prove themselves repeatedly to get promoted while men got the benefit of the doubt she said ministers have already ruled out forcing all employ ers to conduct pay audits as the equal opportunities commission eoc and unions want but kingsmill who aims to halve the pay gap by believes firms bidding for government contracts should be obliged to genderproof pay scales in the us if you want a federal contract you have got to have done this and have done for many years she said meanwhile the soaring number of tribunal cases over pay could be cut by filtering cases through independent arbitrators designed to give an initial ruling on whether the woman has a case last night the eoc challenged the view that women had won the battle responsible employers may not believe that they discriminate against their female staff but until they carry out a pay review they cant

an ambitious target to halve the gender pay gap in the next five years was unveiled yesterday by denise kingsmill the lawyer commissioned by the government to find ways of eradicating workplace inequality mrs kingsmill said that men are still paid more than women despite the equal pay act at that time the gulf was she said id like to see it down in single figures in five years mrs kingsmill who is also deputy chairman of the competition commission has been set an autumn deadline to complete a review and come up with proposals to narrow the gap among her proposals is a recommendation that companies be forced to outline their approach to human capital management in their annual reports this will be a statistical analysis of their treatment of both men and women the radical suggestion which could result in a best practice code is likely to be taken up by the accounting standards board which confirmed yesterday that it is aiming to publish a consultation document early next year mrs kingsmill said she would step back from endors ing a mandatory annual survey of pay structures as favoured by the equal opportunities commission her approach is expected to endorsed by government which is anxious to avoid conflict with business leaders she said her aim was to capture the hearts and minds of top executives and avoid confrontation she believes that pressure from major city investors will force companies to comply with the proposed codes some of the companies with us experience have al ready learnt the lesson she said however while mrs kingsmill said she felt she was pushing at an open door after her discussions with the chief executives of of the companies in the ftse share index other experts on equal pay were less convinced a spokeswoman for the equal opportunities commission said a lot of companies know there is a problem but do not believe that it exists in their organisation her final proposals will also include a guide which might include recognition of different career paths and the socalled worklife balance as well as meeting criteria about fair remuneration packages companies largely recruit staff in equal numbers but are not developing them at the same rate she cited statistics showing that women start out on an equal footing at ages but by the age of earn two thirds of their male counterparts after the age of the gap

theyve done it to the railways some hospitals a few schools and have plans to expand it to air traffic control and the tube but the latest thing our government is eager to privatise is far more personal parenthood as the history books will tell you raising children was once considered a communal activity how the next generation turned out wasnt down to one or two grown ups but to all of us their future was our future whether or not we shared the same hut but this governments new measures make raising children a matter of private not public concern yesterday new powers were introduced allowing police to request blanket curfews in specified areas that require all children up to to be back home in time for the nine oclock watershed it is banishing children from our public spaces the introduction of these extended curfew orders previously only covering children to age comes with a mishmash of messages even the minister responsible isnt sure whom theyre designed to benefit groups of young people involved in antisocial behaviour can cause fear and distress in local communities beverley hughes announced so the curfew is to protect innocent and vulnerable adults from predatory preteens is it no she added by extending child curfew orders to include children up to the age of police and local authorities are also better able to protect them from the risks of being unaccompanied on the streets at night from adults such as drug dealers or pimps oh so its to protect innocent preteens from the devils among us what is clear is that curfews are just another measure in the increasing privatisation of parenthood raising janet and john is now up to mum and occasionally dad sid and beryl up the road should have nothing to do with it jack straws introduction of parental orders last year the case last week when amanda and gareth edwards were found guilty of manslaughter of her daughter and friend who died playing on railway tracks and the obsession with so called stranger danger all bolster the assumption that children are the sole responsibility of those who raise them minister for children and the quiet august news season beverley hughes was certain of one thing shes dumping difficult kids back where they came from yesterday she told the today programme that curfew orders would help the local community to feel empowered to look after their own children in other words its their problem not ours if you live in a tworoomed flat with four teenagers then dont dare suggest they go out they might start to bother someone else rather than drive you barmy better keep them cooped up at home doing all those things the very same advisers complain they do far too much of watch tv play video games slouch and sulk a quarter of all violence is domestic almost of accidents requiring hospital treatment occur indoors and the vast majority of sexual abuse takes place within the family there really is no place like home and lets not suggest that these new measures have anything to do with the cword class thats so old labour lets use our clever code for the bottom rung of the social ladder local community community has become a classridden term the middle classes and beyond never have a local community they simply have neighbourhoods with decent houses good schools fine leisure facilities and ill place a very large bet on it no curfews so perhaps instead of advising parents to keep their children at home outdoors could become a place that young people can enjoy a few more leisure centres perhaps or a cinema or two both my local pool and cinema have closed within the last two years so even in central london a young person has to travel several miles for a swim or to see shrek the truth is these local communities on which ministers want to impose curfews are made up of families desperate to have somewhere to send their kids a curfew is no answer for any disruptiveness in the alleyways and staircases of their estate make the very same kids stay at home and theyll be bouncing off their own four walls instead what would benefit such places is somewhere outside the home for these children to go parenthood the wellbeing of the next generation is not a private affair dont lock up your daughters or sons parks pools playgrounds and public places are where they should be even at eight oclock at night schools out minister education minister stephen timms was supremely confident the indications im seeing are that we should have i think the teachers we need by september but there is a good deal of work to be done between now and then now minister what work and how surely he knows that just like parliament the schools have broken up for the summer and its simply not possible to appoint teachers when no one is there to appoint them the governors the headteachers and all the staff are away until the new term who is going to interview and assess how is the wouldbe teacher going to visit his or her prospective school when it is shut up and empty and if timms can find teachers over august when schools have failed during june and july then he must know of a source he has kept quiet about please divulge mr timms my daughters school could do with some ill have the pinot noir do you suffer from social anxiety does walking into a room full of strangers make you want to reach for the pinot noir dont panic the international handbook of social anxiety is to be published next month at last someone is taking your condition seriously biological and environmental contributions are examined cognitive behavioural

his crime if you could call it that was to be two andahalf years old and unable to wait his turn in the queue for the slide so his mother lifted him by the straps of his short dungarees and stung her hand hard across the back of his legs three times slap slap slap he howled small fists clutching at reddening skin and the rest of us in the play area winced from next year we could have called the police we wouldnt of course and the mother with the tired angry eyes would not be cuffed and carted off because despite dire warnings from the neverdidmeanyharm brigade scotlands proposed ban on smacking young children is not the end of family life as we know it in fact it is a halfhearted and deeply confused attempt to address an emotive issue under the scottish proposals it will be illegal to punish physically children under the age of three or to hit children under the age of on the head to shake them or to strike them with an implement such as a slipper it will also be illegal for childminders and childcare centres to administer corporal punishment the issue has haunted scotland since when a yearold teacher was prosecuted for smacking his eightyearold daughter after pulling down her trousers and pants when she became hysterical at the dentists horrified staff called social services after witnessing the incident but the ensuing court case split the country the girl wasnt injured but the father had lost control no one had any answers scottish ministers puffed with pride say the measures are the mark of a decent society protecting children from harsh degrading and inappropriate treatment only thats not what theyre proposing come your third birthday from the neck down all bets are off it seems bizarre says kate harper of save the children to have a child protected fully until their third birthday and then the day after they can be subject to punishment we need to have a full withdrawal of physical punishment of children it is a fundamental human right to protection from harm and this does not go far enough it has gone far enough however to rouse countless parents and family campaigners they say that any form of ban would be unenforceable would criminalise caring mums and dads and would act as a snoops charter they say the state has no place interfering in family life that it is a parents right to discipline their child to do with their offspring as they see fit this is dark territory parental responsibilities and discipline is a responsibility not a right do not overrule human rights and parents do not possess children to mould to their will enforcement issues while undoubtedly complex can be ironed out what matters most is the statement of intent but it is easier to cry big brother than to admit that smacking says more about our own levels of discipline than our childrens children frustrate it is what they do and nothing can cause such nerveshredding frustration as a child wilful irrational and possessed of limited comprehension who among us hasnt felt the twitch in the fingers when all the reasoning and shouting has come to nought so many parents succumb whether it is a rap over the knuckles a clip round the ear or a fullon lunatic do not hit your sister spanking each word syncopated with a hefty thwack on the backside one recent survey found that of parents had resorted to smacking and less than half had regretted it but only thought it achieved anything and most admitted it had more to do with relieving their own frustration than changing the childs behaviour another governmentcommissioned study by the national family and parenting institute concluded that physical punishment does not appear to work in sufficient measure to compensate for the full range of its negative complications including the danger that it may lead to physically abusive behaviour but mainly the risk that parents might rely on it to the exclusion of developing and using other more efficient techniques westminster has yet to make up its mind what to do despite a ukwide consultation and the ruling by the european court of human rights that english law did not offer sufficient protection to children ten european states including germany have outlawed physical punishment of children without the collapse of family life but tony blair has admitted to smacking his kids and childminders south of the border have been given the goahead to smack with parents permission much has been made of scotland taking the lead on the issue but the bar has been set too low and privately childrens campaigners say the scottish proposals will only blunt the growing pressure for comprehensive change across the uk and may let westminster off the hook it is doubtful that even a total ban would have sent any of us in the playground scurrying to dial when that mum lost control what it might have done though is make her pause before her own shortcomings were stamped so publicly on her childs skin,2001-09,crime could

first let me make it very clear i hate violence against children i have never smacked my own children and never would when i have witnessed other parents smacking their children i have been horrified it never seemed appropriate and it always struck me as an example of a parent with a lousy temper out of control but nor do i like parents shouting at their children or even the way parents can cajole and manipulate them to suit their own ends oooh sweetie you dont want to come with mummy you stay here with the babysitter sounds innocuous of course but you are basically telling your child that they dont know what they want do that often enough and the child will cease really knowing what he or she wants the point is that there is a whole range of parental behaviour towards children which is detrimental to their wellbeing and about which the state cannot do anything there is a fine line to tread here between the states duty to protect the rights of the child and its duty to respect the familys right to privacy and the scottish executives proposal to ban smacking children under three has bulldozed through that line to pass a law against smacking toddlers is a ludicrous intervention into one of the most intimate and private of relationships laws already exist to protect children from serious abuse the courts can judge already what constitutes unreasonable force the new proposals are about criminalising even the smack on the leg to which most parents admit they sometimes in sheer frustration resort parenting is a task quite unlike any other form of childcare in its intensity and relentlessness teachers and nursery assistants are rightly banned from using corporal punishment but parents are a different case even the best of good parents sometimes snap should that be made a crime all parents know that they sometimes fail and that can haunt the anxious does the exhausted mother dealing with a toddler tantrum at the checkout as well perhaps as a wailing baby now have to worry whether the checkout girl will report her to the police if she smacks her child by all means campaign against parents resorting to a smack run parenting classes and so on but the law is simply too crude a weapon to use in such circumstances persuasion not coercion is the way to achieve this cultural change besides the law is simply unenforceable who can see into the privacy of the family home as even the campaigners in support of the measure seem to accept when they talk about using the law to send clear messages but that is not what the law is there for you use modern communications to send clear messages and you use the law to enforce and to punish crimes the mother or father who slaps needs help they do not need to be turned into criminals political rift over scottish bid to

scotland is expected to make smacking young children illegal for the first time in the uk rousing the ire of family campaigners and widening the growing political chasm between holyrood and westminster under proposals unveiled yesterday smacking children under the age of three will be illegal as will be hitting any child on the head shaking them or striking them with an implement it will also be illegal for childcare centres nonpublicly funded preschool centres and childminders to administer corporal punishment the scottish justice minister jim wallace said parents would still have the right to chastise their offspring but there would be more restrictions on them and courts will help decide what constitutes reasonable punishment the proposals which form part of the new criminal justice bill and will be set out in a white paper in october are the latest policy split between the scottish executive and westminster the decision to ban smacking follows the abolition of tuition fees and section and the promise of free care for the elderly north of the border childrens charities said that the plans do not go far enough but added that youngsters in other parts of the uk must be offered similar protection the scottish proposals follow a ukwide consultation on the issue but westminster has yet to act any legislation south of the border is expected to fall short of even a limited ban on smacking opposition parties in scotland gave a mixed response to the measures the scottish national party said it would support the move but the conservatives said it was misconceived and unnecessary mr wallace said the proposals reflected the public mood he added we want to amend the law to protect children from punishment that is harsh degrading and completely inappropriate in a decent society and i know this is something the majority of people in scotland will support the primary consideration in decisions about children is the welfare of the child while we believe that parents should have the rights to set the grounds for the discipline of their children we felt there was a strong need for greater clarification of the law as to what is defined reasonable punishment mr wallace said it had been deemed necessary to include a total ban on physical punishment of children under three up to this age it is very doubtful that a child would understand why he or she was being punished and if the child was in any imminent danger it should be possible for an adult to restrain or remove the child from danger rather than punish them he said the snp education spokesman mike russell said both european law and united nations conventions are rightly strong in seeking to prevent any abuse of children and the measures announced today by jim wallace if sadly necessary will have the support of the snp but the scottish conservatives dismissed the proposals as unnecessary the tory justice spokesman lord james douglas hamilton said jim wallace should resist his apparently insatiable desire to legislate and instead choose to trust the good sense of the courts which are best placed to determine what is reasonable and what is unreasonable when it comes to the disciplining of children kate harper of save the children said the plans were a move in the right direction but stopped well short of what was required it is confusing and it does not go far enough it is going to be very difficult for parents to be clear about what levels of violence they can use she added it seems bizarre to have a child protected fully until their third birthday and then the day after that they can be subject to punishment we need to have a full withdrawal of physical punishment and corporal punish ment of children it is a fundamental human right to protection from harm the nspcc policy director phillip noyes however said the proposals were welcome and the rest of the uk should now follow suit an adult hitting a child of any age is not right and there are much better ways to discipline children the scottish proposals move us one step closer to the goal of full legal protection for all children in all parts of the uk he said,2001-09,scotland expected make smacking

as the summer holidays end the nights draw in and schools reopen adults all over the country may well be heaving a sigh of relief that there will be fewer children hanging about on the streets or the local shopping centre or playing in the park the way we all use public space is one of the most contentious areas of daily life and is often at the heart of disputes between young people and adults the importance of public space to childrens development and young peoples lives is poorly understood by adults whilst young people may be oblivious to adult concerns yet instead of developing mechanisms for consultation and negotiation which involve young people and help them play a part in decision making the response of adults is generally to override young peoples wishes more often than not with the backing of the public authorities through its national strategy for neighbourhood renewal nsnr the government places considerable importance on active citizenship and community partnerships that involve young people there is equal emphasis on controlling antisocial behaviour and getting communities to work together however the spinoffs from these new arrangements are not always positive and in some cases may even have unfortunate consequences for the communities they are designed to help the recently introduced curfew legislation is a case in point from august this year local authorities and the police were given powers to apply for curfew orders forcing young people up to the age of off the streets between the hours of pm and am although curfew legislation has been introduced with good intent there are fears that its practice may inhibit rather than enhance community regeneration and provoke rather than discourage youth disaffection notwithstanding the fact that the legislation breaches childrens human rights imposing curfews challenges the notion of young people as responsible citizens and potentially taints the majority because of the actions of the few it also risks discriminating against the least affluent evidence shows that children from more wealthy families are most likely to be escorted between commercialised leisure opportunities or to be at home in any case the areabased approach to curfews may even exacerbate inequalities between neighbourhoods there is a fear that the local authorities most likely to impose a curfew are those whose communities are already close to the edge of society where poor quality environments offer little for young people to do in the first place the imposition of a curfew would add to the bleakness of these places and further contribute to a society of haves and have nots there is also a very real possibility of a displacement effect as particular neighbourhoods adopt the curfew and herd young people towards other generally better off areas where they are viewed with even greater suspicion and hostility one of the main arguments against curfews is that they reinforce a view that the public domain is adult territory to which young people have only limited entitlement and then only with the sanction of their elders and betters throughout the curfew debate there has been no attempt to incorporate the views of young people about how they see the places where they live and play this is at the heart of the problem as much neighbourhood conflict arises from a poor understanding among adults of how children use and relate to public space children have a very strong sense of place and public spaces are vital for developing social networks and selfconfidence they are areas where young people learn about the world and have fun and crucially where they can exercise freedom and exert control it is interesting to note that young people adapt their environment to meet their needs green spaces become football pitches and multistorey car parks turn into skateboard parks allowing young people to take responsibility for their own public spaces rather than keeping them at home can produce huge benefits for both the young participants and the community in general young voices in regeneration is a national partnership programme developed by groundwork and save the children which aims to find practical ways of enabling all young people to play an active part in improving the physical environment of their neighbourhoods the programme has demonstrated the extent of poor communications between adults and children and the need for intermediary agencies to broker negotiation by working with adults and young people alike often what young people want is very simple a place to gather and meet friends what adults want is usually just as simple to know that their children are safe and are able to grow and develop without drifting into antisocial behaviour children as citizens have a fundamental right and entitlement to be involved in shaping their own communities only through regular participation will children develop a sense of communal responsibility and the skills needed to make a positive impact on their neighbourhoods much is happening and the government has made huge strides with the development of the nsnr however there is still a long way to go before childrens participation becomes normal and routine of course this isnt just a job for politicians it depends on us all much more needs to be done to widen the debate about childrens participation within the uk so that it becomes a compelling issue not just for professionals but for all adults and communities professor hugh matthews is director of the centre for children and youth

group solidarity and mutual trust are the key factors behind the growing success of quaker social actions qsa microcredit project street cred which helps unemployed women in east london to develop their own enterprises women working on the project join borrowing circles groups of five women who come together and support each other as they establish their respective businesses startup loans are issued on condition of the groups approval and access to future loans depends on each member of the group making repayments as agreed with street cred staff the circle is the real driver behind the project said claire caffrey street cred coordinator its a fantastic substitute for all the credits and checks required by high street banks the borrowing circle brings the women together and generates real trust and support she added the concept of the borrowing circle originates from the world famous grameen bank in bangladesh by far the most successful microcredit operation in the developing or developed world after a sponsored research trip to bangladesh qsa decided to apply this methodology to an urban setting and created street cred the active womens group based at ascot hall community centre in canning town is made up of five local women setting up businesses in dressmaking hairdressing the production and importing of african curios and in one instance buying and selling a special kind of fish stew from central africa we learn a great deal from one another and the more we learn the more we can attract other women said elli the groups voluntary coordinator perhaps then some of us can act as mentors to new women trying to get started in business we hope that the more successful we become the more we can attract other women to what we are doing she said street cred was specifically designed to help unemployed women access the business support training advice and finance necessary to establish an enterprise women have remained the focus for the project as qsa believes that business services are rarely tailored specifically towards women and take little account of factors such as childcare confidence or language barriers faced by some people from black and minority ethnic groups this may be reflected in government statistics which reveal that only one in four businesses are established by women elli whose own business is called pressing on enterprise thinks that the great deal of talk in public circles about equality and inclusion is simply not borne out in reality women are always excluded from the type of business support they need at street cred we respect one another and take each other seriously she said an ongoing problem for street creds entrepreneurs is the issue of benefits a demotivating factor for some of the women who understandably are fearful about the threat to their benefits if they start trading i think the benefits agency is living in another world said elli none of us wants to be on benefits we want to empower ourselves but its risky and takes time to establish a business the benefits agency should be working with us to remove this barrier in partnership with other organisations qsas street cred

around one in nine youngsters in the uk will run away for at least one night before they turn according to a report on youth homelessness released today the childrens society study said that poor relationships between parents and their children are the major cause of young people running away from home the report said that children in stepfamilies are three times more likely to run away or be thrown out of the family home than those living with two parents and children in single parent families are twice as likely to run away or be forced to leave the childrens societys chief executive ian sparks said the research proved that the most significant factor in running away is the quality of relationships between children and parents and called for more family mediation to help reduce tension between parents and children the study entitled home run families and young runaways was based on a survey of teenagers aged to in schools across the uk researchers also carried out interviews with young runaways an estimated unders run away from home or from care every year and of them are forced to leave by parents or carers about one in seven of those who run away end up suffering violence or sexual abuse especially those who sleep rough the research comes ahead of a government report on young runaways due to be published by the social exclusion unit young runaways in their own words the childrens journalism agency childrens express was commissioned by the social exclusion unit to interview young runaways as part of its consultation process kevin from birmingham first ran away from home when he was because of his poor relationship with his stepfather he has run away many times since and now lives in a hostel i would never have run away if it wasnt for my stepdad i used to go home when he wasnt in to see my mum he said it got to the point where i slept rough in an old bus down the road in the middle of winter with no blankets just so i didnt have to go home kevin never told his mother that he was living on the streets he describes the experience as incredibly lonely and scary and says he does not want anyone to go through what he endured before considering running away young people should speak to someone first to get to the core of the issue he advises my life would have been much better if i hadnt run away he now helps the childrens society with promotional work aimed at warning other young people about the dangers of running away john from london ran away when he experienced troubles at home a year ago he spent about a month living rough on the streets of central london i slept in a subway next to charing cross station and managed to get blankets from homeless friends id met on the streets he said during his time on the street john saw drug abuse violence and young people boys and girls forced into prostitution a homeless friend told him about the london connection a day centre for homeless young people where he presently spends the majority of his time project workers have helped him find accommodation in various hostels he has completed a computer course and applied to go to college i could never recommend running away he says he feels that the authorities do not do enough to help people in his position independence is about the only positive thing this experience has taught me but id still like to go home soon ruth from birmingham had been in care since she was and first ran away from a childrens home at the age of she says that running away was partly due to her unhappiness within the care system she found places in hostels but is unsure of their merits theyre not always a better alternative to living on the streets often girls live with the constant threat of rape i was actually threatened with a machete on one occasion it was terrifying ruth believes that many young people prefer to live on the streets because of the atmosphere in hostels she encountered many runaways who committed crimes or harmed

superwoman is a myth twentyfive years after author shirley conran made millions by telling us that life was too short to stuff a mushroom new research shows women still believe they cannot have children and a career without feeling stressed exhausted and guilty four out of five british mothers resent women such as victoria beckham and cherie blair who are feted for coping with both family and highpressure jobs and more than half of women dont believe that their partner plays a significant role in the juggling act that is daily family life for most many women can rattle off to the nearest quarter of an hour where they are going to be during the day said fiona keyte of analysts publicis who carried out the nationwide study all too often husbands dont feature mothers are also very cynical about images and advertisements which portray women as brilliant and ordered and perfect they know that life is simply not like that eightynine per cent of women identified pop star victoria beckham as a show mum a career woman who never appears late or with a sick child per cent put the duchess of york and cherie blair a highprofile qc who earns far more than her husband the prime minister in the same category women object to the idea that such figures serve as role models to working mothers i really did once think that wed be the first generation that could have it all said ann finlay a yearold solicitor in edinburgh who has a sixyearold daughter it just hasnt happened im lucky my employers are very supportive but its still a huge effort to keep everything together even after we found a good au pair and a nursery im constantly negotiating and juggling there are days when i just know i cant leave work later than and if were let down by one of our helpers i face chaos for days its a constant stress that our mothers and grandmothers didnt have because they took or years off work more than half of the mothers surveyed identified themselves as undervalued overcriticised and tired they said key concerns were lack of time and the safety of their children women interviewed in depth said they did not regret having children for one moment but felt that the best years of their lives had passed and they now had little time for themselves kathy a yearold living in sheffield with two children told researchers by the time youve read to them bathed them put them to bed done the washingup and cleaned the kitchen its time to go to bed and then you have to start all over again emma from birmingham said i wish id known what kids would do to my life i wouldnt be without them but id like to have made more of a career out of my life first shirley conran first wife of design guru terence touched a nerve with millions of women when she published superwoman a selfhelp guide in as well as avoiding complicated cookery the book advised women to avoid unnecessary housework and sweep dirt under the rug it was the first time the notion of a worklife balance between career and family received popular recognition the reality for most working women is that finding childcare and balancing work and family life is still incredibly difficult in the uk today said stephen burke director of the daycare trust there is still only one childcare place for every seven children under the age of eight and british parents pay the highest childcare bills in europe until we see much greater investment in affordable childcare women will continue to struggle on a daily basis and their children will miss out recent research confirms that britain still has lower levels of childcare provision than almost every other european country meanwhile while businesses satisfy our demand for a society with shops and services open hours a day seven days a week per cent of families have a parent who works at weekends the number is expected to double by even when men are offering to do things for them said fiona keyte most women believe that men wont think three steps ahead in the way that they do the greater burden of looking after children almost always still rests with the woman they would certainly be much happier if that reality was reflected in the way that

women like nicola horlick who hold down a demanding job and raise a family are usually described as having it all they seem to exemplify the s feminist ideal but recent research suggests that when it comes to deciding whether to return to work after starting a family most women feel they have no choice insurer norwich union found that although per cent of mothers return to work only per cent of those are keen to further their careers the overwhelming majority per cent start working again because they need the money these find ings were supported by a survey by ariel nonbio which found that six out of working mothers would prefer to ditch their careers if money were no object kate maycock spokesperson for the pressure group the mothers union believes its a simple case of women not receiving enough financial assistance it is not a question of choice but a question of economic necessity this situation may improve in the last budget labour promised more help for families last month it raised the working families tax credit where one parent is working from to a week as of april statutory paid maternity leave will be extended for employees from weeks to weeks and statutory maternity pay will rise from to a week but parent groups such as the maternity alliance claim uk parents are still worse off than those in the rest of europe government statistics also indicate that people in the uk now spend more of their income on running their households spending on leisure items such as holidays tv video and audio equipment has risen by more than per cent since the s is this why women feel pressured to return to work not according to cary cooper professor of occupational psychology at umist in manchester he says blue collar mothers work because they need the money they are on the breadline so they need two earners in the family lower middle class mothers work because they want to be able to pay for things for their children that they couldnt otherwise afford middle class and upper middle class mothers where there has been the biggest increase in working mothers dont do it for the money they feel the only work that is valued is paid work outside the house they do

wackford squeers would be proud the government believes in the reasonable chastisement of small children it said last week announcing it would not follow the scottish executive in banning smacking this qualification is quite good enough to protect toddlers from being seriously hurt says health minister jacqui smith it would be sad enough to find iain duncan smith and his eccentric reminiscers for a happier victorian era prosecuting such nonsense but for a new labour government to be doing so is truly depressing it is unlawful to hit another adult whether you think such chastisement reasonable or not it is also unlawful to subject an adult to corporal punishment why it should therefore be acceptable to hit children who have none of the strength to resist or hit back is incomprehensible it should not take cases such as those of victoria climbie or jasmine beckford to remind us of the dangers of validating adult authority to hurt children every year in britain children die from cruelty at the hands of their carers all too often they are victims of a mentality which condones the assault on children for far too many parents that offers an excuse for the first step on a route to abuse supporters of the hitting of children often claim that abuse rather than reasonable chastisement only happens in single parent or feckless households this is not true research carried out by the department of health itself in found that per cent of children in stable twoparent families had been hit with an implement and one third had been punished severely in other words such abuse is all too commonplace it is not just reputedly liberal scandinavia but countries including germany austria and cyprus which have now outlawed the hitting of children none of them shows any of the claimed disbenefits such as increased juvenile crime or school truancy alleged all too often by its supporters all the evidence is that corporal punishment is a determining factor in the development of violent behaviour itself in later life and if we believe that children learn by example in almost everything else loving honesty generosity it is unsustainable to think that violence is the one behaviour pattern they will not see fit to follow above all what was disturbing about last weeks government announcement was the sense that it is another attempt to accommodate a mystical middle england rather than to do what is right no better demonstration of labour embarrassment over this exists than the appearance of the thoroughly decent foreign office minister denis macshane on

a labour backbench revolt was brewing last night over an expected government announcement today that will tell parents in england and wales they can continue to smack their children without interference from the state alan milburn the health secretary will reject pressure from childrens charities to follow the example of scotland where the devolved administration is preparing to outlaw all physical punishment of underthrees ministers have decided that they need to make minimal changes to english law to comply with a ruling by the european court of human rights that the uk failed to protect a boy whose stepfather beat him with a cane the european judges cast doubt on the notion that british parents could commit an assault on their own children if this was done as reasonable chastisement but mr milburn is expected to declare that parents should be able to decide within reason how to punish their children without the nanny state interfering in their family life although he may tighten the law to ban punishment with canes and belts he is expected to leave the courts to determine the boundaries of reasonable chastisement david hinchliffe labour chairman of the commons health committee said the government faced a revolt on the issue there is a lot of unease among a significant number of labour mps about lack of progress on this question we cant have an effective child protection system while we preserve this archaic concept of reasonable chastisement the tragic death of victoria climbi started with slaps and smacks which escalated into terrible abuse mr hinchliffe a social worker for nearly years before becoming an mp said he had experience of being challenged in court by lawyers arguing that the marks of abuse on a childs body were the result of appropriate parental discipline we cant hope to prevent violence against children when our law and our society continue to send the wrong messages to parents he said the scottish executive decided in september to ban the smacking of children under three hitting any child over the head shaking them or striking them with an implement it also plans to make it illegal for childcare centres and childminders to administer corporal punishment this followed a ukwide consultation on the issue after the european court ruling in deciding not to follow scotlands lead mr milburn is understood to have been influenced by a survey commissioned by the government which showed that of parents thought they should decide how they disciplined their children this ran counter to a mori poll in showing that of the british public would support children having equal legal protection against assault if they could be sure that parents would not be prosecuted for trivial smacks tony blair admitted in that he had smacked his children occasionally when they were really naughty or did something nasty to another child but he said he always regretted it because there were lots of ways of disciplining a child and i dont think belting is the best way the childrens charity the nspcc said last night we are deeply concerned that the government may come out with proposals that leave children less protected south of the scottish border anything less than the scottish proposals would signal to parents in england that it is ok to hit babies and toddlers which is an extremely dangerous message young children could be hurt more easily than most people think it said it is never acceptable to cross the line and hit babies and toddlers we find it incredible that a government so committed to child protection would deliver such a cruel blow to efforts to keep babies and toddlers from harm we hope they will think again an alliance of more than organisations backing legal reform against smacking was mobilising last night to challenge the governments decision children are unbeatable was preparing to present evidence that infants under months are four times more likely to be homicide victims than the rest of the population at least one being killed every fortnight threequarters of parents smack their babies in the first year of life mostly as a result of irritation or anger the

the childrens charity nspcc last night claimed that the governments refusal to ban smacking will contribute to further suffering of children at the hands of abusive parents it released results of a survey of frontline child protection workers showing had direct personal experience of cases of abuse or neglect involving unacceptable levels of physical punishment twothirds thought a law to protect children from being hit would strengthen the ability of social workers to intervene earlier to protect a child at risk of abuse and said the current law permitting reasonable chastisement sent the wrong message to potentially abusive parents mary marsh the charitys director appealed to ministers to think again about their negative response to a ruling by the european court of human rights that the law in england failed to give children adequate protection this survey of social work professionals shows there is a link between physical punishment and abusive behaviour i am confident the majority of parents will unite with us to support changes to the law that are not an attack on them but on the significant minority of abusers who use the current law to excuse severe beatings she said the government reviewed the law on smacking after the european court ruled that the uk failed to protect a boy whose stepfather beat him with a cane the scottish executive responded with plans to ban hitting children under three and outlaw hitting any child around the head with implements but the government decided last month against changing the law in england and wales after widespread consultation alan milburn the health secretary rejected the advice of nearly all the organisations involved in child protection that smacking should be banned his decision to leave parents free to smack was supported by religious groups and the majority of individuals who responded to the consultation the nspcc survey was designed to explore the views of of its staff who were most closely involved in frontline child protection and family support their average experience in this type of work was years it found thought a law to protect children from being hit would help their work and wanted a ban on smacking babies and toddlers and on hitting any child with an implement more than half the frontline staff thought parents often tried to excuse abusive behaviour as reasonable chastisement and a further said abusive parents did this occasionally when the child protection workers were asked about cases with which they had been involved said at least half of the abuse started with light smacks that became harder and harder hits this escalation happened occasionally according to a further quarter of respondents the government claimed its m advertising campaign to attract more people to a career in social work was an overwhelming success in the first six weeks it attracted almost calls to a recruitment information line and more than visits to a

the childrens charity nspcc last night claimed that the governments refusal to ban smacking will contribute to further suffering of children at the hands of abusive parents it released results of a survey of frontline child protection workers showing had direct personal experience of cases of abuse or neglect involving unacceptable levels of physical punishment twothirds thought a law to protect children from being hit would strengthen the ability of social workers to intervene earlier to protect a child at risk of abuse and said the current law permitting reasonable chastisement sent the wrong message to potentially abusive parents mary marsh the charitys director appealed to ministers to think again about their negative response to a ruling by the european court of human rights that the law in england failed to give children adequate protection this survey of social work professionals shows there is a link between physical punishment and abusive behaviour i am confident the majority of parents will unite with us to support changes to the law that are not an attack on them but on the significant minority of abusers who use the current law to excuse severe beatings she said the government reviewed the law on smacking after the european court ruled that the uk failed to protect a boy whose stepfather beat him with a cane the scottish executive responded with plans to ban hitting children under three and outlaw hitting any child around the head with implements but the government decided last month against changing the law in england and wales after widespread consultation alan milburn the health secretary rejected the advice of nearly all the organisations involved in child protection that smacking should be banned his decision to leave parents free to smack was supported by religious groups and the majority of individuals who responded to the consultation the nspcc survey was designed to explore the views of of its staff who were most closely involved in frontline child protection and family support their average experience in this type of work was years it found thought a law to protect children from being hit would help their work and wanted a ban on smacking babies and toddlers and on hitting any child with an implement more than half the frontline staff thought parents often tried to excuse abusive behaviour as reasonable chastisement and a further said abusive parents did this occasionally when the child protection workers were asked about cases with which they had been involved said at least half of the abuse started with light smacks that became harder and harder hits this escalation happened occasionally according to a further quarter of respondents the government claimed its m advertising campaign to attract more people to a career in social work was an overwhelming success in the first six weeks it attracted almost calls to a recruitment information line and more than visits to a

become a valid trigger for removing children from their families since the court of appeal upheld the new legal position last month were seeing more and more cases like this the children act had until now offered protection for families who fell through the housing safety net it put the needs of the children above all other considerations and was used to require councils to provide accommodation for families but the recent judgment accepted that councils need only offer accommodation to children a spokeswoman for the london borough of lambeth whose legal action secured the new loophole said yesterday it was an accident that our case turned out in this way we want to help people into a home of their own but shelter is in contact with families throughout britain who expect their children to be taken into care within weeks the tv play cathy come home in which depicted social workers forcibly taking the children of a homeless family into care led to major changes in the law karen buck mp a member of the commons work and pensions select committee said the government has asked for evidence that these court judgments were impacting on real families that evidence has now clearly emerged the government must act to close this loophole before homelessness breaks up more families mary did have some good news on friday she found a house and has been told her children might be

the government is to give women new rights to find out if they earn the same as their male colleagues under a package of measures announced yesterday aimed at raising womens pay and bolstering their career prospects patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary wants big companies to disclose each year their approach to employing women as well as conducting pay reviews of the most junior and senior staff responding to a report by denise kingsmill the lawyer commissioned by the government to conduct a review of women at work ms hewitt called for a cultural change among employers an important part of this cultural change comes from providing better information to employees and to shareholders on a companys record on equal pay and employment ms hewitt said the government is determined to ensure that women do not have to face a stark choice between being a mother and a successful employee she added the ministers endorsement of the detailed analysis by mrs kingsmill follows the governments move earlier this year to give women the right to ask to work parttime when returning after having a baby the government is trying to avoid new legislation by encouraging companies to comply voluntarily and has pledged to adopt the policies in its own departments but ministers did not support all of the proposals from mrs kingsmill who spoke to the chief executives of big companies while conducting her research on why women earned less than men and were clustered in lower paid jobs the government failed to support the suggestion that companies should receive a tax credit for providing training for higher paid jobs or recruiting and training women for jobs in which they are un derrepresented nor was the government willing to set up a new academic centre of excellence to initiate research on womens careers but mrs kingsmill who is also deputy chairman of the competition commission and nonexecutive director of a number of public companies said she was delighted with the governments response to her work she would like to see the pay gap which took years to reach from halve in the next five years her aim is to persuade companies that it is in their best interests to support womens careers because not doing so was a waste of a natural resource however the governments policy of relying on voluntary compliance by companies met with a mixed response gail cartmail equalities officer for the manufacturing and science and finance union said left to their own devices employers will do nothing to bridge the pay gap compulsory pay audits are the only way forward john monks tuc general secretary called on the government to introduce legisla tion if the voluntary approach failed to work but the cbi said employers should not get all the blame the main causes are the large numbers of women working in lowpaid sectors and many women take career breaks or work parttime because of childcare responsibilities said its director of human resources

the government is to give women new rights to find out if they earn the same as their male colleagues under a package of measures announced yesterday aimed at raising womens pay and bolstering their career prospects patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary wants big companies to disclose each year their approach to employing women as well as conducting pay reviews of the most junior and senior staff responding to a report by denise kingsmill the lawyer commissioned by the government to conduct a review of women at work ms hewitt called for a cultural change among employers an important part of this cultural change comes from providing better information to employees and to shareholders on a companys record on equal pay and employment ms hewitt said the government is determined to ensure that women do not have to face a stark choice between being a mother and a successful employee she added the ministers endorsement of the detailed analysis by mrs kingsmill follows the governments move earlier this year to give women the right to ask to work parttime when returning after having a baby the government is trying to avoid new legislation by encouraging companies to comply voluntarily and has pledged to adopt the policies in its own departments but ministers did not support all of the proposals from mrs kingsmill who spoke to the chief executives of big companies while conducting her research on why women earned less than men and were clustered in lower paid jobs the government failed to support the suggestion that companies should receive a tax credit for providing training for higher paid jobs or recruiting and training women for jobs in which they are un derrepresented nor was the government willing to set up a new academic centre of excellence to initiate research on womens careers but mrs kingsmill who is also deputy chairman of the competition commission and nonexecutive director of a number of public companies said she was delighted with the governments response to her work she would like to see the pay gap which took years to reach from halve in the next five years her aim is to persuade companies that it is in their best interests to support womens careers because not doing so was a waste of a natural resource however the governments policy of relying on voluntary compliance by companies met with a mixed response gail cartmail equalities officer for the manufacturing and science and finance union said left to their own devices employers will do nothing to bridge the pay gap compulsory pay audits are the only way forward john monks tuc general secretary called on the government to introduce legisla tion if the voluntary approach failed to work but the cbi said employers should not get all the blame the main causes are the large numbers of women working in lowpaid sectors and many women take career breaks or work parttime because of childcare responsibilities said its director of human resources

women workers were today expected to be given new rights to find out if male colleagues are paid more in a move aimed at closing the gender pay gap companies refusing to provide information could be taken to an employment tribunal the plan is to encourage a more open culture in the workplace so that women can find out if they are being paid comparable rates to colleagues of similar experience trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt is expected to make the announcement as part of her response to a report by denise kingsmill the governments advisor on equal pay unions will welcome the move although they want the government to go further and force employers to conduct pay reviews to make sure women are not being paid less than men the kingsmill report is expected to recommend naming and shaming companies which fail to take action to close the pay gap between men and women ms hewitt told bbc radio s today programme what we are doing is putting in place through the employment bill an equal pay questionnaire which will mean that instead of going off to a tribunal to find out whether or not you are getting equal pay you can actually ask your employer in the first place this is nothing to do with red tape it is about making sure that women in the workplace can find out whether they are getting fair pay compared with men doing the same job if they find out with that information that they are getting equal pay we will avoid unnecessary tribunal cases if the employer didnt intend to discriminate it may trigger him to look at the problem and to deal with his pay structure where a woman brings an equal pay claim she is entitled to get that information in any case ms hewitt said that the legislation would not allow employees to go on fishing expeditions to find out the pay scales of people in different jobs which she said would be a breach of privacy she said that the new rules would help establish whether bonuses were being awarded in a discriminatory way

the government today announced moves aimed at closing the gender pay gap saying it wanted to prevent women facing a stark choice between being a mother and a successful employee firms were urged to launch pay reviews to make sure their female employees are not being underpaid larger companies will have to publish details of how they train and recruit staff under proposals unveiled by the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt women will also find it easier to get information from their employers about whether they are being paid less than their male colleagues companies refusing to provide information could be taken to an employment tribunal though there will also be legislation to prevent employees going on fishing expeditions to find out the pay scales of people in different jobs ms hewitt said there was much more to do to close the pay gap between men and women which now stands at unequal pay was not a problem that could be fixed overnight because it differed between industries occupations regions and people of different ages she said our proposals will help but what is also needed is a cultural change among employers to properly value womens contribution to business success she said that too many women were becoming detached from wellpaid jobs by motherhood they end up losing out and it is reflected in the continuing pay gap the government is determined to ensure that women do not have to face a stark choice she said the womens minister barbara roche added that the government wanted women to reach their full potential and was determined to give them more choices about how they balance work and home responsibilities the governments equal pay adviser denise kingsmill prepared a report leading to todays announcement based on consultations with

working women are to get new legal rights to find out whether male colleagues earn more than them as part of a government crusade to close the pay gap between the sexes patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary will target the secrecy shrouding some workplaces where discussion of salary is banned allowing employers to get away with underpaying women she will also promise action to stop women in highly paid careers dropping out when they have children and taking menial posts that fit around family life she will call for an end to the excessive long hours culture in british offices hewitt who will unveil plans at a summit of unions and employers on wednesday will ask her own cabinet colleagues to lead the way by tackling excessive working hours in whitehall the fundamental problem as she sees it is women being detached from highquality posts through motherhood said a source close to hewitt the evidence shows the pay gap is bigger among lower social groups poorer paid unskilled workers and thats where our main focus is denise kingsmill the governments adviser on equal pay will also seek to name and shame firms failing to act on equal pay when she unveils the findings of a review on closing the pay gap she wants companies to be forced to publish their strategies on women employees pay and prospects in their annual reports embarrassing unenlightened employers into action the idea risks being unpopular with business however and hewitt will say it needs further consideration kingsmill will also recommend voluntary moves employers could take to show they are serious such as making senior managers bonuses dependent on ensuring equal pay for staff or encouraging flexible working for mothers the moves follow a string of highprofile pay battles including the recent case of julie bower an investment analyst with schroder securities she resigned after getting a bonus of only when two male analysts received million between them a tribunal found the amount was calculated and intended to make her feel unwanted and that she would not have been treated in that way but for the fact that she was a woman schroders was found guilty of sex discrimination and compensation yet to be set could be up to m controversially hewitt is expected to admit that the pay gap women earn p for every pound a man does may never be entirely closed kingsmill has suggested only that it could be halved in five years the key however will be kingsmills ideas on making it easier for women to win fair wages without going to industrial tribunal she has recommended that women be able to force disclosure from their bosses of how much a named male colleague earns however the government fears this would breach mens right to privacy instead the forthcoming employment bill will give female staff statutory rights to ask employers if equivalent men in the firm are paid more than them without the exact amount being disclosed in some companies disclosing salaries to peers is banned leaving women unaware that they are underpaid employers refusing to answer could be taken to tribunal with their refusal counting against them in the ruling ministers hope that in most cases bosses will simply give in without a tribunal being necessary the new rights stop short of demands from the equal opportunities commission and the tuc that firms be forced to carry out pay reviews comparing all workers salaries the government has firmly rejected the idea unions also fear kingsmill has focused on highpaid corporate women while per cent of the pay gap involves women in the two lowest social classes meanwhile the cbi is expected to resist any form of compulsion on employers to close the pay gap it is too easy to say it is the employers fault it
