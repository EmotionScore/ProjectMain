when my eldest daughter was just a few months old i threw her in a carrier and took her on a train to visit my friend the chorus of sisters are doin it for themselves looping in my head i arrived giddy and smug in the notion that my adorable new addition hadnt disrupted my life one bit placed her in the crib set up in my friends guestroom put my hand on the doorknob and thats when she started to scream which she did for the entire night twelve hours fourteen hours could have been i lost count id never seen her so furious id never seen her so continuously awake cradling her hot red squalling body in those first few minutes my instinct was to sing her the lullaby that had become part of our bedtime ritual tender shepherd from peter pan tender shepherd tender shepherd let me help you count your sheep one in the meadow two in the garden three in the nursery fast asleep fast asleep it did not have the intended effect i briefly entertained the idea that my solo singing was unsatisfactory my husband and i back in those innocent days of having just one child and not three would often sing it as a round my friend came in to help we sang together the babys skin tone turned from rose to crimson i banished all helpers from the room and for the subsequent hours sang about ruminant animals as my baby wailed at some point i realized shed conked out but curled into the fetal position myself i continued to mumblewhispersing insisting that wed both remain calm that everything was going to be ok that wed be sleepy sheep soon enough lullabies are curious songs often about unthinkable tragedies and somber realities babies crashing down in cradles that are strung up in trees poor darling clementine whos lost and gone forever a troubled love affair that takes someones sunshine away many part of a tradition that for centuries had to factor in the commonness of infant death of a life that was unpredictable and often bleak seeking to understand more about the power of my nightly singing ritual to my preschooler amid an unpredictable and often bleak pandemic my current hodgepodge lineup features billy joels lullabye a lethargic bushel and a peck from guys and dolls and baby beluga i headed to the library there i found a crispy yellowpaged little book called lullabies published in by one fe budd which collects lullabies from to and affirms their lessthancheery heritage in the intro the key to which their music is attuned is that of subdued elegiac lament rather than of lyric rapture budd writes the spirit that they foster is one of stoical resignation in the face of impending calamity a quality of mind that enables a man to go through with things even if he sees no prospect of a successful issue sweet dreams not that all of them are that rough but even our modern choices as i confirmed after an informal poll of friends are often random and a bit odd one landed on a spanish song seor don gato for her newborn its about a cat whos sitting on the roof where he learns his beloved will marry him in his excitement he falls off dies and then is resurrected when he smells the fish stand in the market as his funeral procession passes by mmmkay another sings the streets of laredo to his infant despite him not being a cowboy or having any cowboys in his lineage hes an engineer you dont have to have a profound connection to a song for it to stick and on the flip side lullabies dont always carry down from generation to generation i tried amazing grace with my child which my father used to sing to me and couldnt get past the wretch part without crying because of the melody because of something etched deep in my being that remembers being cradled in my fathers arms perhaps its that the song is often associated with grief dunno dont care i simply cant end every day weeping hence raffi the thing about singing to a child i learned is that its arguably as important to the singers as it is to the listeners something we parents should take note of as we seek to quell our raging anxiety just me programs like carnegie halls lullaby project which pairs parents and parentstobe with professional artists to write personal lullabies encourage new parents to sing sing sing cradling a child and singing is a onestopshop for bonding and connection it involves the kinesthetic the audio the visual and has been shown to support maternal health and child development and in medical settings the upsides are obvious lullabies positively influence cardiac and respiratory function in premature babies and they lower the heart rates of anxious caregivers making them a nearzerocost way to calm distress the first sound a person hears before theyre born is the rhythm of the mothers heartbeat the whoosh of the womb and their mothers voice dr joanne loewy told me when i reached her by phone theres neurologic evidence that a mother singing to a baby is the foundation for attachment loewy has served as the director of the louis armstrong center for music amp medicine at new yorks mount sinai hospital for the last years where she oversees clinical work and research into the importance of music therapy one area of study involves what she calls the song of kin which might have been passed down through generations or be the parents wedding song or a favorite song from childhood she likened it to a special ingredient that when sung by the parent or any loving caregiver imparts profound meaning to the child while what defines a lullaby is complex theyre often in rhythm but many parents change the rhythm throughout the day making it jaunty in the morning and more soporific at night what matters is the act of singing itself whatever the time cuing into the mood of that child collaborating calibrating the music in real time thats where communication begins and is sustained loewy said the effect of singing is so powerful in humans she told me that stroke patients who have lost the ability to speak can be moved to sing if they hear a melody they remember their neural pathways lighting up like a christmas tree alzheimers patients too as for pandemicera lullaby singing its potency is much deeper because there is so much stress in daytoday action now loewy told me the ritual of singing before bed with those elongated vowels it can have amazing outcomes my preschooler developed a crouplike cough last week that gave her a husky smokers rasp and woke her up multiple times per night hacking away and crying she kept testing negative for covid and yet as i rushed down the hall to her room in the wee hours my head would flood with concerns that ranged from the relatively anodyne how will this upend our schedules to the most profound what if she ends up at the wrong side of the fraction after getting her some water and wiping her nose id pick her up cradle her and sing for her yes but i now realize for me too sophie brickman is a contributor to the new yorker the new york times and other publications

parents of adult children who sit down to do their tax return this weekend should check if they are due a refund one guardian reader has just discovered hm revenue and customs is taxing him as if his family is still getting child benefit even though his two children are now and and the family stopped receiving the cash almost months ago his case is similar to one featured in guardian money a year ago involving a woman with a daughter in her s who received a tax rebate because hmrc had wrongly carried on making deductions for child benefit for several years earlier this week hmrc said million people had still not filed their selfassessment tax return and paid any tax owed ahead of what is still officially the deadline monday january however it was announced recently that those who file late will not be hit with a penalty provided their return is submitted by february child benefit is currently paid at a week for the eldest or only child then a week for each additional child and is worth a year for a family with two children you normally qualify if you are responsible for a child under or under if they stay in approved fulltime education or training which includes alevels lots of families have been pulled into selfassessment because at least one parent has an income of more than under the governments highincome child benefit charge the payout is clawed back on a sliding scale the highincome tax charge is of the amount of child benefit for each of income on a sliding scale between and for those earning more than the charge is in effect they receive no child benefit the reader did his tax return a few days ago and was amazed to be told he was owed for overpaid tax for he has two children and has been affected by the tax charge for several years however his younger child stopped being eligible for the benefit in september shortly after leaving sixth form the refund related to deductions that hmrc had continued to make for child benefit even though he became free of the tax charge a few months into the tax year his tax code notice letters for mentioned child benefit and when he visited govuk to look at his personal tax account it stated that his current code includes a deduction of for child benefit this suggests he will be due another refund of at least several hundred pounds for his case shows the importance of checking your tax code to make sure it is correct for your situation and not based on outdated or incorrect information many people file their tax code notice letters away without looking at them closely or at all hmrc previously told guardian money that paye collects the correct amount of tax for the vast majority of customers and that it will change someones tax code if it is notified of a change in

to introduce ourselves i burst into tears and said i cant do it she struggled with feelings of guilt and shame many women with pnd feel as if they have failed their children or are not living up to societal expectations of proper parenting before i had kids says leach i used to think about how i couldnt wait to stop working and stay home with my children and then there was this big shock of being at home and realising that i hated it over time the support group became a lifeline its peer support so many mums come in to the group and make friends and help each other she says everyone makes you feel so at ease leach is now a volunteer facilitator with the group using her experience to support other mums struggling with pnd she helps run two groups a week and also assists with arts and crafts programmes she supported so many mums online during lockdown says tracey edwards of homestart as well as completing two mental health training courses and homeschooling three children shes

it wasnt enough she says they got me another two sessions but that was it they said that if you still need help youll have to go back on the waiting list but i didnt feel better it would have been nice to do cbt until i felt better at the group leach tells women theres always hope there are people out there who feel like i did she says i want them to know its ok and they wont feel like this for ever after so many years of attending and then leading the group leach feels incredibly strongly about the power of community at leachs request we arrange a spa day i never get to be pampered she says the greenway hotel and spa in cheltenham offers her a complimentary spa package i didnt know what to do with myself when i got there says leach because im not used to that sort of thing but when i relaxed i enjoyed it she swam in the pool basked in the steam rooms and had a facial and a massage it does you the world of good doesnt it says leach i felt really happy afterwards it was a bit of time for myself it is a fitting treat says leach because the importance of taking time away from the kids often comes up in her support groups we always say to the mums they need to find time for

as a mother to three boys there are many days when i question the decisions i make sometimes the weight of that the idea your childs wellbeing and happiness rests with you can feel crippling at the same time we are bombarded by parents publicising their own pride in their offsprings achievements on instagram and facebook and in whatsapp groups meaning its easy to feel as if everyone else knows what theyre doing the idea that people sometimes feel like impostors at work is often discussed yet the parental impostor syndrome many people have that they are faking it and will never cut it as a parent is seldom acknowledged the psychologist linda blair explains in two psychotherapists came up with the concept of impostor syndrome loosely defining it as doubting your abilities and not feeling good enough there is a lot of research around impostor syndrome at work and this falls under that same umbrella now i am hearing about this a lot more in clinic partly because of social media and fakebook parents ranee lives in southwest london with her husband and their two adopted children ranee is of sri lankan heritage and her husbands family are from mauritius because of this it took a long time for them to be matched with their children as many councils are keen to match the ethnic backgrounds of potential parents and children during that time ranee and her husband went through a rigorous vetting process yet when the process was complete and they were a family with children she felt disoriented by how much she didnt know i remember walking into the playground and thinking everyone knows youre not a real mum she says upon taking her fiveyearold to school for the first time it was as if i had a siren above me or fake written on my forehead just trying to talk to parents on a playdate or wondering what other kids would eat was tricky my children were really picky eaters and all of this made me think i didnt know what i was doing she says she had done courses and read books to try to prepare but nothing quite readied her for the experience of becoming a parent i didnt have any mum friends and id gone straight from working to being a stayathome mum i kept thinking does everyone feel like this is this how it is ranee a food photographer says now that the adoption is completed her impostor syndrome has largely gone occasionally it comes back when were dealing with school issues but i now have a network of friends who have also adopted and that has helped me gain some perspective as well as the fact that she and her husband went from a couple to parents of two in one day ranee thinks anxiety about whether she was doing things right played a big role in feeling like an impostor i sometimes felt as if there was a model parent out there but i learned to lower my expectations and understood that my children dont know any different i now subscribe to good enough parenting i know i will make mistakes and i have to forgive myself and not get het up i used to want to run out of the playground and hide under the bed but ive learned that you just have to set your own standard trust that you will be a great parent and fight your childrens corner one day youll fail the next day youll feel less of a failure and so on until it normalises years later she says things look very different i have two amazing kids who are teenagers and i know they will forge their own lives and i just want them to be happy lucille lives in suffolk and has five children its hard to imagine someone with so much parenting experience could feel as if she were a fake who could be found out but she says social media often leaves her feeling that she is not good enough im my own worst enemy because my impostor syndrome is selfimposed she says its so easy to scroll through perfect facebook photos and instagrammable moments and forget that a lot of it is smoke and mirrors and nobody has everything that sorted growing up i wanted children more than i wanted to breathe so five children and nine miscarriages later in a lot of ways this is everything i dreamed of but i dont know if im ever going to feel like ive achieved enough blair says this is something she has heard before it is the job of social media to present your best face so we get a skewed version of parenting she says one of the things i advise is to try to limit social media or complement it with facetoface conversation with other parents this way you will get a real picture of what is going on and people are more likely to be honest lucille is a jewellery designer and lives with chronic pain owing to a medical condition her husband works long hours meaning much of the parenting falls to her she is also home schooling her youngest because he is at risk of anaphylaxis for most of our waking hours its me myself and five people look at me in horror when i tell them this but it works for us what has put everything into context she says is not just time but the tough situations they have weathered over the past months we nearly lost elijah to his anaphylaxis we all caught covid twice and my eldest alex found an unexplained lump in his arm which gave us an awful scare the fear at times has been unreal but as a parent all these challenges have helped me realise that i can hold it together through just about anything with five children ive had a chance to learn from my mistakes i know that i can deal with just about anything thrown at me but that doesnt mean i feel like im nailing it i just try my best blair points out that being a parent doesnt necessarily get easier even with several children many techniques you learn are only temporary they may work at first but then children grow circumstances change and they stop being effective you have to learn to forgive yourself because they change my husband adnan is he wanted to make it clear that its not just mothers who can feel like impostors in their home life i had the fairytale illusion of what id be like as a dad he says when our first child was born i had images of all this stuff wed do together it didnt include pictures of sleepless nights or every item of clothing being covered in snot and yoghurt he also says it doesnt get any easier with more children because each child will have a different personality requiring different methods of parenting theres a fine line between child management focusing on health and safety and being a present dad trying to listen to all their voices he says no one explains that youre their protector as well as the person meeting their hygiene factors feeding them listening to playground politics and building their confidence youre the person who is the narrative in their head about how great they are adnan says that though he doesnt compare himself with other parents he still finds it hard to shake the fairytale that is firmly in his head and compared with which he always comes up short the continuous refereeing and the delegate decisionmaking goes beyond anything ive done in the workplace i keep asking myself am i equipped to deal with this im a father a counsellor a coach autocratic and democratic theres also something about being a parent in your s you dont have the physicality of your s blair who raised three children herself says her advice in these circumstances is to spend time with each child on their own find a way every month or week to have an hour with just one child one on one go to a cafe after school or something like that they will remember that beyond everything else i used to do this with my children and it was just magic adam moved to the uk from zambia eight years ago with his wife and their three children adams wife is an architect and spends much of her time in zambia while he stays at their home in carterton in oxfordshire to look after the children i had my first child at and i have a yearold daughter who was five when i married her mum and who i adopted when she was eight he says coming to the uk i quickly started to feel inferior to other usually much younger parents who seemed to be effortlessly successful in everything careers family etc and this continues on a practical level there was plenty of help in the early years in zambia nannies were easily available and there was lots of open space in his calmer moments adam can be realistic about his own skills i do believe that i have done a reasonable job the kids are all thankfully well adjusted reasonably hard working very sociable yet he says he is haunted at other times by thoughts that he could be doing so much better for his childrenbecause i came to fatherhood later on and because we were mostly so far away i never really had the chance to share my experiences of parenting with my contemporaries here so when we came to the uk most of them had moved on with kids at university and i felt quite alone i have been suffering with depression on and off for years and it often manifests itself through crippling lack of selfesteem my children are truly wonderful i like to think they would tell you that i am the best dad ever its just that often i seem unable to accept that myself blair agrees we need to figure out our unique identity when we grasp this everything becomes easier we think we have to live to other peoples rules but then we feel inadequate when we dont meet the mark all the parenting books are templates you have to invent your own way of parenting because every child is unique good enough parenting theory is a great way of looking at things she says perfect parents dont actually produce the best children the mistakes we make give our children space to grow into better adults things to rebel against and it helps them forge their personality the psychotherapist philippa perry says that as a society we have become a lot more selfobsessed putting ourselves at the centre of the relationship instead of our children which is unhelpful we all love our children but what we need to do is respect them we kid ourselves if we think that we have control we havent got control but what we do have is control over how we behave and we need to behave in an authentic and respectful manner with our children we need to be partners in our endeavours respect your childrens time and respect each other exhaustion can make us forget that we are no longer the most important people in our world for those of us privileged to be parents maybe we just need to simplify things as we navigate life alongside the little people entrusted to us and see ourselves through their eyes the londonbased therapist michelle qureshi has some words of wisdom too accept yourself as a human ditch the comparing with other parents say to yourself overall i do a good job and they do too dont let your

the parent trap is a charming family film that will appeal to adults and kids alike but please dont use it as an instructional manual on how to raise children an american winery owner and a british dressmaker enjoy a whirlwind romance and a quickfire wedding only to get divorced shortly after the birth of their twin daughters rather than work out a shared custody deal they instead decide it is in the best interests of their baby girls to split the twins up take them to different sides of the world and then never inform either of the existence of the other and if that wasnt traumatising enough neither daughter is given any information about their absent parent being raised in a world of repression and whispers being a disney film any parental deceit is swept under the rug as are the logistics that see both children coincidentally sent to the same remote summer camp a few months shy of their th birthdays much like the original on which this version is based the two sisters are played by one young actor lindsay lohan in her stunning film debut and the girls take an instant dislike to each other a series of escalating and unlikely pranks ensue including one in which a tween is somehow able to hoist an entire cabins worth of furniture bunk beds and all on to the roof and glue it all in place and the two are punished by being kept alone in an isolated cabin on the edge of

again this time to get their parents together in the same place at the same time while also ridding their father of his golddigging childhating cruellastyle girlfriend who is really blocking their happily ever after the rest of the film is a series of mishaps hijinks mislaid plans and disasters and obviously a happy ending its such an enjoyable movie that the disney of it all actually adds to the appeal this is also by far the best performance lindsay lohan has ever committed to celluloid remarkable considering its not only her debut but that shes performing two roles one with a believable british accent the other as a knockabout tomboy and doing so largely to a green screen its quite amusing too that lohan was cast in this double role given that the biggest young stars at the time were literally a set of yearold twins but while the olsens were lovably wooden i cannot stress how lovably brilliant lohan is here turn a blind eye to the series of parental flaws that would have both

telling our son that he was soon going to have a little sister was one of those rare moments where we got the sort of heartwarming reaction wed hoped as parents i mean but certainly not as someone who hopes to write a palatably relatable column hes continued choosing names for her pizza has now overtaken both alexander and blueberry in his top tier and insisting quite sweetly that hell be a doting big brother once she arrives proving it by holding toys outstretched to his mums stomach it is in short the cutesiness of one who has learned he will curry special favour by appearing adorable still we do find it adorable so the victory is his i shudder to include such stories because even i find that level of wholesome cheeriness a bit much look i want to relate the sweet things he does because hes a lovely nice boy of whom i am very fond but if i veer too far into the saccharine stuff i picture my cruel and cynical readership retching in their droves blemishing this paper or screen with vomit in the process it behoves me to mask such sweetness with the thin veneer of crotchety snark that lets me have my cake and eat it week after week you know oh i love him but he gets yoghurt everywhere and has started killing small rodents that kind of thing its a tactic thats served me well for a while now and i dont much feel like retiring it which was making his absurdly charming reaction to news of his baby sister not just narratively inconvenient but professionally embarrassing luckily he stepped up to the plate yesterday by offending me quite profoundly his charming if slightly invasive habit of kissing his mums stomach and whispering hello to his baby sister led him to do the same to my pale belly tugging at and cooing over the child inside he has since graduated to shouting hellooooo into my belly button were not quite clear if he thinks im also pregnant or if we simply swap incubation duties on an ad hoc basis either way he cannot be dissuaded and now speaks often of my baby and even places a gentle hand on my stomach any time it comes within admiring distance ill try not to dwell too long on what led him to believe i his doting father could be with child because this very magazine paid me money to lose a bit of weight a couple of years ago and im vaguely worried theyll make me pay it all back if i confess that my build has rebounded to pregnancyconfusion levels i will simply continue to correct him and request he refer all such affection to his mother in the hopes he isnt upset to discover he has just the one sister arriving in a few months time for now im content to let him pat hug and slap my wobbly paunch after every large meal slap slap slap he goes its enough to make you sick did ye hear mammy died by samas oreilly is out

can somebody tell me why we have such a dichotomy in australia whereby parents love their babies and young children with a passion but on a national policy basis their needs and the needs of those that care for them are continually overlooked having assessed the evidence that covid appears to be a relatively mild illness in children it appears as if our commonwealth and state and territory governments have just never checked in to see how the services that care for them our early education and care childcare services are going how are they going the good news is that so far children are surviving despite almost children under the age of nine having caught covid in australia so far there have only been two deaths but when it comes to the services that care and educate our youngest children our long daycare services preschools family daycare services and outofschool hours care services and the educators and teachers that staff these services the news is less good since the very start of the pandemic the capacity of these services to stay afloat has been seriously at risk governments have continually put in shortterm financial aid to parents and services to keep their doors open but then they withdraw it because it was only ever a range of temporary patches over a gaping wound so here we are with covid ripping through the country and we have education and care services and the people that are staffing them once again going under financially they cant survive without further support if they have to keep waiving parents fees because the parents are keeping their children home out of fear or because they have to shut down because too many of their staff have covid or are close contacts every solution to this problem has been brought in on a temporary basis only because i dont know you cant keep making things free can you even if your economy and your health system desperately need childcare centres to keep their doors open the people who manage these services are frantically trying to ensure that they keep the children and babies in their care safe they must under the national quality framework they operate under quality area of this framework demands that services safeguard childrens health and safety minimise risks and protect children from harm and infection this is what they are required to always do even when we arent in the middle of a pandemic but in some states like nsw they have been told that staff no longer have to isolate if there is a positive case in their centre even if they have spent hours in the same room or with the positive child in their laps how can anyone ignore that this puts children and other staff at high risk of catching this blasted virus but no apparently you can only catch covid in homes not in a centre where hundreds of children spend the hours when they are not in their own homes one director told me this week that apparently the government believes covid is left in the car park of their centre and isnt allowed through the front door the directors and managers of the centres also have to juggle staff absences due to positive covid cases and close contact exposures outside of the centres but unlike say restaurants they cant just close their doors if they dont have enough staff to operate without having an impact on a load of other employees who need the care to turn up for their own jobs young human beings cant just be left without adult care unfortunately for the economy ask the parents of the odd centres that have had to close so far how they feel about suddenly being left without care and then the directors and managers have all the normal issues like struggling to find food to feed the children in their care given bare supermarket shelves the need to find rats on the private market to test their staff and highquality masks for the educators that children climb over and hug on a daily basis every day they are sent updated information about how they are supposed to operate from the government departments that regulate and fund them the one thing this information avalanche lacks is clear guidance and support you hear a lot in the media about school education and whether children should return to school now or later you hear a lot about the rollout of the vaccination program for children aged from five to you hear about ventilation in schools or the lack thereof but you dont hear much about children under five who are after all unable to be vaccinated at all you dont hear much about what is happening in the centres that are desperately trying to keep these children safe you dont hear much about how our early childhood educators and teachers are faring you dont hear much about the rats that were promised to these centres by governments that havent yet arrived you dont hear much about how the women of the staff are in fact women who provide care and education to our youngest children and who manage these centres for wages that are among the lowest in australia are coping but maybe you should because the answer is not very well we used to have a world where women and children were protected apparently that went out about the same time as coughing in public did lisa bryant is an advocate for education and care in australia and a consultant to education and care services,2022-01,somebody tell dichotomy australia whereby parent love baby

raising my daughter through this teenage stage is scary and i dont know if i will get through it these years in the thick of raising teenagers are a little like the first years of parenthood you once again feel overwhelmed and incompetent there is also the aloneness sometimes when i admit to another parent that this is hard harder than i expected they lower their heads near mine and with eyes widened whisper urgently about something very worrying they are contending with as a parent their voices convey the relief of an honest conversation but also the ache of big problems that cannot be immediately fixed for a child the aloneness we felt when we were raising babies was about maintaining the facade that babies werent softening us too much or that the days were filled with nothing but joy now the aloneness is about being discreet teenagers have a right to privacy and rebirth as they muddle along while adolescent impulsiveness is entirely predictable poor choices are still judged very harshly by the rest of the world i do not know if the world is getting more complex to raise teenagers in or if it has long been this fraught i dont know because like i said no one talks about this part of parenting with much real honesty i recently asked a close friend for advice she was facing a tough time of her own as a mother but she said reassuringly it is probably like that book we read over and over to our children when they were little were going on a bear hunt in the book a young family go on an adventure to find a bear the plot resembles the motivations you fabricate to keep the energy of small children up on long walks we are walking why to find a bear of course when you are walking with small children even the simplest of walks present challenges every bit of mud or water that you manage to get through without a child falling over in it feels like an achievement so it always made sense to me that the book focuses more on the obstacles of the walk than the dangers of a bear and each time the family is deterred by new terrain the book repeats the mantra we cant go over it we cant go under it weve got to go through it when i used to read that story to my children i assumed its appeal lay in the whimsical sense of drama and singsong lessons in prepositions and spatial concepts but maybe the book was written for parents rereading it as the mother of a yearold daughter it seems obvious that its true purpose is imprinting a script for living and so i now look with curiosity at the depictions of mother and daughter in the book in one part of the story the family are making their way through an overgrown field the mother and the little daughter with their arms stretched towards one another are holding hands but are swallowed chestdeep into long grass is the daughter showing her mother the way or is the mother helping her daughter through the grass we cannot assume by this stage of parenting teenagers that we as parents always know what is best i am reminded of a quietly haunting poem by lucille clifton my mama moved among the days describing the experience of being the child of a mother who is unravelling the mother does her best she got us almost through the high grass before tragically succumbing to something terrible inside herself and running back into the grass alone my own experience with mothering a teenage daughter is that there is a lot of pushpull she still wants to hold my hand but she is insistent that she knows the right way ahead through the long grass so when i look at that illustration in the bear hunt story i see a mother trying to pull her daughter back from a dangerous course i try to explain this fear to my daughter carefully so as not to offend her how it feels to not only be scared as a parent but also unexpectedly powerless my daughter and i were walking our dogs offleash when i told her about a fear in the united states real or imaginary that dogs can be lured away from their owners by coyotes whether the dog follows a coyote for play or out of bravado we cannot say but the result is they underestimate the small impish creature until finding themselves isolated and surrounded by a pack of them then far from their owners protection they are killed her mouth dropped in horror that is how it sometimes feels to be a parent i told her i am trying to call you back to warn you of the dangers in the world but you are disappearing into the long grass of course my daughter is not like a pet she is not mine she is becoming her own person and i deliberately sought not to raise my daughter to be too fearful of the world lest she curb her participation in it as a young woman but the youthful underestimation my corresponding powerlessness and the collision of all this with a world not as kind as i hoped for my children are proving to be a daunting combination for me as a mother what to do when i am feeling engulfed i remember the instruction of the book the resistance and avoidance are their own pain reaching acceptance that i will have to go through this and do the hard work involved is the only way for me to get to the other side my friend if this is you too i have these words for you keep going andie fox is a freelance writer who writes about motherhood from a feminist perspective,2022-01,raising daughter teenage stage scary dont know get year thick raising teenager little

how big is a baby dinosaur my son asks it depends i say but thats not really what we will it be green no were trying to tell you will it be as big as a bus conversations like this have been relatively frequent for the past few weeks since my wife and i told our son that we are expecting a baby i guess were telling you now too congratulations us were thrilled to be honest wed had a hard go of it second time round and were beginning to think it wasnt to be but then all of a sudden it was and now it is shes a little girl and at weeks we dont know an awful lot about her she seems nice has fingers and toes in the right places and appears to have a passion for thumbsucking we also know shes categorically not a dinosaur but its taking her older brother a while to get used to this wed already broken the one rule of these things which is not to phrase the news as a question would you like a little brother or sister wed asked him which received a cheerfully adamant no a couple of months ago luckily wed caught him in an off moment so by the time my wife started visibly showing we were able to tell him for the first time all over again in fact we ended up having to telltold him for the first time on three or four occasions i dont know what we expected ambivalence i suppose resentment disbelief but all we got was delight interrogation and a good deal of poking and prodding some nights he bounds over lacking the tact usually desirable when charging towards a pregnant woman and plants his ear to his mums stomach tuning out the world and hearing well not very much at all the fact that she will be a little girl seems exciting to him albeit a source of confusion he still refers to people of all genders as he with a patriarchal mindset we hope to dislodge through careful social programming mostly however shes it will it have blue eyes and red hair he asks on those evenings he has grasped she will not be a dinosaur we tell him we dont know and ask what he would prefer he thinks she should be bright white but with black eyes and her name should be pizza this preference will last a few minutes before he decides her name should be pea then minnie then baby alexander with no reason given for such choices he conjures these while bellyeared like an eavesdropping butler in an edwardian farce or a survivalist listening to the ground for news of a storm he says thoughtful adoring things like hello and shhhh and what are you he has even been known to sidle up and kiss said belly in a display so selfconsciously adorable its hard not to believe he knows exactly what hes doing as we consider the pitfalls and anxieties of going round the newborn carousel again were not sure what to think ourselves can it be a dog my son asks sure we have concerns and worries

really good way of teaching them the value of money at an early age barclays research found many parents start giving their child a small amount when they turn seven many of the parents we surveyed

theres a moment in the lost daughter maggie gyllenhaals adaptation of the elena ferrante novel which stars olivia colman where i gasped out loud and swore at the character colmans leda a professor holidaying in greece alone is conversing awkwardly with a pregnant stranger children are a crushing responsibility she says by way of a conversational coda the bluntness of colmans delivery meant that i was laughing as i gasped but still everyone knows it to be on some level true but you dont go around saying such things to pregnant women or at least you shouldnt the netflix film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel it holds the same capacity to shock while bringing out new feelings and elucidations the moment in the film where one of ledas daughters cuts her finger and repeatedly begs her mother a younger leda played by jessie buckley to kiss it better is far more emotionally affecting than when described in the slim interior novel poor creatures who came out of my belly leda narrates in the book and as a cinematic audience at times we are inclined to agree with her because what sort of mother abandons her children as leda does is maternal ambivalence still a taboo some insist that it is though a woman failing to love her children as society deems she should is hardly a new story either in literature or reality maternal cruelty is still shocking whether it comes in the form of a performance of medea or another heartbreaking headline case of child murder or neglect for some even having mixed feelings about motherhood warrants punishment rachel cusks adaptation of medea at the almeida theatre featured a chorus of conforming yummy mummies cusk herself was castigated by such a chorus for a lifes work her book which committed the crime of being honest about how exhausting and miserable it was to have a baby who cried unceasingly hardly a controversial revelation or at least not by todays standards again and again people judged the book not as readers but as mothers cusk later wrote in recent years there has been a proliferation of awarenessraising about maternal ambivalence especially postnatal depression courageous women have spoken out and written about it defying what cusk describes as the tendency of the communal to prevail over the individual when it comes to motherhood these women are brave because the voices that contradict a powerful cultural myth are so often castigated eventually these voices formed their own chorus and the taboo itself is weakening or at least it seems that way to me yet these works maintain an emotional force perhaps because now with our greater understanding we know just how close so many mothers have come to being driven mad by it perhaps we worry our own mothers were it is not a comfortable feeling and the lost daughter is not a comfortable film leda is not held up for judgment by us though at times the audience may of course judge her in a recent adaptation of nancy mitfords the pursuit of love maternal abandonment is played for laughs in the form of the character of the bolter fannys mother who flees any form of commitment it is tonally entirely different to the lost daughter but again simple judgment is the least interesting reaction one can have it feels less scandalous these days to admit that women can have other interests besides childrearing and that finding a way to reconcile making art in particular with the division of domestic labour is a worthy source of creative exploration works such as lara feigels free woman which explores doris lessings maternal ambivalence she abandoned two of her children as well as her own have added to this conversation as have novels by sheila heti jenny offill and avni doshi among others yet the death of joan didion saw a resurgence of the caitlin flanagan article in which she puts didions childcare arrangements under the microscope where was quintana when didion was living at the faculty club or finishing her novels at her parents house or bunking down in the haight flanagan asks not with her mother those four words drip with judgment the children stared at me leda narrates towards the end of the novel the lost daughter i felt their gazes longing to tame me but more brilliant was the brightness of life outside them new colours new bodies new intelligence a language to possess finally as if it were my true language and nothing nothing that seemed to me reconcilable with that domestic space from which they stared at me in expectation ferrante remains the empress of maternal ambivalence it comes down to language in the days of abandonment the narrator olga describes the experience of breastfeeding i was like a lump of food that my children chewed without stopping a cud made of a living material that continually amalgamated and softened its living substance to allow two greedy bloodsuckers to nourish themselves to read such words still feel like a forceful visceral refutation a scream in the face of the prevailing narrative many women will no doubt read those lines and reflect that isnt how it was for me but i hope that we are moving away from a place where one womans experience is taken to automatically undermine anothers most women will not abandon their children as leda does but many of us know that a more complex rendering of motherhood on screen and on the page can only be a good thing for us all after all it is when feelings are deemed unutterable that they become suffocating rhiannon lucy cosslett is a guardian columnist,2022-01,moment lost daughter maggie gyllenhaals

in the middle of a question and answer session at an academic symposium an audience member wearing a boss baby shirt showed off the boss baby lunchbox he takes to work every day obviously i eat cookies for lunch he explained because thats what boss baby fans do there was polite applause boss baby fans dont just eat cookies for lunch they also convene virtual philosophy conferences dedicated to the study of the boss baby the dreamworks animated film starring alec baldwin organised by jaime mccaffrey of the university of kentucky and tore levander of fordham university the first annual boss baby symposium held online on tuesday brought together a wide range of thinkers to examine what we can learn from a movie about a baby who is also a boss over the course of an entire afternoon eight academics delivered presentations centred around three themes situating the boss baby in myth and media personal and professional growth work and play in the boss baby and not enough love for the two of us birth motherhood and the lack thereof they were joined at the end for an informal chat with jp karliak voice of boss baby in the netflix television series the boss baby back in business and its showrunner or boss baby boss baby brandon sawyer frankly we dont know exactly what youll find the symposiums website admitted but we know it will leave you thinking yep that was definitely a symposium dedicated to the film titled the boss baby it was but why the boss baby depends on who you ask according to one of the symposiums presenters its just the continuation of a long historical lineage of boss babies or child leaders in the ancient greek stretching from astyanax from the iliad hikaru genji from the tale of genji king edward v of england and richard of shrewsbury duke of york regardless of why theres definitely a strong appeal at work the film grossed half a billion dollars at the box office and has since been spun off into a sequel and four seasons of the netflix television series kpop band bts member jimin learned english by watching the movie again and again and when a boss baby balloon floated on to the macys parade a transfixed crowd reverently chanted boss baby in nearreligious supplication despite this semiironic popularity the boss baby follows a plot that can be difficult to parse not that that would discourage academics it might be thematically richer than the bible and more confusing than ulysses mccaffrey said in her opening remarks in the movie the suitandtiewearing briefcasebearing boss baby is sent on a secret mission by baby corp where all babies come from hes charged with protecting the worlds love of babies now under threat due to increasing love for puppies instead so he sets out to stop the ceo of puppy co from releasing the forever puppy a new version of puppy that remains a puppy for life which would destroy babydom as we know it and for some reason is going to be launched into the world via a rocket filled to bursting with puppies thats a rough summary that doesnt even touch on things like the super secret baby formula that keeps the boss baby eternally young while endowing him with adult faculties it would take a phd just to understand how thats supposed to work let alone to conduct a freudian and marxist analysis of the milk as two academics did for the talk the land of milk and money lactic capital in the boss baby perplexing as the plot may be the first annual boss baby symposium urged us to not throw out the boss baby with the boss bathwater by the end of the day wed learned about everything from intertextual references in dreamworks movies and us attitudes towards sexuality to erik eriksons stages of psychosocial development we even sat down for a serious chat about boss babys narcissistic and psychotic orientation which to be fair doesnt really seem like a rare phenomenon among upper management it was during a presentation on the french philosopher jeanpaul sartres concept of play that it all twigged for me the speaker had been arguing that an authentic existential attitude is predicated on a synthesis of facticity boss and transcendence baby i realised that the symposium itself embodied what it means to truly be both boss and baby the presentations were both tongueincheek larks for a laugh and sincere explorations of the speakers areas of expertise there was genuine affection for the film as well as a willingness to make fun of it it was serious boss but it was also silly baby i wouldnt go so far as to say that the answers to all of lifes questions can be found in the boss baby but like the occasional cookie for lunch it doesnt hurt this article was amended on january to correct a misspelling of jaime mccaffreys surname,2022-01,middle question answer session

it is the unspoken promise of parenthood the deal millions make as their fledglings fly the nest that in an emergency they can always come fluttering back even if they never have to cash that unwritten cheque just knowing its there can be enough to see them through the wobbly early years of independence that place is home it is what gives young adults the confidence to flee a toxic relationship or a dodgy flatshare knowing theyre not going to end up on the street or to stick it out in the kind of insecure careers where persistence ultimately pays off but home isnt like that for everyone and shamefully its least like that for children parented by the state once they turn theyre no longer lookedafter children a euphemism already covering a multitude of sins but care leavers at best that means staying with a loving foster family until theyre ready to leave but at worst it means the kind of downhill slide that explains why too many rough sleepers have previously been in care almost half of care leavers have mental health issues and more than a third arent in education employment or training between the ages of and although the state now offers a personal adviser to guide them into their s with the best will in the world its not going to be like crying on a parental shoulder and thats the backdrop to the welsh governments brave and imaginative decision this week to trial a universal basic income ubi of a month equivalent to an annual salary of just over to care leavers brave because it invites not just predictable tabloid outrage at handing out money for nothing but also understandable resentment from workers slogging away at minimumwage jobs that they dont enjoy for the same money but imaginative because if it works which will mean coupling that money with the kind of intensive support and guidance that care leavers should frankly be getting anyway it opens up a much broader debate about the future of welfare its roadtesting an idea that will make instinctive sense to most parents which is that the emotional security money buys is not nothing indeed for some it might actually be everything a now famous trial of ubi for unemployed people in finland originally designed to test whether the carrot of free money was more effective than the stick of sanctions in getting people back into jobs found only a slight increase in days worked but a much bigger impact on happiness and health recipients reported less stress depression sadness and loneliness than the control group plus more confidence in the future more surprisingly they also reported higher cognitive skills things such as the ability to remember learn and concentrate and higher levels of trust in their fellow finns and in public institutions if buying happiness focus and trust doesnt sound like a terribly efficient use of public money then you are not thinking hard enough about how much unhappiness and all its spiralling consequences from anxiety and depression to drug and alcohol addiction relationship breakdown or the lifelong emotional and educational impact on childrens lives of having parents continually pushed to the limit costs the taxpayer or just how much public trust in institutions from the police to public health experts turned out to matter in a pandemic or how easily the politics of hate feeds off misery and suspicion whats interesting about the finnish findings is that they chime with research from developmental economists suggesting that giving away cold hard cash can be a surprisingly effective way of delivering aid as the dutch historian and ubi enthusiast rutger bregman has repeatedly argued the myth that poor people will only blow it on booze and cigarettes is just that people counting every penny tend to know exactly what theyd do with a bit more using it strategically and frugally if anything its grinding deprivation that drives humans towards bad choices and money that helps us make better ones lifting the fog of panic and exhaustion and helplessness that accompanies poverty and giving recipients the confidence to take risks the catch for ubi advocates however is that the magic of universal basic income may well lie in the last two words not the first for many the whole point is the universality or the dream that free money for everyone will miraculously engender a warm fuzzy feeling of togetherness even in those too wealthy to actually benefit because for them ubi would be effectively taxed away while delivering on the keynesian dream of prosperity buying everexpanding leisure but thats not where the evidence points the secret sauce seems to be providing people who just cant see another way out with enough free money to catch their breath and make plans an extra pittance for everyone regardless of need which is what every economically realistic proposal for ubi ive ever seen ends up apologetically boiling down to given the exorbitant cost is the worst of all worlds not quite enough to be meaningful to those who could really benefit but still too expensive to be politically plausible better to start by funding the existing welfare system properly recognising that the benefit cuts of the past decade went far too deep and left millions without enough to live on and then targeting those for whom the security of a basic income could be genuinely lifechanging in san francisco and vancouver there have been small but fascinating pilots involving free cash transfers to homeless people the success of furlough in keeping people attached to the workplace despite being temporarily out of a job suggests another possible avenue most people who lose their jobs arent out of work for long but for those who dont have savings even a few months on benefits that are a fraction of their normal salary mean racking up debt that can leave longterm scars some kind of timelimited basic income for newly redundant people could bridge that gap and give people a chance to retrain it could be useful too in softening the transition to net zero offering people who lose jobs in dying fossilfuel industries time to rethink their futures the possibilities are exciting but only if we let go of the utopian theory and focus relentlessly on what actually works its not about money for nothing its money for things that might just turn out to be priceless gaby hinsliff is a guardian

a friend who i thought was a close friend has been unsupportive following the recent death of my father we have been friends for years and while we dont live in each others pockets we are close friends who confide in each other i was the bridesmaid at her wedding when my father died recently while she did call to commiserate and send a kind text about him she did not make the effort to come to the funeral it is a twohour drive away unlike my other close friends while i can forgive that what i am struggling with is that almost two weeks later she has not contacted me to see how i am doing or whether i was ok after the funeral my father died close to christmas and all my friends except her texted me to say they were thinking of me which i really appreciated i dont expect my friends to get me through my grief i know everyone has their own life demands but i would have expected my close friend to be more supportive my mother and sister think i should cut her some slack as she is a good friend in other ways i just dont know how i can pretend that things are the same with her when i see her again please dont say have a conversation with her as conversations of that kind always affect a friendship anyway is there a way i can have a more superficial friendship with her eleanor says youre right that serious conversations always affect a relationship so i wont just say communicate i will say this isnt a failure unique to her many close relationships struggle after a bereavement each side of finding the other impossible to reach one explanation is the one that you gave death reveals that youre not as close as you thought another is that people just dont know what to say to someone bereaved really literally they dont know what to say people who are otherwise loving and perspicacious can get totally dumbstruck in the presence of grief i think its because death is so unflinchingly permanent nothing we can say will take it away and its hard to know how to help other people when we cant take away the source of their pain so many people just retreat at least that way they didnt fail a lot of people have found themselves standing where you do now bereaved and wondering why their friend doesnt call while the friend is wondering how it would possibly help if they did so the explanation for your friends behaviour might not be that she doesnt grasp the enormity of losing your dad it might be precisely because she understands it that something inside her has decided to run of course its only so useful to you to know why shes done this maybe shes felt paralysed in the way that ive described or maybe shes just being callous either way she didnt show up and that sucks thats a fact no matter what explains it but if as you write you want to have an ongoing relationship with this friend youre going to need a way to forgive her no relationship can survive the slow simmer of resentment least of all one thats trending into superficiality if you want to keep her in your life without smarting every time you see her it might help to interpret her actions here in the more generous way that interpretation might not be true but on the other hand it

she should have if she had called for instance you might have talked to your friend about your dad often after we lose someone its nice to talk about them instead of the fact that theyre gone so you could initiate that the next time you see her not with any nod to her absence on the topic just can i talk about my dad for a bit perhaps you can just use the chance to tell her who he was what you shared why youll miss him thats something she can listen to without feeling compelled to fix anything and it might give your relationship the sense that your bereavement has been heard friends fail us

asking my friends for parenting advice is tough because we all know next to nothing but good because we do at least agree what were doing is very hard and we should be proud of ourselves my dad by contrast is the exact opposite he doesnt really dispense parenting advice even though he had children and fostered half a dozen more hes basically the endlevel boss of dads the one you have to fight once youve dispatched tom hanks richard madeley and liam neesons character from taken theres nothing ive done as much or for as long as hes done parenting but when i ask him specific questions he always seems slightly bemused im having any trouble at all as if ive rung him up for a refresher course on tying my shoelaces just do what you think is best he said on the phone a few days ago when i related my trepidation around introducing the imminent baby to our son he uttered this with the sort of breezy dismissal that suggested hed feel more panicked sliding some keys off one fob and on to a different fob maybe deep investment in the small anxieties of fatherhood is just one of the first casualties of having so many children what can trepidation really mean to someone whos sat through more than school plays what could perturb a man who has been witness to the gory loss of baby teeth and had to shell out cold hard cash for each my fears about welcoming another child into our family fell on deaf ears not because my dad is unfeeling but because he has introduced a new baby to an older sibling no less than times and cant remember it ever being much of a problem my friends and i spend parenting chats nodding our frowning heads sympathetically riveted by the noble difficulties of our challenging lives and the fresh offering of new hurdles that come with every milestone not so my dad who had seven kids under by the time he was my age and spent a period between and living with six teenage daughters at once an experience which resulted in his capacity for anxiety being permanently cauterised should i get him a wee present from the baby i ask hoping this leading question will force some specific advice from him in a pathetic act of ventriloquism maybe he says but then youd better be ready for them to want a present from the baby every time they see them so prepare for that the financial sting of all those baby teeth clearly made its mark i think to myself my dad is of course merely a proponent of the theory that parents know better than they think they do and experience has taught him that worrying about every little thing is useless by the end of the call i know its the best advice i could receive precisely because it fails to flatter my problems the way i tend to prefer luckily i relate his responses to some friends the following day along with

grandparents planning hefty amounts of childcare this halfterm might want to think again after research claimed to disprove previous findings of a rejuvenating effect from looking after grandchildren many studies have appeared to show mental and physical health advantages for those who care for their grandchildren but none involved researchers talking to the same grandparents before and after their caregiving responsibilities began when the authors of is there a rejuvenating effect of grandchildcare a longitudinal study published this week in the journals of gerontology did that they found that caring for grandchildren failed to make grandparents feel any younger than their actual age the age people feel they are as opposed to the age on their birth certificate is seen as a strong indicator of their mental and physical wellbeing sometimes even outperforming chronological age as a direct predictor of psychological and healthrelated outcomes including risk of death this is the first study to look at the same people before and after taking up grandparental childcare in terms of the effects on subjective age said dr valeria bordone coauthor of the report bordone is also coauthor of a report do grandchildren influence how old you feel that found overs who take care of grandchildren feel at least two years younger than their age rising to years for men aged but her new findings have given her pause for thought contrary to our findings our new study found no youthful effect of the transition from not being a caregiver to becoming a grandchild caregiver for either grandfathers or grandmothers she said the new study was welcomed by prof cecilia tomassini a leading member of the grandparenting in europe network of researchers this research adds important insight to a question that hasnt previously been interrogated by going back to the same people she said even studies that have gone back to the same group have tended to lose sight of grandparents in ill health because theyve dropped out of the research this means those papers have ended up by only looking at healthy grandparents which is why theyve been getting until now largely positive responses bordone now believes that attributing a causal effect between childcare provision and feeling younger is wrong instead she said the link is likely to have more to do with hidden selection effects it may well be that personality traits and family values that mean grandparents already have a young subjective age are overrepresented among individuals who provide care to others she said in short rather than childcare making grandparents feel young its the grandparents who feel young already who do more childcare when bordone researched this issue in she asked adults who care for their grandchildren how young and healthy they felt this time she questioned the same adults aged before they began childcare returning over a period of time during which started providing childcare she asked the same question those who never provided childcare remained in the control group if your childrens grandparents are now reluctant to step up this halfterm you might have more luck asking a friend or neighbour of grandparent age the research threw up the unexpected finding that there are slight benefits in older adults looking after young children who are not their own kin the hypothesis said bordone is that unrelated children bring with them the rejuvenating effect of youth without the same reminder of old age that grandchildren do grandparenthood is a powerful reminder of a persons ageing and as such it is likely to affect subjective age she said,2022-02,grandparent planning hefty amount childcare halfterm might want think research claimed disprove previous finding rejuvenating

for the first time in a long time ive been reading my own columns from the start the impetus came when a friend reached out to say hed started doing so on account of his imminent fatherhood going over the early articles might he said give him a sense of things to come i was cheered by this because i am extremely vain but also slightly embarrassed since hed worked out to do this before i had now that i face the prospect of another baby and a startling lack of memory about how it should be cared for i simply cant remember much about the early days of fatherhood because i wrote about the experiences of rearing an actual baby while i was rearing an actual baby its a time in ones life where memory undergoes a dark age stress sleep deprivation and the constant buffeting of immediate shortterm goals means there are entire months that might only be retrieved from my brain via hypnosis this time four years ago on the other hand id been reading books buying a small arsenal of clothes accessories and equipment cleaning and recleaning our house until it squeaked and gleamed like one of those crime labs you see in films this time out i havent bought a single new piece of clothing would sooner resit my maths gcse than read another book about parenting and the combination of two years spent with both of us working from home and the grubby ambulations of our threeandahalf year old son have precluded our house from being any more hygienic than one of those crime scenes you see in films we do of course have some reason to be less worried weve done it once before and grubbiness and tantrums aside hes mostly turned out all right he was also the last baby to be born on either side of the family for a couple of years and this inherited an unprecedented jackpot in handmedowns so our ceiling now bulges with baby toys gadgets and clothes but the day and daily of childrearing feels distant and hard to conjure so here i sit wading back through old columns to see if they can stand me in better stead only to be found wanting not by the words themselves of course even i am rendered powerless by my trademark mix of gentle humour and wry observation no by the fact that i failed to create a stepbystep guide to baby care and chronicled instead my boring old thoughts and feelings about the ordeal overall im stunned by the hubris of watching a guy week by week learning how little he knows but always without realising that the frontiers of his ignorance will be stretched back further still by the following week to some extent perhaps its cheering to watch

happy mothering sunday an expression so cloyingly edwardian a tinted daguerreotype of an angel in the house caressing the rosy cheek of a sturdy sort in frilly bloomers it makes my teeth ache if you celebrate that is if not i get it my mums dead and i know it can feel like a sharp poke to an already bruised heart its nice that brands now ask if youd like to opt out of their off labiaplasty for mum on her special day messages enter willthisdo at checkout but it feels like just another round of emails to wade through as with most mothers day gifts i suppose its the thought that counts it doesnt feel like the cheeriest time to be in the reproduction game a maternity hospital bombed and a mother and baby killed missouri making a murderous attempt to criminalise terminating ectopic pregnancies because apparently theyre only pro unborn lives including nonviable ones even in the bestcase scenario you may be struggling to calm your kids fear of nuclear annihilation or climate collapse when the same things wake you nightly but we take our small joys where we can especially now and years of mothers days have provided me with a few even perhaps especially when it goes wrong i get a perverse pleasure from the ones where everyone forgets or i get a card pinched from my own carefully curated collection some weird part of me quite likes the chance to hone my martyred expression thank goodness because families being what they are theres more chance of pearshaped than champagne brunch heres my timeline of suboptimal yet strangely perfect mothers days happy what with a new baby after a few snatched hours ha seconds of sleep you wake in bleary milky confusion to a text perhaps from a relative but more likely from uber eats wishing you a happy mothers day is this who you are now and if so shouldnt something well nice happen it wont the baby is a dictatorial blob with no access to interflora your partner if you have one will do nothing because no one can instantly assimilate this new totally alien responsibility along with all the other new and alien responsibilities of having a baby your reaction will depend on what hormones are raging through your ravaged carcass anything from meh to medea toddlers respect nothing your child a raging ball of id has absolutely no interest in wishing you a happy anything at this time just settle down and watch your am hey duggee while being hit over the head with a wooden spoon this is your life now special breakfast you can hear the precarious wobble of the tray but what does it hold cheerios mixed with a handful of fishtank gravel a pint of undiluted squash pawed slices of cold toast smeared with a proprietary blend of marmite and chocolate spread if your child gives you something they like themselves suggest sharing ive spared my pancreas mountains of lucky charms with this ruse if not enjoy starting your special day with legostudded crumpets a raw potato or glitter putty craft if it can be fashioned from a dairylea box and glue stick expect to see it on your breakfast tray during the primary school years for me this was the laminator dark fate era my sons school obviously had one and churned out identikit bookmarks every year with an efficiency that would put moonpig to shame set your features to thrilled and dont get glitter in the bed it is an unforgiving exfoliant teenager

get a lecture about phallocentric capitalism or a fistful of flowers of dubious origin forgetful youths in my home town traditionally rely on the daffodils lining the city walls or nothing because no one is up or in one year following a fairly harrowing stretch of parenting we celebrated in a pizzeria in the company of our silent younger son and the internet router because his brother refused to come and er consequences or something i forget but i know i enjoyed offering the router a slice of quattro stagioni adulthood i guess thats over said my husband hesitantly but with real hope as we

the crisis in the uk childcare sector has been laid bare by two major surveys with campaigners saying young families and struggling providers are being ignored by ministers as the cost of living crisis spirals both surveys suggest childcare fees are increasing to an unmanageable level with twothirds of parents reporting rising childcare costs in the past six months and a similar percentage of providers confirming increases twothirds of respondents to the survey published by the campaign groups pregnant then screwed and mumsnet said they were paying as much or more for their childcare than for their rent or mortgage almost half of working mothers were considering leaving their jobs and were working fewer hours than they wanted to because childcare fees were unaffordable a separate survey of childcare providers by the early years alliance found of providers said government funding for twoyearolds did not cover costs while said funding for three to fouryearolds was insufficient only of local authorities report there are sufficient places available for children under two pressure has been mounting on the government to address the crippling costs a petition calling for an independent review of funding and affordability gathered signatures and triggered a debate in parliament but on international womens day signatories were told the government had no plans to carry out a review the parent survey provides further evidence of the cost of living crisis low earners are being hit the hardest with of households with an income of less than saying bills had doubled compared with of those with a household income of more than one in four parents said they have had to cut down on necessities such as food heating or clothing to afford childcare a figure that increases to of young parents and of single parents among childcare providers reported increases in electricity and gas bills while just less than a third were operating at a loss and said they expected to use financial reserves this year joeli brearley founder of pregnant then screwed accused the chancellor rishi sunak of ignoring the plight of young families after he did not mention the cost of childcare in his spring statement the government says they want to support hardworking families but families dont work without childcare she said it is beyond frustrating that childcare is being ignored time and time again the group is encouraging mothers to use the hashtag unhappymothersday to raise awareness among politicians of the difficulties working parents face in particular mothers the survey which was selfselecting found that of parents expected the cost of childcare to increase in the next six months with saying it was exacerbating the cost of living crisis and reporting high anxiety because of money worries the parents surveyed said they had reduced spending in other areas with cutting back on nonessentials while said they had resorted to using food banks rising to of black parents of young parents and of single parents in the childcare sector almost half of respondents said they were thinking about leaving threequarters had not had a pay increase in two years justine roberts ceo of mumsnet said the survey was further proof that childcare in the uk was broken for many families childcare is either expensive to the point of being unusable or unavailable at the times they need she said a government spokesperson said the early years of a childs life are the most crucial which is why we have invested more than bn in each of the last three years to deliver the free childcare offers including the hours per week for working parents we are also investing millions in family hubs where families can access important support services to support working families more widely we also recently announced the biggest ever increase in the national living wage since its introduction from april when romilly cole and her fiance calculated how much their childcare was going to cost while planning her return to work she could not believe it to have our daughter in childcare fulltime we were looking at a month which after tax was less than i was earning if you factor in another for afterschool club for my eldest it just didnt add up id be working fulltime and have nothing to pay the rest of the bills she said with a heavy heart she gave up her job at a local car dealership in the isle of wight where her brother also works and where her father too had been employed before his death i didnt want to stop working but it just made no sense for me to carry on its madness its just absolute madness she said cole now worries about the effect on her pension and her familys financial situation as the cost of living crisis bites as well as noting that the government has lost her tax revenue she added we have a lot of sleepless night but we try and be positive for the kids i know loads of friends who cant work for the same reason i just dont know how any normal

parents already feeling the squeeze from higher food and energy bills could soon be facing higher childcare costs as nurseries struggle to stay open amid their own surging energy bills and higher staff costs research by the national day nurseries association ndna found that of nurseries in england did not have enough funding to cover their basic costs after the impact of the covid pandemic on their incomes while said they would run at a loss or break even this year in april nursery finances will be squeezed even further by a rise in the national living wage a percentagepoint rise in national insurance and a sharp rise in the cost of heating and electricity bills more than childcare places were lost during the covid pandemic according to the ndna as nurseries closed between april and march separate data released by the early years alliance found a fall in registered childcare providers of in just five months between december and may government funding for help covering childcare costs for eligible two to fouryearolds will rise in april but at less than the rate of inflation according to providers it falls far below what is needed to keep nurseries running emma white is the owner of two private nurseries in suffolk small world kindergarten in ipswich and woodlands nursery in kersey mill near hadleigh she said she might have to raise fees in the coming months to cover increasing costs or face closure in the future while funding is going up by roughly a year across the two nurseries her annual wage bill is going up by from april most of our staff are on minimum wage or above and these payment increases are so well deserved they have worked all the way through covid what makes it difficult for us is that they are not being mirrored in the amount the government give us and they are expecting nurseries to take the hit personally when there is very little left to pay themselves and there are other costs to contend with we have to keep doors and windows open in the nursery for ventilation because of covid which means the heating has to be kept on she said within months our heating bill has gone up by a third and will go up again in april rising interest rates mean repayments on a loan to cover the nurserys loss of income during the pandemic have gone up from to in two months white recently had to cut a management role to help balance the books and while that will help to postpone putting up fees imminently it is still ultimately the only option more flexible working patterns for parents since covid mean that reduced nursery opening times may also have to be a consideration in the long run ultimately it will become unaffordable for parents to go back to work which means i will have even less private income coming back to the nursery and i wont be able to support an am to pm day she said what is going to happen next winter when income is lower if we cant make any money over the summer what will be left to carry the business on it is not just nursery owners who are feeling the pinch degreeholding early years practitioners such as kelly barclay are also struggling barclay works at the shotley bridge nursery school in derwentside county durham and is looking for a second job to relieve the financial strain she is facing due to the increase in the cost of living we are on the national living wage our bills are going up theres a lot of sickness among the staff and once my bills come out i am in my overdraft again she said people think we go to work and just play with the kids but we dont we are getting them ready to go to school teaching them respect and its incredibly important for the rest of their lives the living wage is not reflective of how important the job we do is we are worth a lot more im trying to get a cleaning job a couple of nights a week but im struggling to find something to fit with my hours currently i am paying for my gas and electricity which i think is unreal there is only me and my son at home i took a covid break on my rent so im paying back that so we are wrapping up warm and keeping the heating down i fear im never going to get out of my overdraft and have to keep paying the fees even when wages go up in april jonathan broadbery the director of policy at ndna said that nursery providers were very conscious of what a rise in nursery fees would mean not just for parents but for the development of the children in their care too every nursery works to the early years foundation stage and are providing educational opportunities and focusing on child development especially for disadvantaged children being in early education is one of the most important things you can do to close the gap lowerincome parents will be forced to withdraw their children who have the most to gain from not being a year behind their peers when they start school joeli brearley the chief executive and founder of the campaign pregnant then screwed said thousands of mothers were already struggling to get back to work because of childcare costs and availability of places and thousands more could be pushed into the red if fees rose with costs due to rise and even more childcare facilities set to close their doors we are heading for a crisis among families with young children she said the governments lack of investment in this sector is forcing parents mainly mothers out of work and into poverty dr maryann stephenson the director of the womens budget group said that single parents the majority of whom are women would be most affected by any further rises in childcare costs weve heard plenty in recent weeks about how to get parents off benefits and into work but very little about why that is so hard to do she added in its current form parents on universal credit need to come up with hundreds of pounds in childcare fees before theyve even gone out to work and earned a penny a really simple thing that the government could do right now would be to start paying the childcare element of universal credit upfront instead of in arrears neil leitch the chief executive of the early years alliance believes that parents and providers both deserve more we would urge the government to support early years settings to meet the rising cost of operating to ensure that settings remain financially viable and that vital early education and care remains affordable and accessible for the children and parents that need it he said a government spokesperson said the early years of a childs life are the most crucial which is why we have invested more than bn in each of the last three years to deliver the free childcare offers including the hours a week for working parents we are also investing millions in family hubs where families can access important support services to support working families more widely we also recently announced the biggest ever increase in the national living wage since its introduction from april and thanks to the action weve taken

two years ago i ended a friendship theres no right or wrong way to break up with a friend but a sensible thing might be to tell someone that they are no longer serving your needs and to quietly disentangle your life from theirs i didnt do this i swore at them over whatsapp and didnt respond to their messages ever again im not an advocate of the current fuck your friends mode of self care that posits you shouldnt feel a need to answer your phone accept invitations or listen to peoples problems if you dont feel like it i think friendship is about showing up even if you dont particularly feel like it but i also have a tendency to put up with some particularly bad friendships for much longer than is necessary and this was one of them i was strung out from making allowances and excuses for this friend and that day id reached my breaking point close friendships have their ups and downs hurt feelings neglect and friction occur because of the natural ebb and flow of our lives a bad friend is something else entirely an eyesore in our social landscape that for some reason we dare not dismantle i used to imagine that i was attracted to complex challenging or unsatisfying friendships because i have imagination and empathy i can see through defence mechanisms developed after difficult childhoods and i can understand what on first glance appears to be a horrible attitude for what it is poor self esteem this person is an overlooked puppy in a shelter and i am the one who will take them home no such thing as bad dogs i say stoically as the dog in question savages my hand and pisses on my furniture only bad owners instead of saying that something is unacceptable i simply put up with it for years hoping that with love and kindness it will all somehow magically resolve itself naive narcissistic unhinged one obvious outcome of the last couple of years has been that those habitual relationships have been interrupted and a break in order to reevaluate those we spend time with has been afforded us i look back at my social habits and see something glaringly obvious i have often formed friendships carelessly it appeals to me to act quickly based on an immediate mutual attraction i have crossed a room to tell a woman that we should be best friends after having had a single conversation with her i have gone on illadvised minibreaks that have ended in arguments and an empty bank account i have ruined several of my own birthday parties by inviting someone who has acted rudely and i have defended these people to the hilt afterwards theyre complicated theyre shy theyre depressed perhaps all of these things are true about the people in question but the main thing that they have in common is that i have decided to be their friend and that has historically been reason enough for me these sorts of friendships resemble romantic relationships theres a lot at stake emotionally theres an usagainsttheworld sort of feeling theres an excess of mutual affection and support bad friends tend to demand a lot of support something we are surprisingly willing to deliver if somebody does you a kindness it stands to reason that you would be moved to act kindly towards them in return whats known as the ben franklin effect is the complementary but somewhat surprising psychological theory that a person who has done a favour is more likely to see the recipient of that favour in a positive light to ask someone to do something for you is to state plainly that the two of you are on sufficiently intimate terms for this sort of request and to dare them to contradict you they wont people love intimacy they love to feel useful and needed and tightly bound to other human beings what better way to offer a person this feeling than to ask them to put themselves out for a moment for an hour for a weekend its a cruel irony that the fear of asking too much of people is more likely to push them away in some of the best examples of toxic friendship depicted in contemporary literature elena ferrantes neapolitan novels sally rooneys conversations with friends mary gaitskills two girls fat and thin the dynamic is fairly straightforward one introvert and one extrovert a hot mess and her bookish companion of course in reality these archetypes are stifling my bad friends have tended to reflect many of my worst qualities back at me as well as a few of my better ones perhaps it doesnt quite work artistically a bookish hot mess and her bookish hot mess friend surprise men can also make envious manipulative and mean friends too most importantly i have to acknowledge the fact that i am almost certainly somebody elses bad friend after all i have in the past forgotten birthdays not made an effort with my friends boring partners and continued talking about my own problems long after my companion has started to show visible signs of irritation maybe i no longer have the desire to either be a bad friend or to put up with one in my midthirties but more likely im just resting in between bad friends and the next one is waiting right around the corner frankly im excited to meet them eli goldstone is the author of strange heart

tens of thousands of women who asked the government to look into cripplingly expensive childcare costs in the uk had their demands for an inquiry rejected by the government on international womens day a petition calling for an independent review of childcare funding and affordability gathered signatures and triggered a debate on childcare in parliament but at am on international womens day those that had signed the petition were told the government had no plans to look into the cost and availability of childcare in an email from the petitions committee which published the governments response to its report on the ongoing impact of covid on new parents in september last year a survey shared with the guardian revealed that of more than working parents said ministers were not doing enough to support parents with the cost and availability of childcare while said childcare in the uk was too expensive the survey revealed lowincome parents and those on universal credit were resorting to using food banks as a result of the high cost of childcare the petitions committee stated that government response also fails to commit dedicated catchup funding to deal with the backlog in parental mental health and health visiting services and repeats the governments commitment originally given in its response to the committees first report on this issue to strengthening redundancy protections for new and expectant mothers but again fails to set a timetable for doing so the government said it had announced m in the autumn spending review for early years services including mental health services for new parents it added taxfree childcare is a great offer for working parents in its response to the committee the department for education said the need for a review had been debated twice and while the government recognised the need for ongoing collaboration and discussion on the issue it had been collectively concluded that a formal review is not needed joeli brearley the founder of pregnant

the question my partner broke up with me after being together throughout the pandemic and at the end part of her reasoning was that she felt she didnt really know who i am i recently started seeing someone new and although weve only known each other for a month she said the same thing unprompted truthfully i feel the same way about myself im and ive always felt subdued and unable to be expressive i dont know how to be authentically me how do i find myself i worry that i dont have the right things to say and that girlfriends will either be bored by or put off by what i share so i share as little as possible not always but it is my natural inclination i also shy away from conflict im not good at expressing myself and i think if i speak ill only make things worse philippas answer i wonder if you feel that if you are yourself you may put another person off but if we never take the risk of putting the other person off we never give ourselves the opportunity of letting ourselves be known to be known we have to be seen we will never be seen if we hide to truly connect with others we need to be not who we think we ought to be but who we really are you are worried about being boring in my experience in the psychotherapy room and outside it people are more likely to be boring when they are not taking the risk of being real in other words i want you to work on developing a tolerance for being vulnerable one of the ways to increase wisdom and connection is to speak in the moment and work out things in conversation rather than thinking we have to have everything right before we speak this means not filtering all your thoughts instead say i love you or try to articulate other scary selfrevelatory thoughts without knowing how they are going to land you can work out how you feel not always on your own in your head but in relationship with another say things spontaneously for the first time before youve thought them through practise being yourself and being unsure how youll be received dare to share is this a failsafe formula no it is a risk but without allowing ourselves to be really seen a potential partner wont be able to really connect with us so in my view its a risk worth taking in response to our earliest environment we develop coping strategies and these become ingrained habits what may have got you through early on may have even earned you the appellation of good boy might have been sharing as little as possible but what might have been a selfpreserving policy in the past can become a selfdefeating policy in the present you say not sharing is your natural inclination it could be just early adaptation therefore ingrained rather than natural adapting to other people is a skill and i suspect one you have in so much abundance that you might have lost some of yourself some people need to learn how to adapt and turn up the adaptation dial while others you seem to be among them need to turn it down if you adapt so completely to the other person there is nothing left of you for them to have a relationship with it is even hard for you to have a relationship with yourself i expect you are putting in more energy to work out the others feelings than giving yourself attention to figure out your own perhaps conflict is difficult for you because you have difficulty in knowing what you feel conflicts are usually far more about how we each feel than they are about facts there will be conflicts in any relationship as we all experience things differently its better if we can think of differences not so much as im right theyre wrong winning and losing but as an opportunity to gain understanding of the others view point and to communicate how you feel about yours then considering your and their feelings work together for compromise if conflict is completely avoided not talked about never aired a relationship can shrink because as subjects become taboo it means there will be less and less to talk about and areas of loneliness creep in where each of you remain unseen im wondering if you are numb where feelings are concerned you dont say how you feel about your breakup perhaps you learned to numb emotion because to have your feelings meant having pain trouble is we cannot just numb hurt and pain without numbing joy as well i think you need to work on turning up your feelings dial you dont have to go from zero to try turning to a two or a three to start with it will take practice your homework is to ask yourself several times a day perhaps every time you go through a door what am i feeling then from the answer work out what you want and then ask for it go for it its time for you to experiment recommended reading couch fiction a graphic novel about psychotherapy by er me about a man who had

as a young girl lauren burns told a friend that if they climbed high enough and jumped theyd be able to fly when their experiment failed her friend protested that it didnt work it didnt work this time burns corrected her burns has been questing at the forefront of flight ever since when she was her father drove her to essendon airport for her first flight two years later she made her first solo flight before she could drive a car she wanted to be an astronaut the first person on mars she was a star aeronautical engineering student at rmit when at her mother sat her down to break some news that would send her on another quest entirely into the inner space of her own cells and the missing genetic information they contained her mother told her shed been conceived via a donor the man she called dad whod trained her to be a star athlete and given her flying lessons was not her biological father utterly stunned burns could not process the news it had wounded me in a place i couldnt locate she writes in triple helix her memoir published this week stuck between a shattered old and undefined new reality daily life felt like watching a movie on a screen in the years since that moment burns has been fighting for the rights of donorconceived children while searching for her own biological truth along the way the aeronautical engineer gave up on mars but instead now lives on the south coast of victoria with her partner gerry and their monthold daughter working remotely for a swedish company intent on building the first electric aircraft writing her book has been instrumental to her quest for identity i wanted to go deep into the complexities why did i need to know who my father was this was the question i kept getting asked in all my advocacy i have a unique perspective on donor conception i wanted to flip the script from parent to donorconceived child she succeeds in triple helix burns writes her experience as a donorconceived person supplanting the old narrative from the parents point of view which ends happily ever after with the new parents holding their miracle baby that first generation of donorconceived babies are now adults and theyre speaking out calling for recognition and a childcentred paradigm following her mothers shock announcement burns was determined to discover the identity of her anonymous sperm donor she spent the next four years battling the medical legal and political establishments that kept him hidden in victoria had passed worldfirst legislation allowing donorconceived people to apply for information about their donors but the legislation only applied to children conceived after this excluded burns nevertheless she went searching for her biological father and she found herself up against an establishment of male doctors lawyers and politicians undaunted she conducted her investigation with the sleuthing skill of a crack detective and the protean talent of an actor switching from avenger to demure young woman depending on her opponent after four years she discovered that the key to her genetic inheritance was held by one man and his conscience david de kretser the new governor of victoria seeing de kretser on television had jolted her mothers memory she recognised him as her treating doctor for laurens conception it was her last shot burns appealed to de kretser to contact her donor father on her behalf fortunately for burns de kretser complied in august lauren received a letter from her biological father benedict manning clark youngest child of acclaimed historian manning clark and linguist dymphna clark it was a fascinating but not always easy experience she says like finding a mirror for many of my looks personality traits and interests triggering a paradoxical sense of connection and disconnection discovering the identity of her biological father was a great joy and a new emotional minefield her book gave her the space to explore this emotional terrain and the evolution of her journey who is the real father i wanted to crack the binary of biological and social father and show its a continuum burns had no words to express her radically isolating emotional tumult until she met narelle grech a donorconceived woman who became her mentor and ally my political advocacy began aged through my experiences dealing with so many old white men it was hard to connect with them and activate their empathy why were architects of this system all men i felt a huge sense of powerlessness and burning inner rage why is it this way until someone can describe it in words it was hard to know why i was so angry questions i didnt even dare to ask myself narelle put words to grech introduced burns to tangledwebs an advocacy group for donorconceived people and burns joined the battle to overturn the law that withheld donor information from donorconceived people born before like grech and herself her fight was fuelled by grechs death in from geneticallyinherited bowel cancer just six weeks after meeting her biological father who carried the recessive gene in the victorian parliament finally passed legislation to allow all donorconceived people access to information about their donor parents they called it narelles law exhausted after her arduous year battle lauren took a holiday with gerry in kakadu they knew something had to give when she climbed a plateau and screamed fuck into the void i swore a torrent of rage into the abyss it was very cathartic she laughs down the phone they decided to leave their jobs and travel around the united states in a campervan for nine months that time enabled me to process and digest in order to write the book it allowed me to build my awareness slow down and become really aware of the moment and it reawakened my love of writing which had been dormant for years burns weaves this trip into her memoir inspired by zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance which mixed heavy investigative sections with meditative and contemplative sections the rivers canyons and mountains they traverse provide rich material for her to evoke the absences and complexities of her experience the landscape thrummed with strange new possibilities as the canyons branched in fractal patterns like the structure of some giant brain the architect of this immense splendour was the humble raindrop and i was struck by the irony that the desert is most shaped by the thing it lacks water much of my life had been shaped by what was missing from it too despite the triple of the title the book is divided into four circles to evoke a spiral including the dna double helix the spiral is a symbol that endlessly spins around itself reflecting the infinite journey in donor conception its never over its a dynamic process the books called triple helix but there are four circles its deliberate to show that things dont quite fit my life is like dancing to two songs simultaneously it doesnt quite fit she says but there are moments of transcendence despite all the obstacles i faced how do you transcend your limited circumstances these are existential questions that everyone faces who am i what do i do with my limited time a question really brought into focus by narelle in burns was called back to the frontline of advocacy and is now a director of donor conceived australia dca a new peerled national body advocating for a childcentred system shes now focused on the bigger picture the socioeconomic structures that drive demand for donor gametes and surrogates in the first place she also wants to continue with her writing a big moment for her was recasting herself and her identity in relation to her biological father and the realisation she came from a family of writers that moment when i visited my aunt katerina in connecticut and was looking for a book i saw shelves full of clark literary output it gave me confidence that writing was something to do it was a weird moment of life imitating art

parenting a young adult child and manoeuvring the latest version of the dependenceindependence pushpull paradigm is hard enough but during a pandemic its even harder its the toughest parenting ive ever had to perform and thats saying something i was a firsttime mother at too scared to leave hospital after my sons birth and who when his father left a few months later descended into a sort of parenting paralysis for over a year then i started to write about my son and me writing helped but it was my mothers parenting me and her grandparenting my son that helped the most my son left home in a blur a week after getting his year results in in a nifty inversion of the pandemicfuelled relocation from city to country phenomenon he fled to the city from our country town two hours away its a cliche but it was a shock to me and to him i knew about empty nest syndrome not a clinical diagnosis apparently but a syndrome in which parents experience feelings of sadness and loss when a child leaves home but my childs departure hit me for a six the mayo clinic adds that you might also worry about your childrens safety and whether theyll be able to take care of themselves mum stop calling and texting me all the time its stressing me out stressing him out hes only ever in touch when theres a crisis and those can range from is that black hoodie still at your house your house that hurts to do i have ambulance cover i wake up most mornings awash in images of my son in strife that run like a whirring spooling super film in my minds eye all day i find excuses to contact him knowing that mostly hell either ignore these texts ones thinly disguised as practical questions but requiring immediate action or respond monosyllabically like an exboyfriend for years the abc radio national audience listened to my son grow up from toddler to teenager via autobiographical monologues i presented for life matters but then he asked me not to write about him any more because it was sooo embarrassing and so i stopped after my sister died i wrote a few pieces of grieffuelled manicmemoir but stopped that too now my son has given me permission to write about him again when i say permission i dont care weve got different surnames anyway do i have any black trousers at your place my son deferred his place at uni last year he and so many other gen zs have since spent another year in and out of lockdown and hospitality work living in share houses siegesurviving on everything from uber eats to drugs delivered straight to your door thanks very much via encrypted text messaging he has just moved into his third share house in months i help him pack up one place and we borrow the van and move him into his next joint on a wing and a prayer and a swift scrub of the latest kitchen sink and does he need another mattress a diningcumcoffee table does he even sleep or dine let alone drink coffee my yearold mother has spent the pandemic at home with my late sisters yearold son remote learning hah she has reared my nephew since he was a baby she is holding on to her grandson to her own life to me to my son for grim death once you lose a child nothing is ever as bad but everything is worth holding on to i lost my casual academic job at university at the top of the pandemic and now wrestle with a phd what for who cares as if and a newish relationship i never thought id do romantic love again who would have thought he and i started just before lockdown no and he became my intimate partner before we were even that intimate i just wish i wasnt so preoccupied with my son all the time we used to talk my son and i id tell him stories at night well into his teens wed go for walks and hed disclose all sorts of things sometimes hed even hold my hand today i watch him lurch from day to day from child to adult and i watch him fall over once very badly he nearly died i nearly died watching him nearly die his body is six foot three long and slim and sporting a tattoo of something he tells me i would not understand his face is beautiful these days his eyes show me little he has a goatee thing going on and his hair is kurt cobain when i was his age on the cusp of i was in and out of love i was living in and out of home i was dropping in and out of university i worked as a waitress was always broke and every shift at every cafe was an open letter to the me too movement i dreamed of becoming a famous actor zoomers like my son have had it uniquely tough during this pandemicstyle precariousness what are my sons dreams i wonder uni starts when what

western society has enthusiastically shaken off lots of the old restrictive taboos that once policed behaviour in fact today the very idea of being normal has been exposed as a bit of a sham when it comes to sexuality brain type or even life goals but there is one area where the pressure to conform is still woven through our expectations and conversations as well as through the marketing images that surround us all the ideal of motherhood now the american filmmaker therese shechter is tackling what she believes is a pervasive bias in favour of women having babies her provocative new documentary my socalled selfish life has already been admired at festival screenings with ms magazine describing it as a striking and imaginative documentary which addresses an oftoverlooked facet of reproductive justice from may it will be streamed until may on showamptell a streaming platform for documentaries although shechter never disparages parenthood she knows it will ruffle feathers i dont relish making anyone angry but thats what happens when you have an opinion and this is important to talk about she says i am not evangelical in the least and im not negative about people who want children shechter describes herself as antipronatalism which means she is opposed to the defining templates imposed on women but not to the basic notion of raising a family its important to talk about this thorny question without pitting parent against nonparent shechter adds it is just that women should now be treated like adults who know what is going to be good for us at the moment we dont have full body autonomy theres interference coming from what society values from religious beliefs and from some bad science all of it says its our job to have babies shechter herself chose not to become a mother and from this perspective she interviews several women who feel the same from the crusading s feminist marcia drutdavis to shanthony exum who has opted to live with a group of friends rather than start a family as bbc radio prepares a new reading to celebrate bridget jones the fictional s singleton who had such entertaining neuroses the pressure on young women remains strong last summer the british writer emma johns book selfcontained came out to acclaim while the columnist nell frizzell author of s the panic years launches her debut novel square one this summer a comedy it focuses on the looming targets still set for women frizzell has also just made a radio documentary mother nature sons about how her concern about climate change has affected her own view on parenthood is it actually selfish to consider having children when the future of the environment is so troubling the whole guiltridden debate feeds directly into one of shechters main arguments there are so many ways women are called selfish or narcissistic usually for doing what they want to do she says the attempt to limit our choices is also a good way to control society women are often accused of putting themselves first when they dont want a baby yet then they are asked who will look after you when you are older as if that isnt a selfish concept some of the unconscious policing is done by what shechter calls concern trolling whereby women without children are offered sympathy whether they need it or not of course there are many women who want children and cannot have them i cant speak for them but i dont think it helps for society to keep saying that having a child is the single thing that makes people the most happy her film questions whether it can be coincidence that the idea of a ticking biological clock arrived just when women began to enter the workplace in the s any rejection of what shechter calls a phoney biological imperative was regarded as radical and dangerous drutdaviss belief that motherhood was not going to be for her led to being interviewed for the leading us tv news show minutes on mothers day in she was filmed telling her inlaws that she had decided not to have children in a broadcast that changed her life i never regret what i did because ive learned through challenges she says this weekend i wish i knew more about pronatalism and how editing can affect how i was perceived my then husband hardly was heard although he was very animated during the long interview he was edited out i was the mean bitch breaking inlaws hearts when he was equally in acceptance of the childfree lifestyle drutdavis recalls the show ending with the presenter apologising into the camera lens pardon our perverseness in airing this on mothers day in her book john faces down the same insistent call to duty and the fear of an internal ticking clock i thought id got through my s and s without too much worry about being single or motherhood but then i realised i had always thought of myself as just premarried she says in my s there were a lot of internal narratives i suddenly had to deal with marriage and having children are the markers of adulthood if you step off this conveyor belt does that mean you are infantile are you irresponsible because you are not taking care of anyone else but then came an eyeopening experience for john in lockdown as she cared for her parents during her mothers final illness my sister was nine months pregnant with her second child and so a lot of it naturally fell to me this is in many ways a traditional role for an unmarried daughter but it also showed me a caring side to my nature and i realised i was not so selfish john points out that even today women are regularly celebrated only as wives or as mothers and shechters film also looks at this pernicious side of the traditional ways that women are validated her own mother who appears in the film does not approve of mothers day it is revealed because it raises one woman above another my mother is a selfeffacing person and she grew up in europe where the tradition was not such a big thing says shechter who is based in new york but she also rightly feels it is a problematic day for lots of people for many reasons the dressing up of motherhood in ribbons and bows for shechter is tantamount to coercion fertile women she argues are placed on a pedestal by society as a way of duping them into accepting the difficult and limiting world of childbearing it is akin as the pioneering american psychologist leta hollingworth set out more than a century ago to the way that men are prepared for war in her brilliant essay hollingworth showed there was also the same emphasis on service and sacrifice in compelling someone to enlist for something that was likely to lead to the loss of their life since childbirth was the biggest killer of women at the time what then lies ahead today for a woman who does not stake her security in old age on creating a new family for exum one of shechters powerful screen interviewees the prospect of growing old among friends is a more reliable one the assumption that a childparent relationship will be perfect or easy is false she says in explanation of her choice to live a childless domestic life with friends like any relationship it takes work to truly understand the other person and patience and openness to communicate and truly listen i know some people who have fabulous relationships with their parents and children while some have more fraught ones nothing is guaranteed so i feel the assumption is the dangerous part my so called selfish life watchshowandtell made by trixie films is the third in a trilogy of documentaries by shechter each intended to dismantle common

using childcare and many are cutting their hours research from pregnant then screwed shows of women spending more on childcare than on their rent or mortgage this is loselose all round m women are unable to work as long as they want to according to the womens budget group because they cant afford astronomical childcare costs the greatest loss is to children themselves who may never catch up with more affluent kids who get more and better nursery education genuinely free nursery places with no hidden topups are hardest to find in poorest places the bizarre government subsidy system gives more help to higherearning than lowerearning households now the government proposes that instead of more trained early years workers very young children can have fewer just one care worker looking

chances staff are now leaving the sector for other industries many are exhausted and feel undervalued with nursery places lost in five years says neil leitch of the early years alliance leitch believes that cuts in the stafftochild ratio would only cause more early years workers to quit whats more not a penny of the socalled savings made from this measure will ever be passed on to parents he says nurseries will pay off debts and pay their staff a bit more to stop them leaving it took two and a half years and a freedom of information request for the early years alliance to force the government to publish its official report showing that the ministers knew they were underfunding the sector by bn making it completely impossible for nurseries to provide the amount of free childcare

my friend stella margaret heath doesnt suffer fools gladly its what shes known for and she wont mind my saying so when i first met her in the s we were new undergraduates i picked her to pair with for a philosophy assignment because she looked easygoing and enlightened perm jeans thin white belt it turned out she was neither i discovered straight away that shed read none of the summer reading list and therefore cogito ergo sum meant nothing to her and only wanted to talk about timetabling restrictions at the polytechnic we became good friends best friends me not minding her cynicism and untidiness her ignoring my joie de vivre and shoplifting over the years ive watched her become a brilliant principled human being and less and less tolerant of other human beings i noticed just how much one rainy christmas in the s when trapped at my house with husbands and babies my motherinlaw approached her with a paper wallet would you like to see my holiday snaps dear she said no thank you said stella firmly without looking up from her anthony trollope i was astonished were you allowed to decline an old ladys shots of baby dragonflies and a donkey sanctuary my motherinlaw clearly thought not and after the children were down for the night she made a second attempt did i show you these photographs she said emphatically again stella refused to look and so i had a third viewing to deflect any awkwardness later i asked stella couldnt you have just flicked through them for my sake no she said i hate other peoples pictures it has long seemed to me that the concept of female friendship has come to mean some kind of unerring endlessly supportive kinship or if not one of the friends will turn out to be some kind of psychopath this has not been my experience and it isnt for the two main characters in my new novel susan and norma sure the friendship gets a bit rocky in parts but i have always found it odd that in fiction siblings romantic partners parents even neighbours are allowed to behave monstrously but old girlfriends always have to be on their best behaviour its been interesting to see the reaction to my depiction of the two friends the competitiveness letdowns and the brutal honesty as well as the laughs and the boosting take my sister who while reading the manuscript texted me norma is horrible and when i replied viva ferrante she texted back poor susan my grasp of the true meaning of friendship began at the age of eight when my first comrade suddenly went to america for the entire summer holidays without warning and came back overconfident appearing at our door in the september in a baseball cap she told my mother a joke like some kind of man i had two other significant childhood friends one whose parents wouldnt allow her to come round because of my parents divorce and had a spiteful twin and another who called me stib of the dump even though id asked her not to after the first time which i admitted was funny i was already a big reader and it struck me hard that friends in real life never quite equalled the benign dependable types encountered in books like the saintly ann jills best friend from jills gymkhana who was forever defending jill against the posh kids with flashy horse equipment are these fictional friends unrealistic i wondered or were my real ones a particularly poor lot then as a teenager i read the country girls and thank god here was a funloving pal who was also a selfish bitch it felt good to have my rotten friends validated by edna obrien i have since enjoyed ef benson and elena ferrante whose female friends are pleasingly disagreeable and cutthroat recently in spite of obrien and co ive been questioning myself am i right to have hung on to the listless individuals i happened to sit near at college or work in the s and s who seemed like they might be useful ifwhen i needed someone to copresent a descartes seminar or to walk out to lunch with making friends was tricky preinternet one couldnt check out who else already liked them before committing we had very little to go on mainly their footwear and willingness to make tea it was a huge gamble and so as i say i have this little gang that ive known almost all my adult life though to be frank they dont mix well even among themselves and if we met for the first time today im not sure wed bond my correspondence habit and the fact that i cant face great change is i think why i have doggedly clung on however grim and untenable they have become maybe i should invite them to the friendship counselling my american pen pal recently mentioned a sort of couples therapy but for jaded old buddies who keep misreading intentions and bitching out on each other her words our therapist showed us where the rifts were my friend told me and gave us the tools we need to keep the friendship nice god how id love to watch her therapists zoom face as i reminisce about stella yelling at her son in front of my new cornish mum friends in the cafe at the eden project just chew it for gods sake she was keen to stroll in the mediterranean biome he had accidentally chosen a lamb dish and suddenly understood the connection between the baby animal and the bloody bone on his plate he was four id also bring up the time she went to a pottery painting event with a different friend and made matching mary queen of scots mugs and the heartbreak over her move from london to southport when she chose yet another friend and the friends husband to drive the rental van and the time she karatekicked my sevenyearold in the throat albeit a kneejerk reaction to his tapping her on the head with a cat toy and the day when waiting in the car while i bought pasties in greggs she told my children and hers the facts of life because one of them mentioned sex its not just stella theres also a friend ill call julie who used to allow her child to open a brand new bottle of ketchup at virtually every mealtime because he needed to and for the same reason let him dunk chips into my sons fried egg and had nuggets and chips delivered to year camp when all the others had baked beans ive stuck with these friends despite it all the source of my steadfastness can be found i think in early childhood and my instinct in any given situation to always do the exact opposite of my mother whod ditch her friends at the drop of a hat ive a detailed memory of her dumping her friends en masse without even knowing she was doing it she was freshly divorced and throwing a party to prove shed survived i remember on the day she read the guest list out loud lifelong friends cousins girls with whom shed shared a dorm at school women with whom shed simultaneously been boxed up for marriage then pregnant and pregnant again with whom shed had trips to the seaside spent christmas easter and bonfire night women whose mothers just wanted them to be happily married with children and slim this was her entire regiment oh god she said i literally cant fucking stand any of them and because she said it just to us her daughters both under and already in our party dresses i knew she wasnt joking it was too late to cancel and soon the caterer arrived a woman called madeline from up the road and set to work on a huge poached salmon with its head still on and assorted slaws my mother was squeamish about the eyes and gills so madeline played them down with curly parsley these were the days before the flatleaf variety and in so doing gave it a look of gilbert osullivan the s singersongwriter the party got going and the music went on early and loud my mother swallowed a pint of punch wiped her mouth with her hand and then thumbs in belt loops she danced guests watched between bites of russian salad as she jabbed at the smoky air with her elbows and sang slightly the wrong words the dance was as profound as it was eloquent im not the person you used to know it said im no longer interested in picnics by streams days out in chapel st leonards or vinaigrettes i want to take drugs with new friends rebels like me single or with a game husband madeline the caterer nodded her head to the beat as she hurriedly put the finishing touches to the puddings gutted pineapples with brandy cream and some kind of kibbled nut then pulling off her hairnet she joined my mother and they really went for it many of the party guests rang the next day to say what a lovely time theyd had but my mother couldnt come to the phone and wasnt available ever again except for funerals a man friend did manage to get through to my mother but only to complain about the caterer coming at him with a pitchfork for parking on her grass how do you know it was the caterer she asked she had a bunch of parsley in her hand he said did she indeed said my mother madeline masqueraded as single but we discovered later that she had a husband who stayed upstairs she also had triplets who had to share two pedal cars between the three of them to be blunt madeline wasnt that good a friend she was selfcentred according to my mother and when they chatted on the phone thered be the sound of one child crying while the other two thundered about in their cars one day when she couldnt stand it any more my mother said i cant believe you took that parsley home parsley said madeline after catering my party said my mother id paid for that the garnishes are never included spat madeline and just like that madeline was dropped a short period of loneliness and heavy drinking followed until she befriended married couple liza and peter grosvenor leading figures in the shakespeare drama club whom madeline had introduced her to and soon my mother was playing viola in twelfth night and never stopped boasting about her action creating all the plays momentum the grosvenors sometimes invited us to dinner at their home and we saw for ourselves just how sophisticated they were i cant tell you what liza looked like because she wore her hair in a long fringe that hid her eyes but peter looked like a cross between doctor who actor jon pertwee and political reformer william cobbett with a puff of greywhite hair calico shirt and cravat dinner was always some kind of meat and potatoes with salad to follow served on rudimentary wooden platters that theyd brought home from crete and we had to be reminded not to saw into them too deeply with our knives these plates are very modern commented my sister one evening modern said liza wooden plates are very ancient id noticed on a previous occasion that the plates werent to go in the washingup water with everything else but were wiped over gently with an oily cloth and though that was surely a clue as to their place in history my sister must have missed it and now she looked a complete idiot one evening over a carafe of california wine my mother asked liza how she knew madeline the caterer and discovered madeline had seen an advertisement for their secondhand baby equipment and had ended up taking the lot for her triplets and from that had inveigled her way into the drama club even though shed never heard of shakespeare said liza scandalised never heard of shakespeare said my mother shes a dropout explained liza she must have dropped out very young said my mother apparently so said an eavesdropping peter its so refreshing later liza drunkenly confided to my mother that she and peter were in a menageatrois with madeline and whispered details that i couldnt hear we stopped going round so much when my mother started a fling of her own with peter and preferred to see him at our house where shed ply him with drink and goad him about shakespeares modest stratford origins and raise doubts as to his authorship of certain works citing the earl of oxford and christopher marlowe as more likely

council bosses in england are sometimes having to pay sevenfigure sums annually in order to house a child with complex needs many local authorities currently have at least one child whose care costs a week or more with providers increasing their prices further in recent weeks and blaming the cost of living crisis here a care home manager explains how care can cost m a year when we meet with local authorities they ask us to give a breakdown of costs when they realise how we have to cost our services they start to understand the high costs are almost always for placements that are made in an emergency after a child has gone through other placements which have been bought on the cheap and havent been able to meet their needs the biggest scandal is that local authorities always try and use the cheapest placement first when childrens needs arent met thats what ends up costing the taxpayer a fortune how can it cost a week to look after one child let me explain imagine you own an empty threebedded childrens home it has a manager on k and three staff on k the company also has a responsible individual legal requirement administrator hr finance qa quality assurance referrals salaries attributed to the home are around k est a week now imagine that you are asked to accommodate a yearold child they must have three staff with them at all times this means you have to employ six extra staff there can be no other children in the home the child needs to move in three days the authority are desperate you want to help but the only way you can do so is by using agency staff you dont have six spare staff standing by two agency staff for a hour shift at an hour is going to cost a day thats a week youll charge the la local authority at cost and make no profit on this theres also property costs vehicle insurance training maintenance equipment adaptations resources food amp activities for child and staff theres regulation monitoring you also have to factor in risks of unknown costs for all that you add another a week now lets say that the council say they only want the child to stay for days this is pretty common you dont take the risk of recruiting staff with no guarantee of the arrangement continuing this means you have to factor in the continued use of agency on top of all this you have to operate your business with an estimation that for some parts of the year the home will be empty there is never any guarantee of business so you have to include a payment for vacancies and while dealing with all this you are acutely aware that you are responsible for a high risk service if anything goes wrong despite your best efforts your entire business could be closed down in a heartbeat you will need to pay off debts and manage the risks and future there will be a very small number of providers who may take the mickey but hardly any as most of us are in this for the long haul and know the value of positive relationships with local authorities this contributor

the nhss biggest mental health trust has been accused of undermining its own workforces wellbeing by shutting its staff nursery despite it being a lifeline for them dozens of doctors nurses and other staff at the south london and maudsley slam trust in the capital face having to find alternative childcare because of its decision the loss of the nursery has provoked frustration and anger among staff they claim that the closure is adding to the stress levels being experienced by overstretched staff and makes a mockery of the trusts commitment to improving its personnels working lives the nursery is due to close its doors in summer next year as part of a massive redevelopment of the trusts site including the demolition of mapother house where it is based it and other old buildings are being demolished as part of a scheme to give the trust new treatment facilities that is being financed partly by the construction of new homes on its land staff and health unions have warned that the closure will deepen the trusts problems in recruiting and retaining enough staff to care for adults and children with serious mental health problems staff affected are worried that while the trust plans to include a nursery in the new buildings it will gain as a result of the redevelopment the replacement facility will not open until a trust official sought to allay staff concerns and said slam would provide a temporary nursery to cover the yearslong gap between its closure and the new facility opening a petition protesting against the closure of cedar house nursery gained more than signatures within days and scores of staff have signed a letter expressing their concern and dismay in a section headed staff stress and wellbeing the letter laments what it says is the trusts seeming dismissal of a valued service and its frontline workers it seems counterproductive to remove a facility which has such a direct consequence on staff wellbeing the nurserys workers are dedicated compassionate and highly skilled and the fact that it stayed open during the covid pandemic enabled slam staff to keep working when other nurseries shut it adds the nursery stays open for unusually

the long list of cuts made to social security benefits in the years after the election were justified by one purpose to save money but one cut in particular was about much more than that the introduction of a twochild cap on benefits meant that anyone with a larger family would have to manage without the support of child tax credit or universal credit for a third or subsequent children quite simply we have been encouraging workingage people to have children and not work when we should be enabling workingage people to work and have children so its time we asked some serious questions about the signals we send out through the benefits system david cameron said of the policy in in other words the supposed generosity of the benefit system encouraged families on a low income to have more children knowing that they would receive financial support for each additional child claims that families were milking the system were common at the time and so when george osborne announced the limit in he said that the aim was to ensure that families in receipt of benefits faced the same financial choices about having children as those supporting themselves solely in work but our new research funded by nuffield and published today on the fifth anniversary of the introduction of the limit shows that this logic does not hold up the twochild limit hasnt discouraged poorer families from having children it has simply made families poorer using government birth records we investigated whether the twochild limit reduced fertility among families on benefits who already had two or more children compared with those who were not directly affected by the policy we found that the fertility impacts of the policy were remarkably small a reduction in annual births of just under a year less than of total births and a reduction in the fertility rates of those affected of about we had expected larger effects previous research showed that benefit increases during the s had substantial positive effects on fertility approximately three times larger than our estimates our research suggests that doing the reverse cutting benefits has a relatively small effect on fertility why lack of information is one reason qualitative research by our sister project benefit changes and larger families indicates that knowledge about the twochild limit among those affected by it is low half of participants were unaware of the policy before having their third child this is hardly surprising the benefits system is notoriously difficult to understand in the uk even for experts laura a mum of three from london didnt know about the twochild limit she called up the department for work and pensions after she gave birth and they told her she wouldnt receive any support for her baby i was just so shocked she said but another reason is more fundamental the decision to have a child is a deeply personal one and isnt explained by financial constraints alone typically peoples fertility preferences are relatively sticky if your preferred number of children is two you are unlikely to have a third child in order to receive more benefits the cost of raising a child vastly outweighs any potential gain in other words increasing financial support may enable parents to have the children they already want but decreasing it doesnt necessarily prevent them from following through on decisions they have already made this is particularly likely at a time of low fertility when as now on average people want more children than they have so the twochild limit appears to be failing on its own terms it isnt really reducing fertility in many ways thats a good thing attempting to curtail peoples fertility by punishing them for having more children is problematic for all sorts of ethical and economic reasons particularly given the fact that fertility rates are already well below the level needed to sustain the population but it is concerning from another crucial angle child poverty if you introduce a policy that cuts the benefits of lowincome families with children but doesnt make them less likely to have kids then as a simple matter of arithmetic and logic the result will be an increase in child poverty and thats precisely what is happening child poverty among larger families those with three or more children has been rising sharply since and in fact almost all of the recent rise in child poverty is explained by its growth among larger families our research suggests that the twochild limit will make things much worse already lowincome families with over million children are losing a week a child due to this policy we know that this is having dire consequences for children who despite the best efforts of their parents often feel the effects of reductions in income the evidence is clear income and poverty have a direct causal effect on childrens development educational attainment and health and not just in the short term but over the entire life course restricting childrens benefits at two children also has worrying implications for our society no other country in the world caps childrens benefits at the second child what are we saying about children who by biological accident are born third in a family every child needs supporting regardless of when they are born or how large their family is it is about time the government recognised

it was one of the conservatives most controversial cuts waging war on the uks benefit culture by restricting social security payments that supposedly enabled welfare scroungers to have large families they could illafford the twochild policy which limits benefits payments to the first two children born to the poorest households would proponents argued cut the welfare bill and bring feckless parents to heel by as one minister put it teaching them the reality that children cost money new research however indicates the behavioural change aspect of the policy has dismally failed since its introduction exactly five years ago today the fertility rate for third and subsequent children born to poorer families has barely fallen instead the main impact of the policy has been to become the biggest single driver of child poverty in the absence of a behavioural fertility response to the policy the main function of the twochild limit is to deprive families living on a low income of approximately a year this will inevitably lead to dramatic increases in child poverty among larger families said prof jonathan portes coauthor of the study analysis of birth records and household survey data for the study commissioned by the nuffield foundation found the policys introduction in led to a decline in births of third children of just a year fewer than of the total annual births in england and wales the study speculates as to why the policy has had so little behavioural impact unpublished research suggests over half of families were unaware of the policy before they were affected many large families orthodox jewish and muslim families are disproportionately affected may ignore it for religious reasons the research comes as fresh estimates suggest that million children in more than families in the uk are affected by the twochild policy aprils belowinflation benefits rise means affected families with three children face a further a year shortfall in benefits to cover the basic costs of raising them on top of the preexisting shortfall from with larger families facing an even bigger hole in their income sara ogilvie of child poverty action group cpag which produced the estimates said the twochild limit is a brutal policy that punishes children simply for having brothers and sisters it forces families to survive on less than they need and with soaring living costs the hardship and hunger these families face will only intensify over of children in families with more than two children will be in poverty by according to cpag removing the policy would immediately lift children out of poverty despite ministers feckless claimants rhetoric official figures show over half of families affected are working the twochild policy was the brainchild of the former chancellor george osborne who announced it in against a backdrop of rightwing media hysteria around large families benefits broods claimed to be having children primarily to exploit what was considered to be an overgenerous welfare system it immediately ran into problems after critics pointed out that women who gave birth to a third or subsequent child as a result of rape would be penalised under the policy exemptions were introduced for this and for instances of multiple births or where families had adopted children or had kinship care arrangements there is evidence the twochild policy has been a key factor in many womens decisions to have an abortion research has suggested it has had a devastating impact on family life even before the current cost of living crisis with households forced to cut back on food and heating it was recently savaged by tory former welfare reform minister lord freud who called it vicious and an excrescence and said it should be scrapped he claimed the policy was forced on a reluctant department for work and pensions dwp by the treasury as the price of introducing universal credit a dwp spokesperson said universal credit enables people to support themselves and their families while building towards financial independence through work and the latest figures show that there were fewer children in absolute poverty after housing costs compared to this policy means families on benefits are asked to make the same financial decisions as families supporting themselves solely through work including considering our comprehensive childcare offer for working parents and child benefit for all children this article was amended on and april to clarify the shortfall in benefits for families with three children it is a a year

we are just two weeks away from the birth of our daughter and my son is making sense of it through dinosaurs namely by playing with four triceratopses roughly equivalent to our own family unit a large one daddy a slightly smaller one mummy a quite small one him and then another very small triceratops which he calls baby he repeats the words we say to him or the baby to these dinosaurs and brings them with him everywhere he goes most especially for bathing i say bathing but our new house doesnt have a bath offering instead a freestanding shower that is extremely almost alarmingly large seriously ive been to folk gigs in smaller spaces and its fully enclosed glass door means several people could happily use it at once perhaps this was its intended purpose as a convivial solution to the pain and boredom of showering alone why submit to the drudgery of breaking off conversations just because youve started to smell the architect probably thought when you can invite your poker buddies in for a scrub with you while ive not yet mined its potential as a hospitality suite or renting it out as a gig space i have hosted one person there several times and quite against his will its size has made it logisitically easier for my son and i to fit together for his nowentirely euphemistically named bath times but sadly its comforts end there the first time we tried it he acted as if i was preparing him to be eaten horrified that the serene joys of rubber ducks and soapy bubbles had been replaced with the decidedly less comforting image of his large awkward naked father pointing a showerhead at him in a glass box the size of hampstead heath he ran to the far wall it took him a few minutes and cowered like one of those inmates being deloused at the beginning of the shawshank redemption itll just be a minute pet i assured him as i pelted him with lukewarm water i quickly realised the best way to get him to endure this process is to periodically give him control of the showerhead to allow him to spray me to his hearts content while i surreptitiously apply soap and shampoo to his oblivious body washing a toddler is basically like washing rice you want to keep doing it until the water sluicing down the plughole runs clear and not the odd yellowyorangey cordial of dirt muck and food that scientists me call toddler juice this done i cede control once more and he spends the last few minutes washing not me but his tiny nuclear family of ceratopsidae who have thus far watched all this unfold in silence he sprays their tiny plastic forms until they squeak itll

ministers are being warned against loosening the rules around the number of children nursery staff can care for after it was revealed that regulations are being examined as a way of cutting costs for parents expanding the number of children per staff member or relaxing other rules are being reviewed by childrens minister will quince who is undertaking an international comparison as part of attempts to tackle the cost of living crisis it comes amid evidence of spiralling childcare costs one recent survey found that some pay as much or more for their childcare as for their rent or mortgage while of working mothers said they were considering leaving their jobs because of high childcare fees however the authors of a governmentcommissioned study warned that dialling down regulations would make the childcare staffing crisis even worse lowpaid staff could leave with no guarantee that any savings would be passed on to families they said quince caused immediate concern among nursery providers when he revealed he was looking at the issue last week a study concluded that allowing more children per staff member would lead to a reduction in quality adding quality childcare is expensive but there is little evidence that high fees are a function of regulatory requirements however the converse is true that very lax regulatory regimes lead to poorquality provision eva lloyd professor of early childhood at the university of east london and a coauthor of the report said the reports findings were even more relevant today than they were then she said socalled ratio relaxation which would allow staff to care for more children might prove a disaster for the sector current staff recruitment problems already threatening quality are likely to be exacerbated by ratio relaxations she said more staff may leave having to work even harder for abominable rates of pay the recent growth of large private forprofit childcare groups has seen staff costs kept down while parental fees increased substantially professor helen penn her coauthor agreed that loosening the regulations would be a very bad idea the number of children a childminder or nursery worker can look after varies by the setting they work in their qualifications and the age of the children for nurseries one adult can care for four children aged two for children three and over where a staff member has the appropriate qualifications they can be responsible for children dr sara bonetti director of early years at the education policy institute warned that comparisons with other nations were potentially misleading its positive that the childrens minister wants to learn from successes abroad but we would caution against comparisons she said some european countries may have higher staffchild ratios but its important to note that their approaches to the early years can be very different with staff qualified to degree or masters level and with a wider team of support staff in place in settings that arent counted in ratios neil leitch chief executive of the early years alliance said ministers were returning to an idea rejected by government nine years ago after a fierce backlash relaxing ratios will do little to reduce childcare costs and will simply place increasing and unnecessary pressure on an exhausted workforce education ministers are well aware we have a recruitment and retention crisis never witnessed before so it beggars belief that they would wish to consider such a shortsighted approach whats more this completely ignores the interests of the child they are not a commodity in some financial calculation to balance the books the costs of childcare have been growing with experts suggesting they will rise significantly this year every business will see costs increase through increases in national insurance contributions and the minimum wage coming in said ellen broom managing director of the coram family and childcare charity i dont think the uk is an outlier on regulations actually we have quite lowqualified and lowpaid staff compared internationally ministers are also said to be looking at other ways to help with childcare costs nadhim zahawi the education secretary said recently that he was seeking to improve the cost choice and availability of childcare a government spokesperson said the early years of a childs life are the most crucial which is why we have invested more than bn in each of the last three years to deliver the free childcare offers including the hours per week for working parents which is supporting thousands of families we are also investing millions to transform services for parents carers babies and children including through family hubs where families can access important support services we continue to look for ways to improve the cost choice and availability of childcare and alongside this we have recently announced the biggest ever increase in the national living wage from april to support

my baby daughter is awake so thats something this is you see what parents and their kind friends refer to as being alert the faint praise that forms the bedrock of every newborn parents suffering id shes so alert we say for want of anything else she has many admirable qualities shes extremely cute certainly and well im sure other things will occur to me as i go on leave it with me but for now shes awake and not crying so were patting ourselves on the back since this is a rare and delightful occurrence her sleeping patterns are broadly reliable which is a blessing but require us to be holding her at all times which is not this means my wife goes to bed at pm and the baby sleeps on me while i watch schlocky movies and spoon light snacks into my face with one hand without moving for a few hours over the past six weeks ive come to enjoy this time we have together me lying stock still on the couch her quietly purring on my chest motionless save for the brief flinches caused by me wiping away crumbs which have like a test case in a book on perfect parenting fallen from my mouth and on to the top of her head this lasts until about am when she stirs and i bring her up for a change hand her to her mum for a feed and collapse into bed only to wake up at six with the toddler and start the process again having a very small baby is im afraid not very exciting actually doing it can be frustrating euphoric brainmelting or lifeaffirming however describing the process involved in keeping a small baby alive is irredeemably dull in this way its a lot like writing ive long since realised that when my wife or my friends ask me how the writing is going im required by law to say really well thanks because even the most gifted writer on earth lacks the requisite communicative nous to translate any part of the writing process into anecdotal usefulness any time ive tried ive received the pained glazed expression i recognise from the times ive made it myself when stuck beside a stranger on the bus intent on telling me about the operation theyve just had on their leg wow my friends say kindly so you cut the end paragraph entirely and moved the middle to the beginning fascinating i usually stop when they start fiddling in their handbags to keep themselves awake in case theyre scrambling to find a cyanide pill even the baby seems bored inch by inch her wakeful moments are increasing but since she cant yet smile or laugh her implacable expression takes on a note of grave watchful disdain it is wrong in polite society to admit how offputting this is so instead we laud her for it never mind that she watches us with the listless contempt of a distempered empress shes watching us and thats enough were watching her too looking for some flicker of joy some quiver of the mouth the beginnings of a smile and the validation we crave nothing yet but were lying in wait poised ready and more alert than weve ever been in our lives did ye hear mammy died by

there are children in the care of local authorities in england at the current rate of growth of a year the figure will be in a decade if removing more and more children from their families was producing good results in terms of preventing harm and setting them up for life that would be one thing the truth is that while there are positive experiences of care and inspirational stories of people who overcome tough beginnings to build successful lives far too many are repeatedly failed careexperienced people face some of the most severe disadvantages of any section of the population overrepresented among homeless people and in the criminal justice system they also suffer from worse health education and employment outcomes than almost any other group this is the moral and social case for reforming the childrens social care system the rising cost of which is also placing huge pressure on councils a review promised in the conservative partys manifesto and prepared over the past year by josh macalister makes no bones about the extent of the dysfunction or the role of the private sector in exacerbating it while local authorities have faced an evertightening squeeze on budgets over the past decade the private providers that control of the residential care market have been cashing in profit margins averaged in and the competition and markets authority believes that fostering is on a similar trajectory with a handful of providers increasingly dominant mr macalister is right to state that like state education looking after children should be organised not around a profit motive but an ethic of care the duty of councils as set out in the children act is to make such use of services available for children cared for by their own parents as appears reasonable children in care in other words should be treated like other children rather than nationalise existing childrens homes or cap their profits mr macalister wants councils to band together and squeeze them out by rebuilding their own services or if they prefer commissioning notforprofit ones of course this and other proposed improvements will cost money the review suggests a budget of bn over four years some of which could be raised from a windfall tax on providers given ministers reluctance to tax energy giants profits the chances of them doing this seem small but the review comes with a warning that unless they do something the situation and cost will spiral out of control to reduce demand the reviews key proposal is a new community support system called family help if early intervention were to be boosted it suggests children who would otherwise end up in care could live safely with their families also recommended is a new focus on kinship networks and payment of allowances other suggestions include the welcome one of shifting responsibility for youth offending from the ministry of justice to the department for education so far signs that the government will respond constructively are not good the education secretary nadhim zahawi said on monday that a full response would take months the report notes the strong connection between economic deprivation and child abuse and neglect the reality ministers cannot hide from is that to reduce the risks facing vulnerable families poverty needs to be reduced mr macalister is right to refer to the life chances of careexperienced people as a pressing issue of civil rights it is good that their views and voices are listened to more than in the past but while councils resources are stretched to breaking point and ministers refuse to raise

the nuclear family is ill suited to effective childrearing this should be news to no one yet when my mum said it having taken the baby from me so that i could finally shower off myriad effluences i felt it in my bones even though my husband has been at home on shared parental leave and has been doing all the cooking and laundry and half the feeding a luxury few can afford i calculate that each newborn needs at least three possibly four adults to bring things up to a level beyond just about coping and yet the situation if youre in a heterosexual pairing is that after two weeks most men go back to work and their partners are home alone with a baby in an endless cycle of feeding sleeping and defecating trying to time it so that they can actually exit the house and see another human being before the next circle of hell begins whats it like a friend asked me of motherhood its like a tornado crashing through the middle of your life i said so you wake up in oz and everythings in technicolour but also youve been crushed by a house thank heavens then for grandparents and if youre lucky enough to live close to them and they are willing to help you have won the childcare lottery the love one has for ones grandchildren is in some ways purer less complicated a grandmother recently told me and certainly less guiltridden at the root of it is the darwinian knowledge that you would step in if anything happened to the parents she said not so long ago women regularly did not make it through childbirth alive after all likewise anyone who brings you food in the early weeks takes on godlevel status where huntergatherers used to be instead theres a website called take them a meal which allows friends to coordinate the logistics fidelity to humanitys tribal mutually supportive origins may have been all but obliterated by the industrial revolution and the rise of capitalism but we do have online deliveries hence cheese platters sent by friends in brooklyn and somerset and fruit and champagne courtesy of my sisterinlaw in new zealand my aunt teresa meanwhile has been trekking over once a week with a full meal that she has prepared the first week that we came home from hospital with our preterm baby she brought us a full roast chicken dinner with lemon pudding for after complete with a little jam jars of gravy and cream respectively i could have cried i did cry so i understand why new parents mothers especially have confided in me that they have found themselves fantasising about communes and not in a sexual way thats what got us all in this mess in the first place our fragmented society makes childcare a lonely and expensive business especially when youve gravitated to a city i was born into a shared cooperative house containing eight adults two of whom were east german defectors sleeping on the living room floor my mother said it was great to have other adults to talk to for many days on maternity leave seem to stretch out endlessly and friends say it can feel like youve achieved little while your partner has been at work the book what mothers do especially when it looks like nothing is brilliant at taking such beliefs to task so many women spending so much time alone with their babies without family support could exacerbate postnatal depression though we live far from our extended families i have been bowled over by the love and kindness weve received such as my motherinlaw picking up lastminute sleepsuits that didnt swamp our premature baby my thoughts have turned to immigrant women some of whom have emailed me about their experiences trying to make it through without their family networks in some cultures it is the norm postpartum for the woman to take to her bed to feed the baby while a deluge of relatives descend to care for her ive also been thinking of the new parents who were robbed of contact with their families during the pandemic but who say they at least found solace in the cocoon they were able to form at home thanks to fathers working from home the proverb it takes a village to raise a child is often cited to new parents but in much of the west we seem to have turned our backs on childrearing as a collective endeavour it is instead the business of individuals who must shoulder the burden in their atomised units subject to the twin forces of extortionate childcare and pathetic paid paternityleave provision yet the traditional heterosexual nuclear family is on its way out among my friends are gay couples who have conceived thanks to surrogacy or ivf blended families coparents single parents and women in traditional marriages who are basically single parents and will continue to be so once they inevitably divorce their husbands perhaps its time to dismantle it even further or rather expand our understanding of it i have never wanted my village more and never have they felt so far away whats working seeing caroline walkers birth reflections paintings at londons fitzrovia chapel while pregnant felt like a religious experience so i loved her new exhibition lisa at the stephen friedman gallery in mayfair which documents her sisterinlaws early days as a new mother what isnt sleepsuits with poppers that dont match up sleepsuits with poppers up the back sleepsuits with no poppers sleepsuits with weird tie things they should make them with velcro so you can simply whip

ministers have been accused of cutting corners and endangering children after the government confirmed it would consult on cutting childcare staffing ratios so that one adult can look after five twoyearolds the education minister will quince announced that the government would consult on what he called mirroring the scottish model which allows a maximum of five twoyearolds instead of four in england to be cared for by one adult the plan which is part of the governments agenda to tackle the cost of living crisis prompted a furious response from nursery providers and opposition parties the liberal democrats education spokesperson munira wilson said boris johnsons new plan is not to address soaring childcare costs headon but instead to cut corners and endanger our children their safety should be our number one priority not be reduced to a costcutting measure neil leitch the chief executive of the early years alliance said the childcare sector was already on its knees with underpaid overworked staff the ignorance and shortsightedness that would lead anyone to suggest relaxing ratios as a solution to the problems our sector faces is frankly mindboggling he said the minister stressed that he had rejected more radical plans to deregulate the sector this proposal is about giving providers greater flexibility he said some were pushing me to go further on ratio reform but ive been clear from the start that i would not compromise on safety or quality he hinted at further changes in the future however saying this consultation is just the start of the journey we have some of the best early years provision in the world and ill continue exploring how we can be ambitious for working parents improving flexibility and reducing the cost of childcare with inflation expected to hit double digits in the autumn whitehall departments have been charged with coming up with ways to cut costs for households without directly spending taxpayers money childcare ratios will be

letterbox theres a flyer flogging perfumes because mums worth every scent i bin it and grit my teeth only another week of this and then the hardest day of the year will be behind me when youre childless not by choice mothers day can be a painful reminder of profound loss for some its miscarriage for others its infertility and then theres something called circumstances a term with a complex set of subcategories my story involves all three multiple miscarriages long periods of apparent infertility and then a relationship with someone who didnt want any more children although i gave up trying to become a mother almost two decades ago wrangling that grief is still a daily challenge im not alone there are dozens of online groups for those of us who are involuntarily childless people who sometimes feel isolated andor invisible as a result these forums are digital lifelines offering a sense of belonging a space to confide our vulnerabilities a place to find empathy for our shared heartache at this time of the year the posts are full of wrenchingly sad confessions about how much it hurts to not be a mother on mothers day im no grinch communal rituals of gratitude and appreciation are important even though my antimaterialist mum called mothers day commercial bullshit day i still gave her a present every year just as i would never advocate cancelling christmas

campaign trail are peppering their speeches with promises to help working families yes involuntarily childless people like me could unsubscribe from the promotional emails and try to avoid the

day of mourning formerly marginalised groups are inching towards the cultural mainstream as disability and cultural diversity are represented more authentically in marketing campaigns and some retailers are finally cottoning on to the inappropriateness of blanket sales campaigns a restaurant recently emailed me using the term celebrate your hero as an alternative to mothers day whether youre spoiling your mum aunty or someone else special the blurb read and i latched onto that word aunty like a lifebuoy when a retailer emailed to ask if i would like to opt out of any mothers day promotions i jumped at the chance but these offers are still the exception rather than the rule there is a lack of clear data on the numbers of involuntarily childless people in australia there is a lack of clear data on the numbers of involuntarily childless people in australia according to the abs approximately of couples dont have children and around of women are likely to remain childless government website health direct reports that in australian couples of reproductive age experience fertility problems but its hard to find any reliable statistics on how many australians who wanted to become parents have been unable to do so i cant argue for more sensitivity and visibility on the strength of our numbers what i can do is share with you the lived experience of this disenfranchised grief in the hope that my story might inspire empathy and understanding for others who are still grieving in childless a story of freedom and longing i describe my sevenyearlong quest to become a mother and how that failure impacted on every part of my emotional life and i describe all the ways in which ive tried to accentuate the positives in my situation but when mothers day comes around and women all over the country are being feted by their progeny no amount of positive psychology can override the sense of loss i feel an occasional acknowledgement that some of us cant share in this

ive never been happy with my looks and was often overlooked as a child and high school for the prettier girls which was very hurtful ive got a sevenmonthold baby brown hair and brown eyes quite chubby compared to other babies her age and when i see pictures of her with my friends with babies a similar age i feel worried that she will always be seen as the less than one in the group due to her looks the other babies in my friendship group have bigger eyes blond hair and blue eyes and my friends and extended family have made comments about her not taking after this side of the family ie by being blond and skinny or oh no she is going to have brown eyes i worry for her i know it sounds silly but the world is judged on looks and i dont want her to feel the same lessthan bodyshamed feelings that i did how do i go about making sure she doesnt feel lessthan or notasgoodas based on her looks eleanor says first lets start with the obvious a brownhaired browneyed chubby baby does not have lessthan looks not only is there nothing wrong with being big or darkhaired even if there was how someone looks at seven months is an indicator of almost nothing a womens hospital near me used to stick up polaroids of oddlooking babies to reassure new mothers that many infants look peculiar not rolypoly like your little one but really peculiar with a conical head or a heavily wrinkled brow or hair all over their body it was meant to give a chuckle as well as a reminder that kids change radically as they grow colouring reverses minuscule babies become big and round little sausage limbs turn lean and lanky it takes years to look like ourselves so for now everyones predictions about your daughter are baseless second you asked how to make sure she doesnt go through what you did the curse of parental love is that it comes with a dose of worry and naturally that worry rummages through our own life when it wants to know what to be vigilant about every parent wonders how to shield their child from the particular suffering they endured themselves the risk though is that vigilance can become selffulfilling bracing a child too much for a bad outcome can teach them to expect it or to see the world through its lens the challenge is to equip kids in case something bad lies ahead while letting them find out on their own if it does many children inherit their parents traumas around money betrayal love not because their parents hurt them but because theyre on such high alert that someone else will thats especially true when it comes to appearance kids dont come into the world with concepts like too heavy or too plain someone has to teach us what those things mean and that they might apply to us the hazard is that by explicitly telling your daughter theres nothing wrong with how she looks you raise the possibility that there may be fortunately time is on your side here its years before your daughter can think about this i think one of the most helpful things you could do in that time is try to heal your own experience with looks that wont be easy youve spent a lifetime being stifled by beauty expectations and it is hard confronting work to face them down but lots of girls learn beauty standards by hearing mum selfdeprecate in front of the mirror if you can love what you see instead or even just not think about it very much shell have an ally before the fight begins you cant control what she hears from other people but you can show her what it looks like to not mind and if you want to know what it would be like to see yourself as beautiful try looking through your daughters eyes to her youll be the most magical creature alive in the meantime you can bat relatives away with i know isnt she gorgeous or tell them its a parenting rule that we dont comment on peoples appearance good or bad these strategies might help deemphasise appearance as something she thinks about at least for a while sometimes the best way to spare a child the things we fear is to spare them the fear itself ask us a question do you have a conflict crossroads or dilemma you need help with eleanor gordonsmith will help you think through lifes questions and puzzles big and small

two weeks in were weary and bleary but at least our son is excited to have a little sister some of the time mostly hes about as excited to see a baby as everyone else is its just that hes more honest about it look babies are lovely and there is a certain thrill to meeting them for the first time even the first few times after that the point is made and the fervour subsides a little babies are adorable but they dont have much range fifteen minutes into being handed someone elses i might as well be holding a warm purring sandbag my son is excited when his little sister is awake on her mat moving her arms and legs about like a stranded turtle he thinks this is funny because well it is i mean just get up you stupid baby but by the time shes clasped his finger with her whole hand released it and turned her face inside out to begin crying again his arms are resolutely by his sides and hes off to play with his toys by himself and thats just when shes awake when shes asleep he acts as if were trying to excite him with a toy from which the batteries have been callously removed babies hes discovering sleep for hours a day and feed or cry during whats left the crying might be the biggest shock to his system he does not care for it and it would be nice if i could ascribe this disdain to concern but it is definitely contempt both for the noise itself for there are few more penetrating sounds on earth than a newborn in full fanfare and towards us for the false advertising hes beginning to deduce from this whole affair he was promised a miraculous adventure into brotherhood with a serene and toothsome living doll brought home just for him what he got was a smelly little smoke alarm made from bright pink meat who sleeps all day and hes not allowed to touch ill admit the cries have stunned us too even second time round were amazed by how rattling they are consider that even the smallest whimper of a newborn appears to presage high danger much like when a character from a period drama coughs once into a hanky and everyone knows theyll be dead by michaelmas whitsun or maundy thursday basically any of those days the english make up to sound fancy to americans as a result her cries her actual fullthroated blistering cries might as well be air raid sirens so if hes finding it hard to enjoy that part of newborn adjacency hes not alone perhaps then it was a surprise when he bounded into nursery on his first day back screaming about his little sister to all his friends they trundled quite charmingly towards him as if he was an old timey newsboy waving reports from the russian front in a public square she is small and loud i love her she is my little sister he says repeatedly as they flock to hear more all reservations cast aside he is a newborn evangelist maybe talking about babies is more pleasant than looking after them fulltime not that id know anything about that did ye hear mammy died by samas oreilly is out now little brown buy a copy from

a charity that champions the employment rights of pregnant women and new mothers has been dropped from a government advisory board after posting critical tweets in recent months senior tories including the culture secretary nadine dorries and her predecessor oliver dowden have taken pains to position themselves as champions of free speech decrying cancel culture so it came as a surprise to maternity action the charity said when it was removed from the group tasked with advising on workplace discrimination after its director aired her views on social media about the limited scope of the board and a lack of progress ros bragg tweeted we have an advisory board looking at nonlegislative improvements to reduce maternity discrimination which will meet quarterly until march no action plan no recommendations for legislative change after highlighting recommendations from the sector she added disappointing the charity told the observer that officials referred to the tweets when it was told it would be removed the department for business enterprise and industrial strategy beis has not denied the decision was based on braggs tweets heather wakefield chair of maternity action said we were surprised by our removal from the board the reasons for which have not been adequately explained to us beis officials were well aware of our criticism of the boards disappointingly narrow remit when they invited us to join last year in july ministers promised a taskforce to draw up an action plan on keeping pregnant women and new mothers in the workforce we are still waiting for that action plan labours shadow minister for the arts and civil society barbara keeley mp said rather than sidelining a charity because they dont like the chief executives tweets the conservatives should be laserfocused on tackling energy bills and the cost of living crisis it was confirmed in parliament on tuesday that the charity would not be invited to a second board meeting it was absent from a list of members presented by conservative mp paul scully other members include the fawcett society working families and pregnant then screwed whose founder joeli brearley said she would be raising the issue with beis at the next meeting this month a spokesperson from beis pointed to an earlier statement by scully which read the pregnancy and maternity discrimination advisory boards purpose is to consider nonlegislative improvements to reduce pregnancy and maternity discrimination in the workplace it is a collaboration between government employer and family representative groups and the

the peabody trust one of the uks oldest and best known housing associations has been accused of failing to rehouse tenants it plans to evict to make way for a new development their plight highlights an acute shortage of affordable homes for lowwage key workers amid concern that too much new building is being targeted at more lucrative markets the tenants in five households including children and three nhs nurses were all given what were supposed to be temporary housing on peabodys st johns hill estate in clapham southwest london which is being demolished and replaced their rents were discounted to reflect the poor conditions of the homes but are still more than twice the amount paid by their social housing neighbours three of the families have lived in damp and overcrowded conditions on the s estate for between seven and years as they are tenants on short lets peabody has no legal duty to rehouse them in social housing unlike their social housing neighbours who have been offered homes on the redeveloped estate one of the threatened tenants valeria jemwa a senior respiratory nurse and single mother with four children said i have been in my flat for years and they peabody are making me homeless they should feel a moral responsibility to help us even if they dont have a legal one she asked why am i being treated like a secondclass citizen why dont i deserve a replacement home on the new estate like the others it just feels that nobody really cares speaking to the guardian during a break from a shift at the royal brompton hospital jemwa said she and her children have been told to move out of their twobedroom flat by july i will wait until the bailiffs come to kick us out because we dont have anywhere else to go she said like the other four households also facing eviction two as soon as next week jemwa has been offered other homes by peabody but only on unaffordable rents and in areas several miles from her childrens schools despite qualifying for housing benefit and child tax credit she already struggles to pay her existing rent on her parttime salary rent of a month for one of the homes she was offered would leave jemwa with just from her net monthly salary peabody want to push me into somewhere they know i cant afford she said under peabodys own published policy applicants for its market rent homes must be able to afford the rent without further assistance jemwa and the other tenants are being advised by retired housing consultant tony bird who has written good practice guides on decanting tenants on estates earmarked for demolition and previously trained peabody staff on the issue he asked do peabody really want to evict such wonderful public servants the trusts chair sir bob kerslake the former head of the civil service has been repeatedly asked by bird to intervene but each time kerslake has referred the issue to their local council wandsworth which has nominations rights for all new social housing in the borough wandsworths new labour cabinet member for housing aydin dikerdem urged peabody to take responsibility for the families he said my priority is to work with peabody to find suitable accommodation for these families so they can live where they need to be for work and their children the housing allocation system has to be fair to the thousands of homeless families on our waiting list but housing associations are allowed to use their discretion to solve emergency issues some of these tenants have been in peabody accommodation for years and are precisely the kind of people in need that peabody was set up to house dikerdem said the redeveloped estate included too many small homes for shared ownership and market rent any regeneration that makes families like these homeless is not doing what it should be building market rate and shared ownership should not be made at the expense of homes for residents like these in a statement peabody said in an ideal world all keyworkers and people on low incomes would have access to social housing however the highest priority households on our internal rehousing lists include domestic abuse survivors people fleeing hate crime and people with severe medical disabilities we could not prioritise intermediate rent tenants ahead of people with the highest level of need to do so would be deeply unfair and a breach of our obligations to our social housing tenants we are using discretion by offering alternative affordable homes to families and residents who do not have social rented tenancies were also offering payments of almost as well as other support and advice they have all been offered homes that are significantly below market rent levels as close to the estate as possible well keep working with the council to try and find a solution that supports the families,2022-06,peabody trust one uk oldest best known housing association ha accused failing rehouse tenant plan evict make way new development plight highlight acute

as the speaker welcomes cats into the chamber last night his deputy criticised my parenting for bringing my toddler to the voting lobbies she demanded i hand her over to her instead despite being a stranger to my child such outward hostility towards making parliament family friendly does little to improve the perception that westminster is out of touch with those it seeks to serve when of the population think democracy doesnt work refusing to accept the status quo becomes even more important not just for equality but to protect democracy itself todays news that the procedure committee has decided parents accompanied by babies are forbidden in the house of commons in contrast to many other legislatures around the world and previous custom yet again reinforces the impression westminster isnt a stcentury workplace but a rarefied debating club for the elite this decision will not affect me both my children are now too old to sit quietly so i can speak but it speaks volumes about how determined some are to send the message that mothers are not welcome unless they pretend their children dont exist like many parents i have taken both my children into work not to prove a point but out of necessity the lack of adequate maternity or paternity cover for mps means the alternative was my constituents going unrepresented the report recognises that without such cover there is a risk the public will feel they cannot elect women despite promises almost a year on from the birth of my second child no work has been done on what a maternity policy might look like something that ironically we legislate to compel other workplaces to do some on the committee suggested such concerns are londoncentric as if bedtime for babies were set on a regional basis and the report failed to speak to anyone who isnt already in parliament about whether there were barriers to participation other mps shrug and say our job isnt normal so what do we expect as if that makes antiquated ways of working justified as we have seen with so much when westminster marks its own homework it often decides all is well to the horror of the british public outside in the real world women repeatedly report they are told their children will suffer if they become mps unlike their male counterparts campaign groups pregnant then screwed and the fawcett society are aghast at the impact this has on policymaking with childcare virtually ignored in the cost of living debate and maternity rights now under threat as part of the brexit legislation little wonder then that while more women have been elected in the last two decades most are either childless or have grownup children we should never stop fighting for everyone to be able to have both the career they want and a job that allows them to spend time with their children where and when they want so they are more than a photo on their desk the place that makes the laws on what rights parents have has a vital role to play in leading this debate rather than stifling it yet working in a place where some boast about never having changed a nappy and leave notes on the desks of those working from home accusing them of being lazy its embarrassing how backward parliament is compared with modern workplaces across the country flexible working isnt an indulgence as our economic competitors are showing us its critical to a more productive economy today shows that parliament will not change from within with elections only every few years our chance to secure that from outside cannot be missed thats why we set up the mothered fund to provide grants to mothers to stand for parliament and to send the message that the parents missing from our politics arent a problem to manage but potential talent we should seek out that those coming forward are so very different to those currently elected with a third being from black and ethnic minority backgrounds a fifth having children with special educational needs and a third single mothers reflects how its not parents who arent political but our body politic that isnt set up for parents this report may be a missed opportunity but the demand for modernity will only grow

mps should not be allowed to bring babies into the house of commons chamber during debates a crossparty review has recommended after mounting confusion about the rules the procedure committee report was ordered amid an outcry over labour backbencher stella creasy being told she could no longer bring her newborn son while making statements or asking questions in parliament the group ruled that mps should not bring babies into the chamber or nearby westminster hall if they wanted to observe initiate speak or intervene in proceedings but they said there should be a degree of defacto discretion that should be exercised sparingly creasy said this was not enough and railed at the antiquated rule remaining in place the committee did however back the extension of proxy voting for serious longterm illness the review into the rules was ordered by commons speaker lindsay hoyle in november after creasy was told she could no longer bring her son pip then three months old with her into the chamber the mother of two who represents walthamstow in london hoped the review would allow parenting and politics to mix creasy was shocked when the commons authorities emailed her rules prohibiting bringing children to debates after she took pip into westminster hall mps described the boy as as good as gold during the debate but the committees report said it was a longstanding practice underpinned by previous rulings that babies should not be present during debates and question times they noted there had been several occasions when mps had brought babies into debates without disruption but this had contributed to some confusion and a gap between the practice and the rules many mps were supportive of ms creasy with deputy prime minister dominic raab saying he had a lot of sympathy for her and that he would not be distracted by a baby but tory backbencher alicia kearns argued the chamber was no place for a baby creasy said that she was not surprised by the recommendation because the committee didnt speak to a single person outside parliament despite many of us encouraging them to do so they dont recognise who is put off parliament by its antiquated rules and approach to women who have children and the need to modernise she added they are not alone in working like this in the last year weve seen no progress on parliament having any form of adequate maternity or paternity policy in place and no progress from ipsa the independent parliamentary standards authority on providing proper maternity or paternity funding either change will only come when we start listening to those outside the status quo,2022-06,mp allowed bring baby house common chamber debate crossparty review ha recommended mounting confusion rule procedure committee

with her care covid generalised mum guilt nevertheless since the start of the year she goes there monday to friday from am to pm and its free except for the a we pay every month that covers food and occasional extras like an icecream on a hot day in a nursery group of seven along with two carers they go to playgrounds gymnastics theatre performances and community gardens lunch is catered every day and when its delivered im told my daughter yells essen food and runs to the door in her little felt hausschuhe slippers it all sounds rather cute but of course utopia its not like many other countries early childhood educators are often lowincome earners and many centres are understaffed often chronically so in theory however since every child over the age of one in berlin is entitled to subsidised care in the public system until they reach school age the trouble is its not easy to find a kita spot i contacted more than when we started our search last year and received positive responses from just three and harder still to find a multilingual centre many have a yearslong waiting list and arent located in our neighbourhood the discovery of all this shed some light on why so many people asked us if wed started looking for a kita when my daughter was still in utero despite a standard to month elternzeit parental leave in the end it is often a matter of what you can find rather than what you might want for your child a pedagogy if there is one you align with for example diversity within the centre and certain dietary preferences ultimately we went with the first kita that offered us a spot and while the group isnt as diverse as we were led to believe and the lunch menu features beef gyros or a german version of rissoles every tuesday even though we were told the children ate a vegetarian menu we are generally happy as is my daughter as long as we get her there on time we dont dare to be late but i do have to squint my eyes to the small changes ive seen in my daughter since starting kita she wont wear sandals without socks now cliche but in our experience true doesnt like to get dirty and hates getting her clothes wet so much so that it took two weeks of gentle coaxing before she would get her swimsuit wet at the beach her favourite german song is about not putting your elbows on the table when youre eating it all makes me wonder how much behavioural ironing out is necessary at such a young age when i pick her up my daughter is happy to see me somehow relieved but she is also often reluctant to leave an additional insult to the fact that she does for her carer many of the things that she wont do for me including sit in the pram clean her teeth brush her long mane of hair one day i commented on how nice her hair looked and her carer replied quite matteroffactly yes we brush it as though it had never occurred to me to do the same i tried to explain that i hadnt been able to brush her hair in months but the staff are mostly uninterested in talking to me and often dont acknowledge me at all when i am there no hello no chitchat about how the day went mostly it doesnt matter the important things somehow get said but it often makes me feel like a child myself like the time one of the carers asked me if i had read the latest email about testing for covid when i said that i had she hinged forward slightly at the hip and speaking loudly and clearly through her mask said und hast du es verstanden and did you understand while i dont connect with my daughters carers and there are things that i might do differently myself i do trust them with her care and i can see that my daughter feels bonded with them in community even if i dont if we were to return to australia as i hope that we one day do the money i earn working parttime as a freelancer would not make this level of care financially viable and so despite my initial hesitations perpetuated perhaps by how insular life has been the last two years i realise now how incredibly lucky we are in berlin to have universal childcare available to us not only am i able to work without the financial burden of childcare hanging over me i am also able to take time out for myself if i need it hopefully the early childhood education reforms announced by the new south wales and victorian governments last week might mean that more australian parents but especially mothers are afforded

i racked my brains trying to work out what to get my husband for his first fathers day a fartthemed mug and a book of dad jokes dont really cut it after all the weeks and weeks of handson fathering and i mean proper fathering the fathers day gift economy themed as it is around activities that you do away from your children golf and drinking whisky hasnt really caught up with modern dadding in two weeks my husband goes back to fulltime work after nearly four months of shared parental leave and i will become a fulltime parent in this country most dads go back after the measly two weeks of statutory paternity leave so our experience is not typical the culture enables this my husband has been told socially that there is not much point taking this time that he wont be able to interact with the baby who will only be interested in his mother and will just be changing nappies no one mentioned bonding he has been there in every sense he was there in the neonatal intensive care unit with his shirt off holding the baby against the beat of his heart so that the boy knew from his first hours on this earth that he was loved and protected he fed me when i was struggling to feed the child and sat in on more breastfeeding consultations than anyone should have to he fed the baby too from bottles right from the beginning which had not been our plan but which has only enhanced their closeness and liberated me hes done the night feeds and the rocking to sleep and the postjab calpol they bowl around the neighbourhood together the baby strapped to his chest in a way that piers morgan would hate he can make our child smile with the widest purest grin ive ever seen and yes hes had a fair bit of baby shit up his arm too all dads should have this i think if they want it it shouldnt be such an immense privilege to get to bond with your child in her book the life of dad the making of a modern father dr anna machin says that bonding between father and infant is a twostage process the first stage happens at birth is underpinned by oxytocin and relies upon the biological connection between father and child provided by genetic relatedness the second stage comes much later because it is based upon conjoined lives and interactions and is promoted by the much more powerful bonding chemical betaendorphin leading to a more profound and much deeper love take the time at the beginning however and it feels to me as though the second stage can be reached much more rapidly for many dads the stuff about feeling like a spare part isnt incorrect if they arent around fulltime for long they might feel like the secondary parent right from the beginning standing outside this womans world as kate bush has it in this womans work her moving and daring song about fatherhood dads who are thrown back into the office after a couple of weeks never get the chance to bond with their children which is horrible my colleague alex hern told me he took six months to be his daughters primary caregiver thats the part that is unimaginable to me it just feels from the privileged vantage point of not having had to do that like such an awful thing to inflict on a new parent theres a huge difference between looking after your baby and being in charge of your baby and it was crucial for my relationship with my partner for me to have been in charge of my daughter for long enough that i stopped asking how she had done things and started doing things my way it means weve come out the other side of leave with an approach to parenting that blends both our experiences this is backed by the research sociology professors paul hodkinson and rachel brooks whose book sharing care examines the experiences of fathers who have taken more of an active role in sharing care for their children conclude that the sharing of parental leave from early in babies lives may make it easier for caregiving fathers to take on full responsibility for emotional and organisational aspects of care later on this would help alleviate the disproportionate care burden that continues to fall on women though weve enjoyed shared parental leave it was unpaid so we have taken a large financial hit and ive been writing this column throughout as a policy it has been a failure with only of eligible couples taking it the uk government has yet to publish the results of its longpromised consultation on this policy it is still not available to the selfemployed its also unnecessarily confusing and took me a couple of weeks to get my own head around it simply because it was so poorly explained by most websites according to a new survey from pregnant then screwed just half of dads believe their employer understands how shared parental leave works it breaks down the numerous ways in which men are discouraged from taking the time from the financial hit cited by more than half of dads as the reason for not taking shared parental leave to discrimination in the workplace the fact that the shared parental leave policy involves taking leave from your female partner is spectacularly illconceived with women not wanting to relinquish their time and some dads not wanting to deprive their partners of it as for our pathetic two weeks of paternity leave of respondents do not believe that two weeks is long enough and one in four dads say that they continued to work while on paternity leave with half saying that there was an expectation from their employer that they would which is unlawful though companies are starting to offer enhanced parental leave to men if the uk is to catch up with the many other countries that offer properly paid ringfenced paternity leave we need to rip up the shared parental leave policy and start again this is one of the demands of the pregnant then screwed march of the mummies a national protest for parents on october its other demands are good quality affordable childcare for all children and flexible working as the default if men want more time with their children they are going to have to fight for it alongside their partners the key to this i think is to start framing paternity leave as crucial bonding time for men and their children which they are currently being denied as my husband says its been one of the most rewarding times of his life it should be a right not a privilege whats working i took the baby swimming last week his dad is taking him this week and watching six babies and their parents a mix of mums and dads discover the joys of the water was almost unbearably cute and completely worth the screaming fit he threw

as justine roberts says there is a crisis in the affordability and availability of good quality childcare in the uk i asked boris johnson about the childcare crisis his response more tumble tots june but her suggestion that a system of governmentbacked childcare loans would solve the financial dilemmas they face would be laughable if it were not so serious especially after the lessons which should have been learned about the student loans system loans for childcare will not solve this problem for parents many of whom struggle to provide their children with adequate food clothing shoes and heating when they are at home but this misses the main point which is that all children are entitled to at least the basics of a decent life as they grow up we all know and understand the research which shows that childrens physical emotional social and educational needs must be met for them to have a good chance of positive healthy outcomes later in life it is not rocket science we know its true good quality free childcare available to all should be the ultimate aim in the meantime childcare properly subsidised through the tax system should be introduced costs could be topped up by payments from parents who work fulltime and have sufficient earnings if it can work in other countries such as finland why cant we make it work here it is not a luxury or a choice it is an urgent necessity for our children our society and all our futures deborah kaplinsky london laura bates is absolutely right to point out the extraordinary difficulty that many women face when childcare costs rise and their pay does not childcare costs are forcing women in britain out of work it neednt be this way june however it is not only women who decide to stay at home with their preschool children my husband was delighted to sacrifice his economic security to be an athome father and in the days when flexible working was in its infancy he carved out a second career for himself albeit one that paid less than my job meanwhile i found it an onerous responsibility being the main breadwinner for the family and there were times when i felt that i missed out there are gains and losses on both sides that are not purely economic undoubtedly there is a longterm financial hit when it comes to occupational pensions which is something that needs to be discussed between parents early on to ensure mutual longerterm financial security perhaps employers should also contribute something as parents with a partner at home wont need to disrupt their employers business when it comes to children being

at what age do we become capable of love our nineweekold baby seems grateful for his milk and hes started smiling at his parents and grandparents but could he really be said to feel love sam rockley london send new questions to nqtheguardiancom readers reply moments after we complete our initial eightmonthlong underwater journey and emerge safely into the arms of our mother who is as relieved and delighted as we are richard orlando we start to form lasting memories when we start to put our experiences into words i think the same is true of love my eldest son is four and weve been reading winniethepooh oh mummy how i do love you he says borrowing a classic line from aa milne while wrapping his arms around me settling his head on to my shoulder he says it with a spontaneity and depth of feeling that go beyond his four years of life and i know what he says to be true my littlest one on the other hand is one and threequarters and while he certainly likes me i cant say he loves me yet i am a vehicle that delivers what he needs namely entertainment and stimulation food drink and the means to sleep he is a simple creature not a bear of very little brain but a creature of habit and if his vital needs are met then all is well in his world so in answer to your question i would say we learn to love somewhere between one and threequarters and four jessica hatchermoore from day one a newborn can distinguish between its mother and the rest of the world being close to her and locking eyes with her brings up oxytocin in both of them so if love is a mixture of hormones and the wish to be close to somebody it is all there at birth rushfieldrye love within a family starts so young as to be hard to tie down outside that i remember clearly the day i first fell in love with another human being it was at a kindergarten in and i was four or five i can picture her dark frightened eyes quite clearly now jolyon elsmore capable what an interesting question i felt profound love for my daughter on first glimpse and i felt she reciprocated that love as she focused on my eyes almost immediately alas alack once i put her in the bath at home she gazed with absolute adoration at the bath set two taps separated by a long water outlet above her i realised there is some primal recognition of the configuration of eyes and nose and the water outlet was a particularly fine nose undeterred i continued to love her deeply within weeks she realised the bath set was unresponsive and switched all her gurgles and burbles to the people who truly loved her joinoz this all depends on what love is meant to constitute if love is seen as a gist of fullness happiness satiation or bliss then the answer is perhaps before we even see the baby ie prebirth the older the baby is the more expressive their response to care becomes from a blissful sleep a calm face a warm smile excitement reaching the stage where the child is capable of expressing gratitude verbally however wellrehearsed phrases of gratitude warmth or love are not to be mistaken for love but more as an expression of feeling loved and wanted freud called the selfserving princess his majesty the baby denoting the childs focus on gain rather than giving and perhaps explaining the cheekiness in their pursuit of material and emotional rewards by expressing loving words and gestures in other words its all about them even when it seems about the other the decisive point in my opinion that transcends the experience of the childs apparent expression of love to a real love is when the child is able to put themselves in the others shoes this is called the theory of mind and its a pivotal developmental stage as it enables the child to appreciate the others perspective the baby realises that their hugs make mummy and daddy happy just like theirs do to himher and starts to give them freely and generously the aim could be said here to be reciprocal ie i make my parent happy and i become happy too this is the point when the child feels empathy and responds by attempting to console the sad or distressed parent most parents are able to identify the change in the quality of tenderness offered by the child this developmental landmark emerges between the age of three and a half and five dr hosam elhamoui a baby feels love but doesnt know it im coming round to thinking we only realise our love for our parents once we lose them is this pessimistic i dont think so we take our parents for granted which is a kind of love i felt the full force of my love for my parents when i lost them megabarross love is not a fixed thing there are all sorts of different definitions familial religious spiritual sexual and perhaps most dangerously the love of a homeland these things can be felt ardently or hardly at all selflessness is possibly the one condition common to all aspects of love children learn the value of that at a very young age although there will always be an internal battle between self interest and a desire to put others first romantic love may actually be the most selfserving of all forms of love since its evolution is intimately tied to the preservation of our own unique genetic information thegreatfatsby my understanding of love is that its the name we give to the emotion of a bond with another dependence on them appreciation of their presence and feeling of loss if they are gone surely then most humans are born with this ability their first relationship being with their mother and expanding out from there i certainly felt that my children loved me from the day they were born possibly projection but the instinct was powerful neeny id say that the age depends on the definition of love that you choose to an infant yes a very early love can mean a vague awareness of and emotional attachment to the caring humans who it senses are the source of its warmth and security to a teenager a different and powerful sort of love means sexual awakening combined with romantic idealisation of the unattainable object of desire to many an older person experienced in matters of the heart im told lateflowering love means a hardearned treasured sense of mutual understanding and deep affection manifested in

during the first lockdown i had a call with the same group of three female friends every wednesday evening we would spend an hour or two chatting over video and however doomful the day had been the evening would be brighter and sillier its no exaggeration to say that those conversations kept me going a lifeline when it felt that so many of our personal relationships were drifting and i didnt skip a single one we four are now closer than ever yet there are other friends i havent seen and have hardly spoken to since march perhaps you had a similar experience during a time when many of us felt forced to examine the shape of our friendships whom you could face speaking to and who inspired little more than a sense of duty to keep in touch if you did at all we got used to prioritising our pals first virtually and later seeing a small number in person when the rules allowed many of our friendships were simply parked not ended but not maintained we pressed pause assuming those friends would be equally happy to pick things back up when the pandemic storm had passed plus we were dealing with new and strange friendship dilemmas how do i tell her that im uncomfortable with not wearing a mask that i dont want to sneak into her kitchen for supper that i dont agree with her facebook post its little wonder that a survey by marketing agency digital third coast found of people had unfriended a friend over a covid disagreement on social media now though were supposed to be almost back to normal maskwearing has dropped off and large gatherings have returned fewer commuters on trains and empty offices are our only significant daily reminder that all is not what it was well that and our friendships because even now months after the last restrictions were lifted some of us are still finding it tough to get them back on track when speaking to women for my new book on female friendship i encountered a groundswell of lingering resentment and hurt it looks as if some of those friends we put on the backburner are destined to never come off one woman in her s tells me that the postpandemic fallout in her friend group has worsened over the past few weeks theres a lot of bitterness she says friends of mine are having blowup arguments and accusing one another of not having been there when it mattered friendships of or years are ending a recent poll by lifesearch found that almost one in three of surveyed uk adults have fallen out with friends due to pandemic pressures losing an average of four friends since covid began in march google published a list of our mostsearchedfor subjects over the past months at an alltime high were questions such as how can i meet new friends and is it normal to be jealous of your friendsargue with friendsnot to have any friends some people are upset that their friends werent there for them in the way they hoped during the lockdowns but some are upset that their friends arent there for them now during a time of need that few of us thought we would experience clinical psychologist dr sophie mort tells me we imagined that once the lockdowns were over we would feel liberated by being back out in the world but what im seeing in my clinic and my social circles suggests that the ongoing struggles in our friendships link to the fact that many people still feel at their limit prepandemic one or two people in a friendship group would usually have struggles at any one time meaning that the others would be able to offer support now it seems most people are facing something tough this means that few of us are able to support our friends the way we usually would it means friendships arent functioning the way that they used to its the pandemic friendship paradox we were going through perhaps the ultimate communal experience yet we became overwhelmed and disconnected from each other it tested our core beliefs and shared values as well as sapping our time and energy and were not out of the woods yet women in their s and s have particularly struggled as the demands of home schooling childcare and domestic chores left little time for maintaining friendships this is the same cohort who according to new research are struggling to return to their careers postcovid and going missing from the workforce when your friendships usually feel deep and connected disconnection or distance can feel like a rejection which often leads to resentment anger sadness and confusion says mort i havent lost any friends yet but there are some relationships that are slowly coming apart at the seams so is it too late mort believes not and says its time we started to speak honestly with our friends its a case of working out what could be done to improve a friendship do you need to tell your friend that you miss them do you need to say that you need their support many of us think that an argument or a period of silence equals the end when actually if dealt with effectively it can strengthen the friendship a key part is the ability to apologise being able to say im sorry is extremely powerful there are always ways to improve your friendships the first question is whether you want to claire

for the first time in decades the number of women not returning to work after having a baby is on the rise to find the reason why we dont have to look much further than the spiralling cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two which has risen from an average of a week in to in that means for many women with two or more young children the cost of childcare far outstrips their salary the numbers simply dont add up we are also witnessing the gendered aftereffects of the height of the pandemic when mothers of small children lost work at three times the rate of fathers as research from the london school of economics found the government consistently failed to consider gender in its response to covid these women are described as economically inactive a misnomer that lays bare the extent to which our economy fails to acknowledge the unpaid labour of women some commentators have suggested that the number of women leaving the workforce is the result of a realignment of priorities which suggests that it is a pleasant choice women have happily made for themselves but a survey of parents revealed that childcare costs have forced of mothers to consider leaving their jobs and to work fewer hours as always it is the most vulnerable mothers who are paying the highest price the cost of living crisis means that one in four parents have had to cut down on necessary expenses such as food or heating to afford childcare choices no family should have to make the colossal cracks in our childcare system exacerbate child poverty as well as devastating womens economic participation and it isnt only the cost of childcare that is holding women back but also the difficulty of accessing it in ways that fit around paid work with the government sending a strong message that it expects employees to return to offices many women have found that their employers arent prepared to accept reasonable flexible working requests that would allow them to make childcare and working hours compatible it seems to have escaped the governments notice that not all of us are incapable of working effectively from home without being distracted by chunks of cheese for some women the ability to work flexibly isnt a matter of snacks its the choice between holding down a job or being forced out of the workplace altogether the preschool years may be a relatively short period but they have longlasting effects women who return to work after a childcare break when their children start school will face the prejudice and disadvantages of a system that views their time off as a black mark on their cv and does not recognise the injustice that caused it nor appreciate the stunningly complex set of skills they will have acquired during that time when the labour of childcare goes unpaid and underappreciated so too do the considerable transferable skills that come with it further down the road we are creating another timebomb the eventual impact on the pensions of women who are already fighting the unjust impact the system has had on them when a system is built by and for men when women are simply not included in the equation they will continue to be collateral damage perhaps most outrageous of all is that the governments response to this has been to suggest trying to make childcare cheaper by loosening the rules around the number of children that nursery staff can care for a proposition described by experts as a disaster for the sector research has shown that less regulation leads to poorquality provision without fees going down and experts have warned that ratio relaxations would only exacerbate the already existing crisis of recruitment and retention of earlyyears staff there is no loophole or easy way out here the government will balk at the idea of investing millions in the childcare sector but it is an investment not a cost it is estimated that if womens participation in work was as high in the uk as a whole as it already is in the southwest of england it could add bn a year to the uks economy and government investment is needed desperately the average wage in the uk earlyyears sector is a measly an hour below minimum wage yet of childcare providers say that government funding for the three and fouryearold early entitlement scheme does not cover the cost of delivering places causing many to operate at a loss and a significant number of settings to close their doors permanently adding yet further pressure on working parents as places become increasingly scarce the uk could learn a few lessons from luxembourg where the government provides up to hours free a week and subsidised childcare to all children aged between one and four or iceland which offers lengthy largely nontransferable leave to both parents paid at of average income mandating the right to flexible working rather than the toothless right to request and normalising uptake among men as well as women would also be steps in the right direction toward sharing the burden of childcare equally between men and women there are solutions that can support our childrens development and womens careers the real question is whether our

the cost of childcare has soared over the past decade and is now more than a year higher than it was in according to analysis from the trades union congress tuc as people in the uk struggle with the cost of living crisis parents face some of the highest childcare costs among leading economies according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the tuc said its analysis showed the average annual nursery bill for a family with a child under two had increased by since from to in it said nursery fees for undertwos had risen by a month or a year since the conservatives

contribute to the economy but extortionate costs are pricing them out of the labour market and back into the home the tuc is calling for the childcare sector to receive financial help from the government to make it more affordable and increase wages for childcare workers and criticised the governments mooted plans to cut staffing ratios ogrady said it was the last thing we need it would

im an early education and care childcare policy nerd im sure nerds in other policy areas would be familiar with a game i play its one where i fantasise that ive suddenly been appointed as the minister for my special policy area how would i prioritise whats most important so much needs to be done in childcare in australia that choosing just three things to work on first would be really hard it is no exaggeration to say that our childcare system is on the verge of collapse with services are unable to recruit the educators they need there are about vacancies now and its estimated we will need another educators by next year in addition fewer australian children have access to early education and care than children in other countries hence our new prime ministers desire to have universal access it costs their families way too much with research showing that childcare is unaffordable for about of all families and of lowincome families despite government funding of around bn a year our country still invests less in this area than other countries we have an insanely complex system where the states have some responsibility for some parts of early education and the commonwealth for other bits and did i mention its still an almighty struggle for some families to actually find the care they need crap thats a lot more work than my three wishes can fix first if i was the minister i would be funding education and services so they could increase the wages of their staff the workforce crisis cant wait for inquiries or reports the main reason we have a crisis is that educators and early childhood teachers are paid shit wages if we fund services to increase wages more people will want to join or stay in the sector id also set up better systems to train the staff needed a wellfunded tafe for starters and fund organisations to offer free professional development and resources so the huge burden on the directors that run our services is lessened even slightly they are seriously close to breaking second i would abolish the child care subsidy system introduced by the morrison government it is so bad that even their own evaluation of it found that it didnt make childcare more accessible affordable or flexible it just made everything more complex how would i change it id fund services themselves not the families that used them this would give me the lever i needed to ensure they provided highquality education and care and pay their staff well if they didnt i would defund them third i would make it illegal for publicly listed corporations and multinational private equity funds or australian ones for that matter to make a profit out of caring for our children because the fact that they do on the strength of taxpayer dollars sickens me big time some of those services are consistently found to provide significantly lower quality than community or not for profit services id nationalise the ones already owned by these moneygrubbers and make it clear there would no longer be any gravy trains for others with an eye on making a quick buck by this stage of living my fantasy i usually come back to earth and realise that im not the minister and never will be but we do have a newly appointed minister for early education dr anne aly and luckily her boss anthony albanese wants childcare early education to be one of the big things his government fixes the prime minister says he wants universal childcare and has promised it will be cheaper for parents he has promised to fix gendered wage disparities the fact that of the education and care workforce is women explains the low wages he has also promised a comprehensive early years strategy the education minister jason clare has also said that early education is one of his first priorities so what three things should aly and the new labor government actually do to start the fix of early education in australia of course aly is more than welcome to steal my ideas but if she wants to come up with her own she still needs to tackle these key areas the workforce shortages the overly complex subsidy system that still leads to families paying too much and the excessive profiteering by big business with their nose in the trough of australian childrens early learning and care as a fantasy early childhood education and youth minister i understand how hard it can be to change things so i reckon this would be a reasonable agenda for aly to undertake well at least for her first week as the minister lisa bryant is an advocate for education and care in australia and a consultant to education and care services,2022-06,im early education care childcare policy nerd im sure nerd policy area would familiar game play one fantasise ive suddenly appointed minister special policy area would prioritise whats important much need done childcare australia choosing three thing work first would really hard exaggeration say childcare system verge collapse service unable

the government has responded to the worsening crisis in the early years sector in the most unimaginative way by suggesting that the ratio of staff to toddlers should be relaxed the theory is that raising the number of twoyearolds who can be cared for by a single adult from four to five will make nursery places cheaper but this only works if adults agree to do more work for the same money and if adding extra children to a setting does not increase costs other than pay given that the early years sector already has some of the lowest pay rates the proposal is insulting and unjust to the women who make up more than of staff as well as unlikely to deliver what ministers want a suggestion from the conservative leadership contender liz truss that parents with caring responsibilities could qualify for a new tax break is concerning for a different reason namely that it would incentivise mothers to give up paid work the fact that ministers cant come up with anything more original a decade after ms truss first proposed to alter staffing ratios shows the extent to which the governing party is stuck with deregulation its only trick the reality is that policymakers need to get a much firmer grip on what is going on in this crucially important area even before covid pushed some providers out of business and mothers out of work due to the impossibility of fitting childcare around a job in pandemic conditions there was a great deal to be worried about what has happened over the past years is financialisation as in some other public services particularly social care the nursery sector has been targeted by private equity and is now characterised by debt lack of transparency complex tax arrangements in multiple jurisdictions and splits between holding and operating companies why profitmaking businesses were ever deemed the most appropriate providers of care and early years education is obscure this is the opposite approach from that taken to schools but what is now under way in england is the transformation of a sector that was previously a patchwork of small and larger businesses including selfemployed childminders and nonprofit and state nurseries while estimates vary due to gaps in data up to of early years places are now run by businesses some of which pay little or no tax research shows that they tend to pay staff less than voluntary nurseries seek less involvement from parents and show less commitment to principles of inclusivity one provider took more money out of its charitable foundation over the course of a year than it put in with childcare costs among the highest in europe and salaries of nursery workers too low the current system is stacked in favour of privateequity owners and no one else over time it requires an overhaul right now ministers should insist on transparency with regard to public funds the government spends about bn a year on early years provision in england plus bn via the tax and benefits systems and make community involvement a condition of operating funding must also be increased to cover the cost of what are supposed to be free parttime places but for which providers must currently crosssubsidise or seek topups talk of relaxing ratios or a tax break for parents is inadequate do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article if you would like to submit a letter of up to

did you do a poo is one of those questions none of us really likes to hear so i sympathise with my son who gets asked this about six times a day always by me its ok just be honest with me i say like one of those hostage negotiators in films whose main shtick appears to be pretending that taking hostages is actually fine and if the kidnapper just comes clean well forget all about it and go our separate ways in fairness to him he is fully toilet trained or at least he was but he started regressing around the time the baby arrived since then a few checkins have been necessary i had worried it was all about his new sister that he felt spurned or starved of love and was somehow neglecting his toilet training in order to win back some much needed attention however it seems a main spur for toilet regression is just the increasing focus that comes with age an inability to tear oneself away from a toy or task in the time it takes to make it to the bathroom this does bear out since ive many times wondered if i could make my millions pitching lego an ad centred entirely on how many times kids will soil themselves where they stand rather than take a break from assembling malformed multicoloured sheds piece by piece once i nail a good slogan that works off shit a brick the cheques will be in the post not that his sisters arrival hasnt produced some odd effects jumping on the spot when he sees her pawing at her little hands and kissing her cheeks as if shes so cute it causes him pain he is it turns out a test case in cute aggression a behaviour we all recognise but probably couldnt name that indescribable bubbling urge to squeeze or eat something thats adorable when we describe babies as unbearably cute this is the part thats unbearable that weirdly powerful impulse to grit your teeth and clench your fists and say strange things to them specifically that you would very much like to eat said baby either in part or whole it is a curious urge and more curious still for being universal and almost entirely unremarked upon not only do i feel comfortable telling parents i want to eat their babies im immensely gratified to hear people say it about my own baby in fact had no one ever told me they wanted to eat my baby or several of her limbs id be offended we do have to watch my son closely when he introduces her to people like when he showcases her to his cousin ardal and his introduction veers from here is my sister to oh no i want to eat her again and we send him upstairs to ardals room to play lego at bedtime shes all he wants to talk about until i ask how his poos went that day i did one earlier he says in ardals room but i stuck it in a book thanks for telling me that i say through gritted teeth picking up the phone did ye hear

families will have to fork out almost for six weeks of holiday childcare for each schoolage child according to a survey a increase on last years prices the average place at a holiday club now costs a week which is more than double what parents pay for an afterschool club during term time according to the charity coram family and childcare as a result parents summer outlay will be almost more than they would pay for six weeks of termtime childcare before and after school forcing many to take unpaid leave to look after their children rather than incur the additional holiday costs according to corams annual holiday childcare survey not only is holiday childcare expensive but availability is patchy especially for disabled children and there is considerable regional variation in prices parents in inner london for example will pay an average of a week compared with in the west midlands in england the average weekly holiday cost is a annual increase in wales it is up and in scotland it is a annual rise though coram cautions there was a low response rate to that question in scotland the coram survey also shows that little over a quarter of english local authorities have enough holiday childcare places available for parents in their area who work fulltime down six points on last year for parents of disabled children only of councils can meet demand down from in ellen broome the managing director of coram family and childcare said holiday childcare is key economic infrastructure the lack of childcare places for working parents is a serious problem not just for families but for the countrys economic output many parents particularly mothers will have no choice but to be locked out of work altogether or struggle to pay for basic necessities such as food or rent helen hayes the shadow minister for children and early years said the conservatives failure to fix the soaring costs of childcare is increasingly forcing parents particularly mothers out of their careers families are already struggling with rising bills and food prices and now face paying in childcare costs per child this summer highquality affordable childcare is essential after years of failing to get a grip on spiralling childcare costs the conservatives are now too busy warring amongst themselves to prioritise parents concerns a labour government will put our children and families first a government spokesperson said we have spent more than bn in each of the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare and have set out plans to help providers run their businesses more

im supposed to be writing about joy but ive just been crying my eyes out nothing major just the physical aftermath of illness sleep deprivation and a baby whose celtic roots are manifesting themselves in an extreme hatred of hot weather the thing i am learning about parenthood is that the lows can feel very low but they are also transient because the joy oh my god the joy it carries you through the cult of motherhood of course needs no more cheerleaders the fact that we are all supposed to be so happyclappy about child rearing has been the source of much maternal unhappiness and frustration several women have confessed to me that they didnt feel that powerful golden oxytocin high youre supposed to feel after giving birth instead the joy grew and grew as they got to know their babies but still they felt guilty the trouble is i am happyclappy literally i am happy and i am clappy because i know it as the song ive been singing to him endlessly would have it the baby is a delight at the moment having learned to laugh he is doing these big widemouthed gurgly giggles when hes not a delight hes a challenge but the delight makes the hard parts survivable it can be hard to feel sorry for yourself for long when a baby is giggling at your silliness one of the few things i wasnt told about babies before embarking on this journey was that you are supposed to pump their little legs in a bicycle motion to make the wind come out that was news to me i do this while continuously chanting pumpy pumpy it is silly and ridiculous and admitting this probably means i will never be considered a writer of serious intellectual importance but i have come to realise that any parent worth their salt can only maintain a very low level of gravitas in the face of a small child who demands to be entertained i speak motherese now as linguists call baby talk its a term my own mother despises and she still hasnt forgiven noam chomsky and steven pinker for giving mothers little credit for a childs language acquisition but as i said to my son because i was changing him while his grandmother and i discussed this they are men so they would say that wouldnt they mr poopypants i suppose thats the tradeoff you make when you have a child some people will cease to take you as seriously especially if youre a woman but in exchange you also get to not take yourself so seriously and there is so much happiness to be found in that im still using my brain why do i feel the need to say this but i have found a new freedom in lightness too i have written before that i could have done with a bit more joy and a lot less fearmongering and negativity during pregnancy i put this down to an overcorrection of the historical taboo of expressing discontent with the demands of mothering but i think parents are sometimes circumspect about joy for other reasons too especially around people who do not have children but want them in her book ongoingness sarah manguso writes my life felt full before becoming a mother but ive found that trying to say that i prefer having the baby sounds aggressive in fact id felt affronted before i was a parent when parents told me even in the gentlest terms that they preferred having their children to not having them when i wanted a baby so much that it felt as though the longing for it would suffocate me other peoples joy could feel like a personal slight it is a very difficult thing to want a baby and to not have one in claire lynchs memoir small on motherhoods she writes of the slow agony of being unable to conceive the stinging blows the unexpected shock of other peoples happiness and then the guilt of getting what you always wanted followed by a failure to be discreet about her happiness despite promising herself she would the other problem is that care work is work it is some of the hardest work that i have ever done and i have prior experience so it was hardly a shock but it is also love and with that love comes joy the two are so tightly bound together that to highlight one is in the eyes of some to detract from the other its bizarre because you wouldnt be expected to do any other job for free even if you love it yet to do the work of mothering and to find joy in it but to also want recompense for it and societal support is often framed as an unreasonable demand despite our economic reliance on all that unpaid labour and so the joy gets dampened down as we make our political demands it is only relatively recently that i learned to square the feminist in me with the carer in me the latter is a role i played for much of my adolescence and though i have never seen it as unfairly foisted upon me i never truly appreciated how fulfilling it could be there is beauty and grace in caring for another person in tending to their body and their needs i always saw it in others but i never appreciated it in myself now when my boy is crying and i reach for him and hold him in my arms and see him settle into sleep i take pleasure and validation in that and yes joy whats working ive given him his first newspaper its a crinkly sensory cloth book called the nursery times and all of the stories are about dinosaurs but you have to start somewhere whats not im still angry about the offensive suggestion that the government tax people without children as a response to the declining birthrate ive been monitoring such natalist

the cost of childcare over the holidays is likely to be the highest on record this summer as providers of activity camps and other paidfor care are forced to put up prices while others have gone out of business altogether a leading national charity concerned with childcare and family issues said that a cocktail of rising costs including higher utility bills food prices and national insurance contributions is contributing to pressures on holiday care providers providers are struggling to make ends meet and balance their books in the face of the cost of living crisis said ellen broom the managing director of coram family and childcare obviously were seeing record levels of inflation across the economy i think it is very likely all of that will translate into record prices for childcare this summer the charity is due to release its th annual survey into the cost of holiday childcare on tuesday because a number of childcare providers have gone out of business since last year there are also likely to be fewer places available and the places that are left have become more expensive some parents particularly in rural areas are scrabbling around to find any childcare at all quite a lot of providers didnt make it through the pandemic said broom they were already operating at the margins and the cost pressures were just too much providers have also closed because demand for childcare in some areas has fallen outside school holidays as more parents work from home for some or all of the working week broom said patterns of working have changed over the pandemic other families simply cannot afford to pay the high price of childcare people have been forced to rely on family and friends anyone however who does need or want childcare over the summer holidays should expect to pay more than they ever have before and to travel further to find it its going to be a really challenging summer for parents said broom she expects a proportion of parents particularly single parents will end up paying just to go to work during the summer holidays due to the cost of holiday childcare they will make no money or have to pay to stay in work in hertfordshire chloe and scott sweden are about to spend a week to send their two children lana nine and taylor seven to a summer camp for fiveandahalf hours a day each parent will take an hour out of their day to drive the children there and back because their usual holiday camp provider which was much closer has closed down when you add in the cost of petrol and their lunches its extortionate chloe said last year it would probably have cost her about less a week she estimates chloe works from home running her own business a benefits app called plants perks that rewards employees for making sustainable choices and is trying to save up to buy an electric car unable to afford to pay more than one week of camp she has decided to keep the children at home with her for most of the summer luckily my daughter likes coding on her computer and my son loves watching tv even so she is dreading having to balance working and looking after them i have to work all summer because im launching a free version of my app in september and i know they will come in and disturb me frequently ill have to say to every person i have a business meeting with im sorry i dont have childcare the children might pop in that will be the caveat with every single conversation i have she also feels guilty about how her children are spending their summer in front of screens it feels awful because during the pandemic they were basically on screens theres all this pressure too to make the summer amazing for them an idyllic summer holiday they will always remember i feel quite stressed,2022-07,cost childcare holiday likely

while millions of children relish the summer holidays many parents are frantically worrying about how they will get any work done before the schools open their gates again in september the childrens charity coram family and childcares last holiday childcare survey showed that parents paid more than twice the weekly termtime cost for childcare in the summer meanwhile a third of councils said they did not have enough places for children whose parents worked fulltime its incredibly difficult says the charitys managing director ellen broom over the summer and as we go into the autumn it will be really challenging for many and there will be parents for whom it simply wont make any sense to work theyll be locked out of a job the charity is due to publish its latest holiday childcare survey on july and says broom it is likely to show price increases and ongoing challenges around childcare availability alicia ieronymides is a paediatric community nurse based in watford she works from am to pm three days a week plus some weekends and oncall shifts her husband micky a web developer commuted to london several times a month before the coronavirus pandemic but now works from home fulltime its just as well alicia says i wouldnt be able to do my job if he wasnt at home alicia leaves the house before am and micky takes ely seven and roo five to school in the morning and twoyearold ivy to her childminder after school he picks up the older children and takes them to the childminder so he can finish his working day it is costly the ieronymides family estimate they pay about a month in childcare taking into account childcare vouchers and its a juggle but it works as for the summer holidays it is anxietyinducing alicia says her annual leave is restricted to no more than two weeks in the summer the rest of the time the children will be going to a variety of clubs and childminders while their parents work the difficult thing is that the clubs dont run all summer some last three weeks some are only three days a week so thats no good if they are not my work days alicia says they are short days too ampm which is difficult the family will be mixing and matching activities with the three children often in different places i have a spreadsheet so i can plan what everyone is doing and when she says last year i showed it to my parents with the days when we were stuck and they covered those ones this year my best friend will be helping too then theres the cost they ruled out signing up for a club at a farm that was charging about a day but still have a club at the local primary school a day a football club about a week and an outdoor forest school a day alicia will use the money she has saved through the childcare voucher scheme towards the fees but she says i dont like to think too much about the cost because it feels like i dont have a lot of choice one bit of good news for parents is that the government schemes set up to help with childcare costs such as taxfree childcare can also be used for eligible holiday clubs and activities parents should check to see whether theyre using their income in as taxefficient way as possible to pay for childcare says emma corina the director of strategic planning at ymca fairthorne group covering hampshire and the isle of wight which offers day and residential holiday clubs lots of providers are registered to accept those types of payments as well which can really bring the cost down rushani mahendran the product and operations manager at mamacodes a coding school for children will be looking after her children kya seven and neo four without using any external childcare while her husband raj usually goes to the office mahendran works from home i try to wake up an hour or so before the children to work then when they get up i make sure i am completely with them to start the day thats usually between am and am after that comes two hours of designated work time i schedule meetings and so on during that time and the children play independently she then stops work for lunch with the children and gets back at her desk in the afternoon when the kids might read a book or watch a film and then play a game related to the story dividing up the day this way is possible because the company mahendran works for has built in a parentfriendly flexible approach theres a lot of asynchronous working so colleagues dont always need to be available at the same time and between am and am when im with the children i make it clear that im not going to be available and will respond later it is tough but persevering with it has really paid off the children have learned to be quite independent and to occupy themselves when im busy working the rising cost of childcare is a huge headache for millions of parents according to coram family and childcare parttime hours a week childcare for a child under two now costs on average at a nursery in great britain while fulltime hours a week typically costs it is marginally cheaper with a childminder and respectively for schoolage children the cost of afterschool clubs and childminders may be lower but it can still be prohibitive the weekly cost of an afterschool club in great britain is on average while a childminder until pm costs on average prices tend to track above the base rate of inflation broom says the other barrier parents face is the availability of childcare which makes it quite a toxic mix only of local authorities say they have enough childcare for disabled children and only have enough for parents working fulltime only of local authorities can cater to the childcare needs of people working atypical hours and a quarter have enough afterschool facilities for five to yearolds one of the issues broom says is a brewing recruitment and retention crisis in early years childcare it is something that emma dewey the founder of babyem a company specialising in training for childcare professionals has seen firsthand deweys company has worked with childminders au pairs maternity nurses and nannies but today she is seeing a significant shift in the industry since brexit and covid i have seen our training numbers dip we are a sector that is full of people from all over the world and so many people have gone to their home country dewey says the au pair sector has disappeared this in turn places extra pressure on other childcare places theres a finite number of childcare providers says richard conway the chief executive of childcarecouk a platform that allows parents to find local providers and there is a very high demand especially after things like brexit when a lot of the european childcare providers who had been working here have gone which has left a shortfall how to find childcare every local authority must provide a family information service they have lists of all registered provision in their area whether that is childminders holiday clubs breakfast clubs and so on they can help with brokering and give information on financial support around childcare broom says childcarecouk allows parents to post their childcare requirements from ad hoc babysitters to livein nannies and to invite providers to get in touch while providers can also place adverts too full membership is for two weeks and to remain a member after that costs a month what help can you get here are some of the official schemes taxfree childcare for every you pay into an online account the government puts in an extra up to a maximum of a child a year or for disabled children this is for working families including the selfemployed in the uk with children under under if disabled you use it to pay for registered childcare a childminder nursery etc however the provider must be signed up to benefit you must each earn on average at least a week but less than a year childcare vouchers this programme closed to new applicants in october but those who signed up prior to that can pay for childcare via salary sacrifice which cuts the cost by allowing you to pay from your pretax salary thirty hours free childcare available to working families in england with three and fouryearold children it lets you get hours of free childcare or early education for weeks universal credit for childcare with this you may be able to claim back up to of your childcare costs it is for working families claiming

one in of all uk children now live in families hit by the twochild limit the governments controversial cap on benefits that cuts household income by at least a year and puts affected youngsters at risk of poverty and emotional harm the latest official statistics revealed that million children in households were subject to the twochild limit in april as the policy dragged an additional kids in families into its net new research into the impact on affected children found they suffered social and emotional harms as a result of their parents finding it almost impossible to afford basic needs from food and nappies and new shoes to buying birthday presents for friends the study by york and oxford academics found the continuation of the policy during the cost of living crisis was creating an almost impossible context for affected families with a risk of longlasting harm for millions of children asked about cost of living pressures asma a mother interviewed as part of the benefit changes and larger families project said if anything i think it is about to get worse things are going up so high so you know that is worrying i dont think there is any hope at the moment a briefing by the project said we hear a great deal of the heatoreat dilemma that households in poverty routinely face families affected by the benefit cap and twochild limit also told us about the stressful and difficult decisions they face choosing which of their childrens basic needs to meet the new figures were published as the government started to issue the first tranche of a oneoff flat rate payment to around million lowincome uk families to help them cope with the rising cost of living campaigners said this payment offered little comfort to those already falling deeper into poverty at a time of rising prices todays emergency cost of living payment does nowhere near enough to pull them back said alison garnham chief executive of the child poverty action group the twochild limit restricts some benefit payments to the first two children born to the poorest households after april affected households claiming universal credit or tax credits lose a week for their third and subsequent children the policy was introduced five years ago as an attempt to cut the welfare bill and supposedly prevent benefit scroungers having large families with one minister declaring that it would teach feckless parents the reality that children cost money however a recent analysis revealed that since the policys introduction the fertility rate for third and subsequent children born to poorer families has barely fallen instead it has become the biggest single driver of child poverty especially for families with three or more children the policy was also recently disavowed by the tory peer lord freud the former welfare reform minister who called it vicious and an excrescence and said it had been imposed by the treasury against the wishes of the work and pensions ministerial team at the time the latest figures showed that despite ministers belief that the twochild limit would incentivise work of the families affected by the limit are already working some mothers received a special exemption from the twochild limit after they reported that their third or subsequent child was born as a result of rape or in the official jargon nonconsensual conception a department for work and pensions spokesperson said this policy means families on benefits are asked to make the same financial decisions as families supporting themselves solely through work including considering our comprehensive childcare offer for working parents and child benefit for all children meanwhile to help with rising prices over million households on benefits are in line to receive the first instalment of our cost

it has happened to us all sitting on the sofa toying with the idea of sending an old friend an unexpected text but worrying that a message out of the blue may seem weird intrusive or just plain unwelcome however research suggests such fears are unfounded with those on the receiving end often far more grateful than the sender may expect whats more the study suggests the more of a surprise a message or small gift is the greater the appreciation the recipient feels many people have lost touch with others in their lives including many friends despite wanting to reconnect i think many people are hesitant about doing so said dr peggy liu of the university of pittsburgh the lead author of the research these findings suggest that their hesitations may be misplaced as others are likely to appreciate being reached out to more than people think liu said the team began their research because they felt a lot of people were losing touch with each other more and more we wondered why that might be she said writing in the journal of personality and social psychology liu and her colleagues report how they investigated the matter by conducting a series of experiments based on hypothetical and reallife scenarios involving more than participants in one experiment participants wrote a note to a fellow college student they hadnt been in touch for a while this note was emailed to the latter by the researchers who asked both the writer and recipient to indicate how much they felt the message was appreciated the results show that on average senders rated recipients appreciation at on a sevenpoint scale while the recipients themselves rated their appreciation at the team said this and other experiments revealed that people receiving messages appreciate them significantly more than the sender tends to expect further experiments suggested the degree of this mismatch is linked to how surprising the contact is when the team conducted thought experiments in which a hypothetical message or gift was expected to be given they found no difference between the senders view of how much it would be appreciated and that reported by those imagining the situation as recipients one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is that people considering reaching out do not think about how positively surprised others would feel upon being reached out to said liu but liu said questions remained while we show that people typically underestimate how much others appreciate being reached out to it remains an outstanding question how we can actually prompt people to reach out to others more she said stephen reicher a professor of social psychology at the university of st andrews who was not involved in the work said the results made sense feeling connected to others has consistently been shown to be good for our physical and mental health indeed there is a whole new literature on what is called the social cure which shows that such connections can be remarkably effective in everything to protecting against depression and maintaining cognitive abilities in the old to recovery from heart attacks he said adding that simply feeling part of a group was equally effective reicher suggested covid has underlined the need to help people connect if the pandemic has taught us anything it is that we have a pandemic of loneliness causing massive harm and we need to address it urgently as a matter of public health he said finding ways of connecting people must be a priority,2022-07,ha happened u sitting sofa toying idea sending old friend unexpected text worrying

men have a friendship problem you probably know this already if only anecdotally walk into any pub in the land and count the number of blokes sitting there drinking alone social scientists know this evidentially recent research by the mental health charity movember for example suggests that one in three men have no close friends and i know this personally in the summer of when i was planning to propose to my girlfriend naomi i realised i had no one to call on to be my best man loneliness doesnt look like me but there i was years young outgoing and always quick to buy my round and yet i had no friends and it made me feel ashamed suddenly i was that guy sitting alone in the school lunch hall i was a billy nomates this bruising realisation sent me off on a quest not only to fill a role but to answer a question what goes wrong for men like me and what can we do about it i discovered that there are three main theories you dont have friends to call your best man because of the culture in which you were raised it doesnt have anything to do with how you are naturally says niobe way a psychologist at new york university who has spent her career studying the friendships of boys and men and one of the many academics i spoke to who pointed the finger at socalled toxic masculinity in her view men struggle with friendships because they have been socialised into a man box of unhelpful gender norms that get in the way of intimacy but hang on im not toxic am i in my mind toxic masculinity referred to other men monsters like harvey weinstein sociopathic tech bros and backwater tory mps not little old me i wouldnt say youre toxic naomi reassured but you become very different when youre around guys do you know that when i began to examine how i was with the men in my life i realised that yeah maybe i was a bit weird actually i experience an irrational tightening of the body and heart at certain moments a boa constrictor of inherited awkwardness whenever a man tries to hug me i just stand there paralysed and inept like a dog being washed against its will desperately wishing for it all to be over the only time i ever tell a male friend that i even so much as even so much as like him is after seven pints or so and whenever i give a compliment to a guy its always paired with a joke it gives me distance from the emotion implied in it introducing a degree of ambiguity it raises the question what do i really feel ah yes feelings fredric rabinowitz a psychologist at the university of redlands in california who is renowned for his work with mens groups says there isnt any real education or encouragement for guys to develop a vocabulary of intimacy he recommended i get a therapist to change that i swiftly learned i had developed a number of handy tactics to avoid any sort of deep talk with the boys banter loomed large that peculiarly male way of relating that jazz of casual brutality that belligerent way of occupying space about four months into our time together my therapist told me this hometruth you have an aura that you are not open or connected there is a detachment a block you might be a laugh but you have a vibe where other people arent going to share their innermost personal stuff they get a feeling that youre not able to give it back so perhaps its no wonder you dont have any close friends sadly she was right laughter had become the only emotional display i felt comfortable with banter was everything and everything was banter the psychologists it turned out had a point something was nagging at me however male loneliness is not the contemporary problem we are often led to believe the data suggests that men have been struggling with their friendships for a long time as far back as the s and s when researchers began to look at these things if toxic masculinity is the cause of mens struggles then surely youd expect mens friendships to have improved after all its hard to argue that the sort of restrictive masculine norms the psychologists told me about havent softened since then does this not suggest that something else is going on something whisper it quietly in mens biology dr robin dunbar leading evolutionary anthropologist and the godfather of friendship research believes there is he argues that men dont become less likely to have intimate friendships they are born that way whats become very clear in the last decade dunbar told me is the completely different way the social world of men and women works the contrasting male and female social style is often characterised as facetoface versus sidebyside women tend to socialise facetoface with a strong preference for onetoone interactions based around talk and intense emotional disclosure men however tend to socialise sidebyside preferring to hang out in groups where intimacy is demonstrated by doing stuff together playing fiveaside going fishing climbing mountains and so on for men then activities are the main course of the social feast indeed in the legendary male friendships of yore achilles and patroclus butch cassidy and the sundance kid maverick and goose it was stoic shouldertoshoulder derringdo that was idolised as peak brotherhood not any more however some social scientists argue that intimacy has been redefined in the modern world to become understood as essentially a synonym for emotional disclosure thus peculiarly male forms of closeness have become invisible to us arguably making assumptions about intimacy men dont share or are even viewed as pathological take banter for example yes men can be absolutely brutal to one another yet aggression is often employed not as the opposite of intimacy but as a strategy to achieve it while laughter bares teeth this underestimates the complexity of whats going on in that moment it ignores the context the sacred space of friendship where theres a tacit agreement that we dont actually think or feel what we profess to think or feel while there is a perpetrator and a victim everyone is in on the joke when thats understood mordant banter is actually a perverse form of love it is in a real sense intimacy in action communicating both i know you and i know you trust that im not being cruel that i have permission and that we are playing a game dunbars theory was interesting because it implied that i had been looking at my bestman challenge from the wrong direction rather than focusing on improving the onetoone friendships i had with the men in my life as the psychologists had suggested maybe i should be focusing instead on rebuilding the contexts where male friendships happen on what we could do together these habitats had been razed and not replaced in my grownup life it turned out my best man quest was actually a rewilding project but sharing activities let alone organising them takes a lot of time and this is the third theory on why men have a friendship problem time is something that gets scarcer and scarcer as you exit your s your job gets more serious so does your relationship maybe kids turn up and your friends are the first thing pushed off the todo list women are also faced with this same lack of time in middle age of course yet while research shows that the social networks of both men and women wane as they age mens shrink much more why might that be its pretty simple really women put more effort into maintaining their friendships while men are apt to let their social circle wilt and coopt their partners instead as the american standup john mulaney has quipped men dont have friends they have wives whose friends have husbands men treat the women in their lives like their own personal hr department if guys were honest theyd introduce their better half at weddings with this is claudia my wife and director of people operations at geoff limited the good news is that unlike years of conditioning or the fate of our genes effort is an easy solve my mates call me the sherpa because i organise everything a friend of a

ive been friends with my best friend since we were and now were both in our mids we went through a lot of phases of life together and grew together in almost every way for almost the last decade though shes been thoroughly stuck in her life and complains about her situation even though she doesnt want to put in any effort to make it better her idea of ambition is that shes going to magically become a famous author shes a good writer but she doesnt consistently put any effort towards that project she currently works at a deadend job so ive offered to pay for some writing certifications because she never finished her university degree which is fine and at least some certifications could help her work in a field with more growth potential it also seems like every conversation we have centres around video games toys she works in a toy shop and collects them or her dogs i actually love video games too but it would be nice to seriously talk about some realworld issues too i just feel like shes never going to grow up and be the friend i know i need but im struggling to abandon this friendship because weve known each other for so long im pretty done trying to help her since it seems she doesnt want it and cant be bothered to think of her future do i let this friendship go or keep trying eleanor says a primary school in my old neighbourhood had a list of playground rules that i often think of even in adulthood be respectful eat some fruit number three was let others look after themselves its an agonising lesson to have to learn especially when youre the vessel into which someone keeps pouring their complaints but the truth of adult life is you cant make other people into what youd like them to be or even what theyd like themselves to be you cant make anyone anything you can only decide if you want to spend some of the time you get on earth with them a difficult task for any decadeslong friendship is how to preserve the relationship when the people within grow at radically different rates which to some extent is inevitable in school we all frogmarch together through the same daily schedule and the same rigid milestones but in adulthood the lines of a persons trajectory get a lot more elastic kids career divorce money all these happen at different times if at all so each one can become an island on which one half of a friendship gets marooned its hard finding ways to share your lives when you no longer share the same experiences or even the same priorities you asked whether to let this friendship go perhaps the way to find the answer is to ask whether you enjoy her company regardless of where shes at in life i hear quite a lot of frustration about how your friend lives you say shes thoroughly stuck doesnt put any effort into writing that youre worried shell never grow up but outside of an assessment about what kind of life she has whats she like as a friend is she broadly cheerful does she remember your birthday does she make time to spend with you in other words has she done anything bad by you besides slowing on the path you both hoped shed take if the answers no then perhaps the thing to do is to focus on the time you spend together instead of how she manages her life it might be that if you can populate your life with more friendships and activities that match your personal priorities it feels like less of a disappointment when she doesnt trying to change someone is a guaranteed recipe for frustration paying for her writing courses or trying to shepherd her towards her own goals risks making her decisions into your personal losses but if youre no longer in the game of helping to design her life you can sit back and focus on her company rather than her choices you might even find that theres a renaissance available for your relationship by looking at the ways youve grown to be different rather than hoping youll be more the same ask us a question do you have a conflict crossroads or dilemma

plans to ease childcare staffing ratios in nurseries in england have drawn an angry response from providers and parents who say their concerns have been ignored the government has announced it is launching a consultation on ways to reduce childcare costs for parents most notably by changing stafftochild ratios so that each adult can look after five twoyearolds instead of four as currently permitted it says the move could reduce costs by up to or a week for a family paying a week for care for a twoyearold if providers adopt the changes and pass on all the savings however the figures have been questioned by the charity pregnant then screwed which described them as nonsense purnima tanuku the chief executive of the national day nurseries association ndna said from when this was first mooted the sector has been saying that altering ratios for twoyearolds from to wont make any meaningful difference to the cost of childcare for providers or parents that can only come from the government paying the full rate for funded childcare places for children under five many children are coming into early years settings with additional needs having been impacted by covid restrictions more children are struggling with language acquisition and with their personal social and emotional development as a result this is why now is not the time to be giving young children less support the proposed new ratio would bring england in line with scotland but tanuku said the early years framework in scotland was very different in terms of qualification levels staff training and support from their regulators a study in commissioned by the government when it was considering the policy concluded that allowing staff members to look after more children would lead to a reduction in quality and that there was little evidence that high fees were a result of regulatory requirements the government has reprised the policy as part of efforts to tackle the cost of living crisis neil leitch the ceo of the early years alliance said it is beyond frustrating that the government is wasting its time consulting on relaxing ratios rather than just admitting that if we want to have affordable quality sustainable care and early education in this country we need to invest substantially more into the sector than we are doing at the moment if the government wants to take lessons from other countries maybe it should look at how much they invest in early years providers and how they respect and value the workforce watering down early years standards at a time when children need more support than ever is not and never will be the answer joeli brearley the founder of pregnant then screwed said research by the charity and alliance found that only of nurseries and preschools would lower fees for parents mainly because most would not relax ratios and even when they did the average would be about a week she said were furious that after months and months of talking to the government showing them data that for twothirds of families childcare costs the same or more than their rent or mortgage and is pushing parents into poverty children into poverty theyve come up with a proposal to change ratios that wont reduce costs for parents but will just reduce quality the government also announced plans to boost childminder numbers by granting them greater flexibility and reducing inspections and it has launched a m campaign to encourage greater takeup of the ayear taxfree childcare scheme and the universal credit childcare offer the education secretary nadhim zahawi said every child deserves a great start in life and that means giving families the support they need childcare is an integral part of our economy and these reforms prove again that this government is on the side of working families im hugely grateful to the thousands of dedicated early years professionals who provide daily care and education to our youngest children which is why i am determined to support them

asian parenting has become a hot topic of public conversation lately in a sign of their growing maturity and confidence secondgeneration asian migrants in australia and other countries have become more comfortable sharing stories of their complex relationships with their tiger parents in social media forums such as subtle asian traits and its numerous spinoffs young people express resentment acceptance and other reflections on the way they were raised but the reckoning is not limited to social media recent films such as disney and pixars turning red and dan kwan and daniel scheinerts everything everywhere all at once also explore intergenerational relationships within asian migrant families depicting the burden of expectations and childrens attempts to meet defy or negotiate them marvel star simu liu chang shi and the legend of the ten rings goes further in his new memoir we were dreamers by tracing extreme tiger parenting he experienced to deprivation and trauma experienced in his chinese parents own lives in his book the canadian actor says he felt that his parents wanted to rid my life of joy or happiness like many children of asian migrants liu describes suffering under the weight of what he describes as impossible expectations to be the star child the studious academic the obedient son he was belittled and physically punished he writes for every perceived failing homework harvard and high expectations weve been conducting research with young asian australians aged between and for the last eight years and this tension between resentment understanding and acceptance marks the relationships that many children of asian migrants have with their parents the asian tiger parenting stereotype according to our research is real all our research participants more than in total said that their parents had extremely high expectations of them almost all spent hundreds of hours completing extra homework tasks set by their parents and attending private tutoring centres often multiple times a week throughout their schooling years many echoed lius sentiments when he described the true purpose of childhood getting into harvard many of our interviewees expressed frustration at their parents narrow focus on educational achievement to the exclusion of all else rebecca a recent university graduate was scathing of her parents obsession with education her failure to achieve a place at a top selective school was a source of shame for the whole family she said others reflected on their enormous study loads in the leadup to the selective schools admissions test some saying they worked harder when they were only years old than at any other time in their lives linda said her adolescent depression was largely caused by her parents unrealistic expectations and to boot culturally people from china dont really know what depression is this meant it was almost impossible for her to talk with her parents about what she was going through others were resentful at not having the freedom to choose their own subjects or university courses they felt forced into safe or prestigious fields such as medicine law or engineering having their passion for the arts and other useless subjects crushed trades and services were not even on the radar reckoning with parents past in we were dreamers liu explores the personal histories of his parents who survived some of the worst excesses of th century china to explain their extreme outlook on life like liu many of our participants also understood why their parents adopted such harsh parenting practices because they knew about the deprivations they had suffered and their continued struggles as migrants in australia those in our study with families from china sometimes mentioned the cultural revolution and their parents sadness at being denied educational and other opportunities vietnamese australians talked about the impact of the war and subsequent exodus on their parents education and livelihoods they recognised that their parents did not have the opportunity to realise their potential in australia our participants could see the discrimination their parents often endured and the sacrifices they had made to build new lives they understood that their parents obsession with study and good grades was ultimately an attempt to build a secure future for their children in an unequal society they are acutely aware of the opportunities open to them that their parents did not enjoy sally recalled how hearing about her parents migration was a way to remind me you have no reason to fail in your life implicit in this is an ultimatum that success is the only option reflecting on their upbringing some of our participants expressed gratitude at the toughlove parenting they endured saying it did indeed open up pathways to professional success as painful as it might have been when they were younger they were now enjoying the fruits of that hard work as young professionals but some found it harder to reconcile with the way they were raised they found that understanding their parents context did not mean acceptance of their behaviour they still resent the unrelenting burden of their parents expectations and the lack of emotional support within their families the legacy of their parents migration dwarfed their own challenges as one participant said the paradox these young people are caught in a paradox while they understand their parents struggles they simultaneously feel resentment that their own hardships are invalidated or overlooked they also feel guilt for complaining about these troubles in the face of their parents hardships this generation of asian heritage people raised in the west experience an unresolved and perhaps unresolvable tension between understanding and acceptance understanding their parents context and motives can help young people see their parents as holistic human beings rather than just tyrannical slave drivers but it still may not lead to acceptance of their harsh parenting the profound and sometimes unfathomable differences in the life experiences of first and secondgeneration migrants can create limits to mutual empathy as liu writes i know that my father was not evil and i know that he didnt deliberately intend to inflict deep emotional scars it must have been difficult empathising with a child who he wholeheartedly believed had a far easier life than he did i didnt really know what it was like to grow up constantly hungry because there wasnt enough food or to have to uproot your entire life to travel halfway around the world to start from the bottom all over again my biggest concern was figuring out why i wasnt more popular at school liu now enjoys a happier relationship with his parents though one cant help but wonder if this was enabled by his mammoth professional success in hollywood as such his story offers glimpses of how first and secondgeneration migrants may be able to successfully coexist with each other despite unresolved tensions being able to live with that lack of resolution and lack of absolute acceptance is perhaps an important aspect of any family relationship there might not be a hollywood ending but the continual journey towards mutual understanding might be even more fulfilling,2022-07,asian parenting ha become hot topic public conversation lately sign growing maturity

i used to have quite a lot of friends when i was younger but for some reason i find friendships very difficult these days i feel let down constantly i feel im always there for other people and inquire about their lives but never get anything in return i have noticed that if i do not ask them questions the conversation falls silent my father for example is elderly but still active whenever i am with him we only have a nice time when i enquire after him i saw a good friend of ours last week and told her that my partner and i are going through difficult times she put her arm around me but didnt say or ask anything about it i was stunned when she was widowed we spent endless hours talking about her situation and other things going on in her life i would not dare compare the death of ones partner with problems in a relationship but i never really talk about me to her precisely because she has lost her husband and felt most of my issues were trivial but i just do not understand why there was no reaction whatsoever when i for once opened up about myself after my mother died unexpectedly some years ago i was so disappointed in people i considered good friends i know everyone has their issues and i perfectly understand the world does not revolve around me but this seems incomprehensible i know its my problem and i have been told my expectations are too high i just long for a glimmer of interest from anyone when i do tell people things not just negative things as i barely talk about those there is never any followup i feel pathetic about all of this but also really hurt youre not pathetic you gave me lots of examples of friends letting you down or not seeming to take an interest in you and it all sounds very tough but to try to find a solution for you i want to dial back to when things changed from being younger and having lots of friends to when it got to be more difficult i wondered and i may be barking up the wrong tree here if it centres around your mothers death maybe you felt she was the only one who listened to you most people can identify with some of what you say we all have friends who can be selfcentred and not ask questions there is rarely a perfectly balanced friendship we often get back from different people to whom weve given however given this is now happening with all your friends i wonder if it might be worth looking at something thats changed in you i consulted psychotherapist arabella russell bacpcouk who wondered if you felt really seen and heard as a child she says the extent of your hurt seems to run so deep so we wondered if perhaps finding solace solely from friends was a bigger ask than they can fulfil at the moment sometimes this chasm created in childhood only starts to be felt in adulthood and sometimes this can happen after a significant loss this is why i wondered when it started and if perhaps your mother fulfilled a need that now nobody does i totally get said russell why your friendships seem so disappointing but maybe youre trying to fill a void from way back with your friends this is an impossible ask and can only lead to disappointment our friends should be interested in us and our stuff should be important to them but we also have to manage our own emotions explained russell friends should provide something but not everything for us the resentment i see in you is a secondary emotion i think the primary one is really sadness who told you your expectations were too high could you go back and ask them to elucidate you know what would be a brave thing to do ask your most trusted friend suggested russel how do you experience me can i feel hard to look after sometimes what does it feel like when youre trying to help me it may be that your friends sense their help is not really reaching you and arent sure what to do now do you have a friend from the time before when you found friendships easier and could you ask them if they feel something has changed in you its always

the question i am writing on behalf of myself and my sister we are thirdgeneration immigrants both our grandparents being italian and settling in london we have been raised in a britishitalian household sharing values from both but never feeling as if we fit into either identity being removed by two generations from our grandparents and not speaking italian makes us feel as if we are not italian and that we are removed from this community on the other hand we dont feel english resulting in a lack of national and cultural identity thus we feel a loneliness which is only furthered by us being removed from other family members who perhaps experience the same problem although we have tried reaching out to italian communities often the language barrier makes us feel even more isolated and there seems to be a lack of conversation surrounding the experience of being thirdgeneration immigrants making us doubt that we can even make it part of our italian identity it feels as if the only thing that gives validity to this identity is our mother who refuses to engage with this subject and therefore this feeling is one that is external and will unfortunately end with her so i guess our question is what can we do to end this feeling of isolation and lack of identity philippas answer the physical feeling of being a foreign body in both lands and carrying culture norms and mores from both is difficult to navigate so it is not surprising you have some feelings of disconnection it struck me that your mother wont engage with you and your sister on this subject her parents may have been in the second world war they may have lost property people and livelihoods so i imagine there is pain and trauma back there and im wondering whether this has been passed down to you and your sister via your mother it may be that to talk about italy as an italian to talk to you in italian to share with you what it feels like to her to be italian while having to be in britain is too painful to think about there is some mystery there and maybe your mother cant explain it but only feel it it could be that she has passed down this feeling of not belonging to you and it may seem to her that the best way of curing it is to deny it meaning you and your sister are pushed away when you try to go there my fantasy is that she wants you to be british women so that you dont get this feeling of being in two cultures while not belonging to either of them but if this was her plan it has not worked im only guessing but i feel there is a sense of disconnect in your mother around identity and belonging and this has unintentionally been passed to you im sorry she did not speak italian to you when you were babies or that your grandparents didnt it would have helped i think to have the two languages when i have worked with secondgeneration immigrants they say they feel like you neither one thing nor the other in this country they are seen as being from the country their parents came from but when they go back to the land of their parents they are called british without feeling that they are either transgenerational or intergenerational trauma is when the experiences of parents affect the development of children and even grandchildren researchers dont completely understand this type of trauma but have noted it changes not only the way parents are with their children but how certain genes are expressed in future generations this may explain further why you and your sister feel anchorless and as though you do not belong anywhere but what practical steps can you take learning italian may help especially if you watch italian films read italian books and get into the rhythm of the language and really embody it i think it will bring you closer to the culture even if you never get fluent this is not an easy task but you can do it together and then youll have company a spanishbritish friend told me that she calls herself a londoner as she feels such an identity embraces so many cultures you are italianbritish britishitalian but i think you have been pushed away a little from the italian not only because of possible trauma in previous generations but perhaps because your mother was somehow made to feel ashamed of being an immigrant i think people should be proud of taking the bold step to emigrate but it could be a reason why she seems to not want to engage about being an italian in britain you belong here on this earth the world is your home but i understand you want to feel more at home what you and your sister feel is typical so you are having a very normal human response to the situation book recommendation the bridge dialogues across cultures edited by talia levine baryoseph gestalt press,2022-08,question writing behalf sister

since having my son i have thought often about singleparent families i dont know how you cope is a common refrain that you hear from coupledup parents but im not about to patronise any of you you cope because you have to because you love your child or children and they need you i understand that i saw my mother do it and have single parents in my extended family and friendship groups what ive been trying to think about is more physical than that you see my back hurts it hurts from lifting the baby and from walking him up and down every night while singing him maudlin irish folk songs and i think from the fact that as im sleeping i unconsciously twist my head towards him so i can better hear his fluttering breaths but when my back hurts too much i pass the baby to my husband and he starts walking him up and down and i will go into another room and sometimes pour a glass of wine its the absence of that small moment of respite that sticks with me the grinding physical toll of caring for a child alone even when it hurts even when your bones seem to ache we dont give single parents much credit in the uk the government has actively punished them penalising them and their children financially in ways both craven and heartless reading accounts of how single mothers are struggling in the cost of living crisis brought me to tears last month it seems to me painfully unfair that as well as facing all the physical emotional and financial pressures that come from looking after children alone single mothers continue to be heavily stigmatised in ways that are both classist and misogynist assumed to be young unemployed feckless uneducated hyperfertile despite the data showing otherwise then theres the more subtle social exclusion as couples tend to only socialise with their own i think hope that my generation is less prone to this particular form of tedious insecure ostracism as different lifestyles become more common and many more women especially are actively choosing single motherhood but the notion of the nuclear family still holds an awful lot of sway sophie heawood wrote beautifully in this paper about how it feels to live outside that narrative how

realities of single parenting with katherine ryans standup and series the duchess and diane morgans character in motherland acting as important correctives while anna hrmls cartoons are enlightening and laughoutloud funny but we still need more and more diverse depictions the relationship between a child and their single parent can be very special and this is something we rarely see i have spoken to other adult children of single parents and they often reflect on the intimacy and closeness they feel their childhood has given them seeing your parent as a flawed and sometimes vulnerable adult can be its own burden as can the codependency of such a relationship but at the same time it can give you a far more nuanced understanding of your parent and their inner emotional life i have hardly seen this specialness depicted anywhere i suppose because it kicks so hard against the dominant notion that a child is always better off with two parents at home and that the children of single parents are deprived by default to be raised by a lone parent can be a joy and a privilege it is true that half of singleparent families live in relative poverty and this year is going to see more and more single parents struggling to keep their children warm and fed it is important to highlight that and push for better government support for single parents but it is also crucial to say to single parents that we see them we support them and we recognise the work they do every day whats working my dad came to visit and gave me some crucial downtime by taking the boy out in his pram or walking the songlines as he calls it in tribute to bruce chatwins book on indigenous australian song and its connections to nomadic travel he says that babies are most relaxed when in perpetual movement and it does seem to be working i must get out more what isnt cars however dont seem to have the same effect weve spent yet another taxi ride with the boy screaming in his car seat my nerves shot to shreds

nearly of parents who are supposed to contribute towards the upkeep of their children through the governmentrun child maintenance system are failing to make any payments most parents owing maintenance arrange their own payments but the child maintenance service cms created a scheme called collect and pay which calculates how much maintenance is due and takes in the funds it is often used by lowincome parents who struggle to make payments among the nonresident parents who use the scheme paid no maintenance in the three months to march the highest figure since mid and a marked rise since failed to pay maintenance in the quarter to june only percent of nonresident parents those living away from their children who use collect amp pay made more than of the payment they owed in the first quarter of down from a year earlier victoria benson chief executive of singleparents charity gingerbread said research shows that of singleparent families living in poverty and not receiving child maintenance would be able to escape the poverty trap if they were paid the money theyre owed parents have a legal and moral duty to contribute to their childs upbringing whether they live with them or not and where this money isnt paid willingly the cms needs to step in child maintenance simply cannot be seen as optional the cms needs to use its powers to stamp out persistent nonpayment and ensure that no child experiences hardship or poverty because their nonresident parent wont support them financially its about time this government and the department for work and pensions dwp took the issue of unpaid maintenance seriously its shameful that so many children are forced to live in poverty as a result of a lax child maintenance service and a disinterested government department the public accounts committee of mps recently slammed the dwp which runs the cms for achieving no more for children of separated families than under the previous discredited child support agency collect and pay performance has improved since but has slipped sharply since the height of the pandemic the fall in universal credit claims has reduced the number of payments that can be automatically deducted from benefit payments ensuring they are paid the withdrawal of the weekly universal credit uplift has also had an effect the dwps commentary on the figures states withdrawing the uplift led to an increase in the number of uc claimants who were due to pay via deduction from benefit not having enough benefit remaining within the uc deduction cap to allow a child maintenance deduction to be taken up to of a universal credit claimants standard benefit payment can be deducted with other debts taking priority over child maintenance payments universal credit deductions have been criticised for driving claimants further into poverty the public accounts committee report warned that the dwps ability to collect child maintenance is limited by the affordability of payments and that the system risks creating a poverty trap for some parents who owe money a dwp spokesperson said child maintenance is an essential source of income for many loneparent families helping to lift children out of poverty on average each year through continuous enhancements to its processes and powers the child maintenance service got a record bn to children of separated parents last year child maintenance is calculated so it is reasonable and affordable according to a paying parents income with the very lowest earners protected by a flat rate of per week giving children the best start in life is the

on tuesday the new south wales education minister sarah mitchell said lifting the school starting age to the year a child turns six would reduce large age gaps and put students on a more equal footing it follows an announcement in june that nsw and victoria would overhaul the early education sector effectively adding an extra year four experts explain the advantages and challenges of such changes affordability remains a key barrier the nsw governments proposal to lift the school starting age to the year a child turns six has potential to benefit children but it will only work if the longstanding workforce crisis exacerbated by covid is addressed i appreciate the intent to reduce the discrepancy in ages and abilities of children when they start school this is an incredible challenge for kindergarten teachers particularly when we know that families send their children to school before they are ready because school is more affordable than childcare and we know this is a problem because one in five children are starting school developmentally vulnerable children effectively attending for an additional year the year they turn five will only benefit if the service they are attending is providing quality early learning programs the workforce crisis poses a significant threat to the quality of early education enrolments in early childhood teacher education course are declining and many early teachers choose to leave early childhood to work in a school where they can earn up to more a year the sector already needs an extra early childhood teachers by if services are to meet regulatory requirements the proposal has the potential to increase demand but from where the quality early childhood teacher workforce will come remains unclear we need to think carefully about what such a proposal will mean for children in families experiencing disadvantage we know that the children who stand to benefit most from attending a quality early education service are also the least likely to attend even if they are enrolled affordability remains a key barrier the nsw initiatives to improve childrens access to early education are welcome but as these polices are rolled out the state government will need to ensure that not only are more children attending early learning services but that the quality of these services is of the standard children need and deserve assoc prof marianne fenech is program director for early education at the university of sydney and chair of the australian early childhood teacher education network parents must have the opportunity to decide i have three children who are vastly different in terms of their learning styles skills and interests my eldest knew her alphabet at months old and was reading short picture books at four and four years on shes flourishing as one of the top students in her grade despite being born one day short of the cutoff holding her back i believe would have been detrimental to her potential by contrast my son will start school unable to identify more than a handful of letters despite the extensive efforts of both his parents and the staff at his preschool i believe parents must have the opportunity to decide for themselves within reason the path that is right for their child of course this all depends on what the governments plan will actually look like for families because at present the details are far from clear while i understand the merits of raising the starting school age so more children are on an even footing when they begin the reality is that no matter how they begin the educational experiences of our children will never be equal the difference in funding between public schools and private schools the mass tutoring uptake by some families and the fact that some teachers are burntout and some families due to work commitments or languagecultural barriers cant help their kids with homework will entrench inevitable differences if the government plans to fund this program in its entirety then its a conversation im willing to have but having a child starting school is liberating for parents who are juggling care and work duties often with workplaces who are not as progressive as they could be in terms of flexible working arrangements the cost of childcare which hits families hard without the added burdens of inflation and rising interest rates must be addressed if we are planning on keeping our kids away from school another year i have always firmly believed that the best place for the child is their family or their village but life is less and less like a village these days and the fact that it is mostly disadvantaged families who send their kids to school before theyre ready because it saves childcare costs and frees parents up to work tells us that are there more pressing matters the state ought to address to even out our childrens lives a lack of equality has a ripple effect sarah ayoub is a journalist academic and author of books for young adults and children this could reduce the wide age ranges in the classroom nsw students have some of the highest rates of delayed entrants in the world our research suggests of students start school in the year after they are eligible and for those parents who have a choice in the matter who have children born between january and july are delayed as a consequence children range in ages from four and a half to six in the first year of school children starting school at younger ages have lower levels of school readiness than older children and more socioeconomically advantaged parents are more likely to choose to delay thus widening gaps in school readiness by socioeconomic status will raising the school age reduce these gaps for many parents having older children may mean that they are more likely to send their child to school on time if the nsw government also reduces the opportunity to delay school start from between january and july to say january and april as in victoria this could reduce the wide age ranges in the classroom ben edwards is associate professor of child and youth development at the australian national university early childhood education in nsw works as an unequaliser moving the school starting age to the year a child turns six is a great improvement to the situation in nsw but only if the government will keep its early promise to provide universal free public early childhood education kindergarten to all fiveyearolds lifting the school starting age is part of much larger effort to improve lives of children in nsw research examining the benefits of starting formal schooling earlier is not consistentearly childhood education in nsw works as an unequaliser because it gives children from affluent and disadvantaged families very different conditions if the nsw government goes about these changes the right way they may act as muchneeded improvements in educational equity i would suggest the following three things be important in putting these reforms into practice first early childhood education including primary school needs to be designed in terms of a childs rights play wellbeing and wholechild development should be the key principles second every fiveyearold should have the right to attend a highquality public preschool it should be the governments responsibility to make sure this right is protected and that welleducated teachers and educators are working in every school third the first years of primary school should be redesigned so that they provide a seamless playbased transition from early childhood education this design should consider childrens individual differences focus on learning and wellbeing and avoid unnecessary assessments and tests most importantly lifting the school starting age to six should not mean that the first years of primary school become a time to catch up on academic content children were supposed to learn before this proposal by the nsw government is a real

cheaper childcare who wouldnt want that after fee increases of over in the last eight years it is clearly very much needed nods of approval all around as the albanese government ushers in a new bill promising cheaper childcare this week arent we lucky to now have a government that understands the importance of accessible lowcost quality education and care that made it a priority both in their election campaign and in their legislative program prioritising the education and care of our youngest citizens is so very very right so cheaper childcare yay but cheaper for whom in the financial year the australian government spent bn on early education and care the states and territories spent another bn that works out at about per child or bn of taxpayers money every year to deliver cheaper childcare even more money must be poured in another bn a year what if instead of just pouring more money into a system that is clearly incapable of delivering at a reasonable cost we radically redesigned that funding system after all anthony albanese isnt the only prime minister who has promised to cut the cost of care for families morrison did before him his government delivered the childcare subsidy system we currently have you know the one that failed to deliver cheap enough childcare so what would a radical redesign look like how about we go for a redesign where our teachers and educators get wages commensurate with their skills and importance where we dont duplicate funding systems by the states and territories and the commonwealth where families dont have to sell their firstborn child to afford care and where money isnt siphoned off by the spivs and corporations sucking from the government funding teat would that be too much to ask funding services rather than the families that use them direct funding would give governments a powerful lever to control what those services charge families and wait isnt there a model a bit like that for older children i think they are called schools make it illegal to make a profit from government funding too radical no school can receive federal education funding unless they are notforprofit what about private schools you ask why do you think private schools have such lavish grounds and facilities their surpluses must be reinvested back into their school the government buys the premises education and care is delivered from and becomes the landlord developers and landlords make a motza out of renting premises to services under inflated lucrative leases with guaranteed rent increases above market rates after all it is governments who own the premises that education for older children is delivered from just one level of government is responsible for funding all of education and care we currently have a crazy mishmash of systems where states fund services called preschools with money they get from the federal government while the commonwealth funds the families who use education and care services with other names why because under our constitution states and territories are responsible for the delivery of education leaving the commonwealth responsible for the care part duplicating the school system isnt the only way to deliver costeffective early education and care but there are strong precedents there for doing almost everything that needs to be done to reduce the cost of the system to our country the albanese government has announced simultaneous productivity commission and accc inquiries to accompany their funding increase but what we need is a government with the courage to go for a massive redesign rather than fiddle around the edges and do more reviews regarded as one of the best education systems in the world the national government in finland sets fees and then funds each local government to ensure there is enough early education and care for every child in their area they get to decide how it is delivered directly by them by notforprofit organisations or by private companies willing to deliver for the set fees we could do worse than emulate this there is no point in governments repeatedly announcing they will increase the subsidies for families cheaper childcare for families always comes at a cost to us as a country but i suppose that doesnt matter to the developers the landlords the stock exchange investors and the chain owners who rub their hands again at the even bigger pot of money they get to snuffle at lisa bryant is an advocate for education and care in australia and a consultant to education and care services,2022-09,cheaper childcare wouldnt

tens of thousands of lowincome families in england have to pay to return to work after having children because childcare provision discourages work according to a report the institute for public policy research ippr has called for a governmentfunded universal preschool childcare starting immediately after parental leave to replace an incomplete patchwork of childcare provision the move would improve tax receipts upskill the workforce and improve childhood outcomes argues the ippr in a damning report examining current childcare provision the ippr said englands childcare market is on the brink of collapse as government funding for free available hours fails to meet spiralling costs for providers the report states that children in lowincome households receive worse care than those in wealthier households workers leave the workforce because of the gap in childcare funding after the end of parental leave upfront childcare costs for parents on universal credit even if later reimbursed stop lowearners returning to work a lack of affordable wraparound care is stretching family budgets to breaking point the uk has the second highest childcare costs in the developed world as fees have risen by an estimated a year and have almost doubled for parents with a child under two since according to tuc research the ippr has found that low earners face staggeringly high effective tax rates of up to if they work more than hours a week as they pay income tax universal credit tapers and childcare costs mount this would mean that an administrator earning an hour with a partner earning a similar amount would effectively pay for every hour they worked over hours the current childcare system has now created an environment which disincentives parents from work said henry parkes ippr senior economist and the reports coauthor you should not be worse off from working more the system needs change englands childcare market has changed fundamentally in the past decade according to the ippr report the number of statemaintained providers which have historically provided the highest quality care and disproportionately served disadvantaged children has shrunk while forprofit provision has expanded particularly in private equity owned nursery chains according to the report this has contributed to widening gaps in access and quality by childrens socioeconomic background the ippr is calling for a childcare guarantee of hours of free childcare for all preschool age children for weeks a year an extension of the free hours for three and fouryearolds to cover school holidays an expansion of wraparound care and a new funding settlement for providers the ippr estimates that making the current hour offer available to some twoyearolds universal would cost an estimated bn a year while a universal hour offer would cost bn or bn for week coverage in the government spent bn on street lighting rachel statham coauthor of the report said that while there was public support for universal childcare parents plight was being ignored by the government were seeing a litany of promised tax cuts but no serious investment in families that would immediately help people struggling with their bills but it is also an investment in children the childcare workforce and in parents longerterm careers fight to save councilrun nurseries a group of west london parents have started a campaign including a petition and a rally outside uxbridge civic centre on thursday evening after hillingdon council said it intends to close all three councilrun nurseries permanently in december parents in the save hillingdon nurseries group argue that private nurseries in the area are between and more expensive than councilrun nurseries and will leave many parents with no choice but to stop working they also argue that some parents with children who have special educational needs which were met in the council nurseries have been told that their child cannot have a place in local private nurseries because of their requirements orest bakhovski from the group said the council had made the decision under special urgency rules which meant it was fasttracked with no scrutiny or consultation with parents and the local community for a lot of people these nurseries are a lifeline and mean both parents can work he said we think no one has really tried to keep these nurseries alive and thats because its not a statutory service as far as the council is concerned they can wind the services down relatively easily and sell the land off hillingdon council said the three centres cost the boroughs council tax payers more than a year in subsidy and represented only of the capacity in hillingdon ian edwards leader of hillingdon council said with increasing inflation rates the

claire kenyon prides herself on offering flexible affordable playcentred childcare at her chichester nursery but fears she may soon be forced to close her doors busy lizzies which sits on a council estate and serves mostly deprived families is now racking up losses of about per year only of its children are from feepaying households with the rest funded solely by the governments free termtime childcare offer either hours per week for all three and fouryearolds in england or hours for working parents of children in this age group the nursery loses an hour for each funded child the biggest issue for us is the huge jumps in minimum wage over the past few years says kenyon the nurserys manager and coowner soaring energy bills driven by russias invasion of ukraine have compounded matters the government is due to announce the details of a bailout package for businesses on wednesday part of liz trusss bn support scheme to cap energy bills and it cannot come soon enough every time the minimum wage goes up so do our outgoings because the government funding doesnt match these wage rises while many other nurseries have reacted to the wages bill by charging for extras such as lunch or activities kenyon says this is not an option as children of lowincome parents would stay at home without significant state support of the kind promised by truss she cannot predict how long she will be able to keep going well simply have to close kenyon says we already operate with the help of a very expensive short term loan to pay staff this summer ofsted data showed that between april and march there was a net overall decrease of childcare providers in england the largest decline in six years kirsty lester who owns two nurseries in dorset is also pondering whether to quit her job of nearly three decades in years i have never been so low and ready to walk away from a vocation i have loved the yearold says the rising costs particularly energy and the new living wage are squeezing us to the brink the pandemic has wiped out all my reserves so cashflow is now a problem for the first time in years like millions of other small and mediumsized businesses childcare providers are caught in a perfect storm of rising overheads inconsistent demand and a steadily worsening labour shortage lester says she has had no choice but to put up prices to survive a decision feeding into inflation running at nationally after paying betterthanaverage local wages for years a series of national minimum wage increases made it necessary to cut staffing and pay her supervisors more the pandemic lester says has compounded a recruitment crisis in nurseries that has been brewing for years with few young people applying now and apprentices not turning up im working hour weeks to cover the staffing shortfall were all shattered many people have left the sector since covid aldi are advertising jobs paying an hour and as the number of children with special needs is rising the work environment is much more stressful than it used to be lester is struggling to come to terms with the reality that many parents today simply cannot afford the kind of childcare she and many others want to offer in march almost half of working mothers responding to a major survey said they were considering leaving their jobs while were already working fewer hours because childcare fees were unaffordable the press is full of parents complaining about rising childcare costs but parents receive more help now than at any other time lester says we providers are underfunded feel unappreciated and treated like babysitters the system is broken neil leitch the chief executive of the early years alliance eya charity which represents earlyyears settings and operates on a notforprofit basis in mostly disadvantaged communities says mass closures are on the horizon an october eya survey of nurseries preschools and childminding settings in england revealed that one in six earlyyears settings believed staff shortages would probably force their setting to close permanently within a year between march and march earlyyears providers in england shut up shop this time three years ago we operated settings but had to close because we dont charge for lunches and play the games many providers have to play to stay afloat leitch says staff are leaving the sector in droves and parents cannot continue shouldering rising fees there is he said a national recruitment and retention crisis driven by gross underfunding and unaffordable wages abi mills a selfemployed childminder from lancaster has been looking after preschool children in her home for years the yearold is one of several childminders who told the guardian that rising energy costs might force them to quit despite the governments energy price guarantee our fuel bills are already a month and i worry about how ill keep the house warm for the minded kids she says you cant tell a baby to wear extra jumpers mills who made profits of last tax year and says she takes home less than minimum wage knows that higher overheads will affect the variety of activities she can offer i recently put my fees up to an hour but ill have less spare money for trips to soft play parks ill do anything i can to carry on but i cant put my fees up again i may need to look for different work outside the house so i wont need to heat our home as much and have a more secure job amid fears that a worsening cost of living crisis may make it impossible for many parents to continue paying for some of the most expensive childcare in the world the government has launched a consultation on whether changing stafftochild ratios could bring down childcare costs and make struggling earlyyears businesses viable again a plan that has angered parents and providers however tom filer who owns six nurseries in somerset and north somerset favours more relaxed staff ratios we are now on the top end of what parents can pay some have had to reduce hours or take their children out im in favour of the irish model with better government funding and more relaxed ratios theres no evidence that countries like ireland scotland or germany with less strict ratios have a poorer quality of care caroline elsemman one of two directors at little jungle nursery in peckham london is not against relaxed ratios but believes more skilled earlyyears workers are needed numbers of adequately qualified staff in the uk have dwindled because of brexit the yearold says we used to recruit from abroad france portugal spain where earlyyears staff are wellqualified and have strong family values brexit has cut off this tap of skilled workers just relaxing the ratios wont necessarily bring the costs down the better skilled staff you have the fewer you need but we cant even fill all our vacancies despite spending thousands per month on recruitment and having raised our wages substantially over the past year,2022-09,claire kenyon pride offering

i desperately need help with a very dear friend of mine who is always late and hard to pin down weve been friends for more than years she is kind and funny in some ways she is the friend with whom i feel i can be most myself we dont live far from each other but trying to meet up is hell she is vague and flaky with making plans she is perpetually late every time we suggest a time to meet she asks to meet later then still turns up late with no apology she sometimes messages me and suggests things but rarely makes the arrangements im starting to loathe the vague texts and waiting for her to reply or show up i feel the frustration and resentment in me growing i wonder if she just doesnt care about meeting up as much as i do and if i should just take the hint but when we do meet we have a great time she has a number of chronic health conditions and has suffered from depression i try to be accommodating travelling to her for example and understanding if she isnt feeling well i dont feel i can say this has been really annoying me for years can you make more effort i dont know how to raise this without being rude i understand the fatigue you feel when one person in the friendship is so much more proactive it can make you wonder if its just your energy that keeps the friendship going and what would happen if you stopped but what ive learnt is some people are just crap at arrangements and fear rejection so dont suggest things this is more common than you may think i asked psychoanalytic psychotherapist poul rohleder why someone may be consistently late it could be about not wanting to be there for whatever reason that something is being avoided or it could be an underlying anxiety and being late is about shortening the time it could be a passiveaggressive act or that the person being late doesnt think theyre worthy of the other persons time theres a tendency to think that the person being late is the one in control but actually i think people who are more secure and confident arent generally late because they value their own time and thus other peoples your friend has an added layer of health issues so we wondered how much that impacted what im really interested in said dr rohleder is why you cant talk to her about it you should be able to confront someone in a good friendship but if something else is going on addressing the lateness could be opening a pandoras box has something happened in your friendship thats difficult to talk about talking to her and asking her point of view so its not a damnation of her but an enquiry might give you really useful intel how differently would you feel if you found out for example that she was trying the best she could until you feel able to do that here are some practical ideas why not just ring her for a chat instead of making an appointment to chat be more decisive and say shall i come round on thursday let me know by tuesday night and if youve arranged to meet somewhere say something like ill wait x minutes for you but then ill have to go or something like that so you feel less buffeted about by her friendships are rarely symmetrical with one person often being better at one thing than another

labour has warned that families with young children face another potential income squeeze this autumn after data suggested the cost of afterschool clubs had risen oneandahalf times faster than consumer inflation since citing analysis that says families using afterschool provision five days a week are spending a year more than in labour called for ministers to do more to address what it said was another significant cost of living pressure the average family using fivedayaweek afterschool provision now spends more money on this than on their weekly food shop the party said using research by the coram childrens charity labour said families in england using allweek afterschool provision for a week academic year were paying an average of more than the cost of the sum was the party said of the level contrasting this with consumer price inflation over the same period which amounted to labour said the increased costs coupled with higher prices for food and other essentials and for energy meant some parents could find it harder to work while children would miss out on activities and time with friends it said this was particularly worrying in combination with the cost of school

love is blind goes the old saying whereas friendship closes its eyes the problem with closing our eyes however is that at some point we open them and what happens when we take in the full and perhaps less than flattering picture of our dearest friends thats the premise of martin mcdonaghs bleak comedy the banshees of inisherin which has wowed critics and set audiences wondering one day during the irish civil war on the beautiful though grindingly uneventful island of inisherin pdraic colin farrell goes to pick up his best friend colm brendan gleeson for their daily pint in the local pub but colm doesnt want to go with pdraic in a crude earlyth century version of airing or ghosting colm speaks to him only to say that he no longer wants to speak to him what follows is a rather desolate if amusing study of male friendship its habits limits and lack of mutual understanding or emotional intimacy although the films setting is a harshly rural outpost of ireland in counsellor and psychotherapist adrian wilsonsmith says that he regularly encounters similar attitudes in his male clients in the uk in having a circle of good friends is known to increase life expectancy and improve mental health yet wilsonsmith says that he sees a lot of men over who see no need for real friendships drawing on aristotles classification of friendship he divides nonsexual relationships into three distinct categories functional partying and enduring there are a lot of men having functional relationships with other men i know this guy because he can help me out with my business idea or partying these are the guys that i go out with for a drink or a line of coke but enduring friendships of the kind seen in many femaletofemale friendships are not something that most men over see any need to have friendship it seems is yet another field of life in which women appear to be outperforming men according to richard reevess new book of boys and men men are struggling by comparison with women in almost all endeavours except earning more money and running the world if all this seems like an anachronistically gendered view of human relations there is a wealth of behavioural studies almost all focused on heteronormative subjects that show that women make and maintain friendships in markedly different ways to men women for example are more inclined to have best friends and men are more likely to socialise in groups though anyone whos witnessed a fullblown hen party may want to challenge that particular finding what research unambiguously shows is that as wilsonsmith puts it most heterosexual men look to their partners to do their social organising for them jed novick a yearold lecturer is a long way from the archetype of the repressed male he dresses flamboyantly for example and is partial to fedora hats while never comfortable with what he terms lad culture he spent most of his s and s socialising with groups of male friends often in bars that all changed when he got married at thereafter he says his wife gilly began to arrange dinner parties and gatherings he was largely content with her taking the social lead although a little bit resentful that if i ever suggested someone who wasnt in that circle it kind of never happened after a while he realised that his old friends were in a different zone to the rest of my life and in any case most of them had settled into similar partnercurated social scenes themselves a development that was only cemented by children and the parental relationships formed in the schoolyard novick savours the relationships in his active social life but says its per cent generated by gilly if she didnt do it there would be tumbleweed going through my calendar wilsonsmith attributes male social passivity to a lack of emotional engagement and a preoccupation with other aspects of life like work money and sport in the banshees of inisherin neither man is married and social life is stripped down to the mundane happenings of one lone bar wherein the fracturing of a friendship is played out in the most public fashion nowadays there are far more discreet and subtle though no less hurtful ways of bringing a friendship to a close journalist and impresario mat snow is still pained by the experience of losing a friend in an online spat about brexit in it was a complex debate about whether the labour market favoured eastern europeans with superior trade skills over poorly trained lowpaid british workers or if such criticism of the eu was just a pretext for xenophobia according to snow his friend of almost years could only see brexit as a racist reaction and announced a purge of anyone who thought otherwise the friend unfriended snow on facebook prompting him to write two apologetic emails i said im terribly sorry if ive upset and offended you i really didnt mean it to get this far snow recalls he didnt respond a few years later there was an online event involving both men that spurred snow to write to his former friend once more but again there was no response finally after another attempt at contact a while later the exfriend replied with a terse little message making it clear that he was not available for friendship snow says he remains upset about the breach and would like a reconciliation even if they dont return to the easy friendship they had before i still miss him i quite often dream that were friends again and its an enormous relief and pleasure which i think would be the feeling i would get if it were to happen in real life yet he concedes that the friendship was circumscribed based on shared musical interests rather than openhearted exchanges about their emotional lives on a personal level he says i am somewhat guarded just as a matter of habit i dont like to think of myself as a needy person though im probably a lot needier than i let on even to myself friendship is as old as humanity but its role in modern life has grown more prominent as traditional obligations to family or tribe have faded or disappeared unlike those relationships friendship is freely chosen it is an act of individual will which can affirm a persons worth people with a lot of friends after all are seen as socially successful but friendships can be freely terminated which can seem like a damning character judgment an acutely personal rejection tom not his real name is a chief financial officer gay and single on two occasions hes had intimate friendships that have been suddenly withdrawn without warning in both cases after a long period of silence lasting many years the former friends got back in contact but they were unable to acknowledge what had taken place or why with any degree of candour in the first instance two flatmates who were his closest friends and also a couple stopped talking to him moved out and ceased all contact it felt like an assault he says it made me have a kind of mini nervous breakdown yet rather than lose faith in friendship he continues to value the vital part that friends play in his life even if he often takes on more of the burden of maintenance as a single person ive always known that ive had to put a little extra work into friendships he says culturally our perception of friendship has changed in no small part due to a television sitcom which began in and managed to domesticate the friendship group into a kind of surrogate family friends ran for years until the characters started to pair off have families themselves and the magical glue that held them and the comedy together came unstuck a process that recurs repeatedly across real life medical research shows that enduring friendships can enable us to cope better with setbacks and are a bulwark against mental illhealth with that in mind perhaps its worth noting that one of the stars of friends matthew perry who played chandler bing states in his new memoir that while fame brought drug addiction and abject misery the thing that several times saved him from death was the friendships he made on the show he compared the support to that offered by penguins who surround an injured penguin and prop it up until it can walk on its own thats kind of what the cast did for me perry said as the wellknown old advertising jingle almost had it when you pick up a friendship theres so much more to enjoy,2022-10,love blind go old saying whereas friendship

more than families plan to take to the streets on saturday in uk cities to call on the government to provide affordable childcare and flexible working and improve parental leave the campaigns organisers pregnant then screwed expect people to take part in the halloweenthemed march of the mummies in london three parents explain why they are participating and how the issue of childcare has affected them i regularly borrow money from friends when rebecca lester a doctor in liverpool was offered a dream job in london she had to think twice about whether she could afford to take the position despite being on a decent salary lester a single parent struggles to afford childcare costs i have to borrow money from friends regularly she says lester is worried about the financial implications of the move to london when i started looking at the reality of the situation i started to panic imagine being a consultant in hospital medicine with over years of training and not being able to afford childcare costs you get nothing for being a single parent who is a moderate earner i have to pay the same costs as a twoparent highearning family there are people in much worst positions my salary is decent but one salary is not enough with childcare costs that arent reduced on top of the a month for a fulltime nursery place before taxfree childcare calculations lester pays about a month in babysitter fees for any extra hours she works outside the nurserys am to pm weekday hours she says childcare costs for her twoyearold son are double the cost of her mortgage nursery fees have gone up twice since he started in june obviously they have to cover their costs i dont blame the nurseries they have such a difficult job and they have to pay staff i felt forced into making this choice leonora catherall did not expect to quit the job she loved after her daughter was born in i was brought up by a real battleaxe feminist when i imagined my own life as a mother i assumed that of course i could go back to work and have it all as a parent she says but then she calculated that after childcare commuting and food costs she would only make about a month as her takehome pay at the londonbased charity where she worked was about all to give my child to other people to look after full time she says although she was passionate about her job the slim margins pushed her to become a stayathome parent the tradeoff was really difficult i felt forced into making this choice her daughter started preschool in september and catherall hoped she would be able to work in the afternoons i thought id be able to do something economically advantageous in those hours but theres not enough flexible remoteworking opportunities she says her daughter begins school next year and she is planning to retrain as a teacher in large part to align her hours more closely to her childs catherall hopes the march will impress upon the government the severity of the situation above all else we are asking the government take it seriously they have to have a reality check and an attitude change we want to contribute to the economy lauren a communications professional is taking part in the leeds march to demand better government investment in childcare my concern is that the government will say everything is expensive now but its not newly expensive its just getting worse i really hope they take a look at other models used around the world she says you have to be earning a huge amount for childcare not to be unaffordable we have a joint income of almost and its stretching us i have no idea how those earning less manage she would like to have a second child but is being held back by childcare costs its unlikely we will be able to afford to do that until our daughter is at least receiving the free hours of childcare for three to fouryearolds living in england by that time i will be and not comfortable having a child at that age as we already lost a baby at weeks lauren who pays about monthly for three days of nursery a week emphasises the economic implications the shortfall of affordable childcare is having on parents the government makes it as difficult as possible for young families to work we want to work we want to continue building our careers and contributing to the economy she says adding no one but the highest earners can comfortably afford childcare

organisation in after being sacked by her employer over voicemail a day after notifying them of her pregnancy its impossible for most families to survive without two incomes yet weve created an environment that prevents many mothers from working or working the number of hours that they want to work the liberal democrat mp munira wilson said she was joining the march to tell ministers that no one should be pushed into poverty for deciding to start a family working families are being ignored by this government as childcare costs soar and parents struggle to balance work and home life she

mothers said they had experienced negative and possibility discriminatory experiences during their pregnancy while on maternity leave or upon their return to work the uks childcare costs rank among the most expensive in the world pregnant then screwed is calling for reforms to the sector increased financial support for new parents and for all work to be flexible by default according to the organisation of pregnant mothers will have to cut their maternity leave short owing to financial hardship and of women who had an abortion in the past five years said childcare costs had been a factor

childcare for actor and writer solemani the march is about demanding a shift in the way we approach motherhood in our culture we need to reorient ourselves on the roadmap of humanity because we know that we all start from the same place which is that our success our ability to thrive and be healthy is dependent on the financial emotional and psychological wellbeing of our mothers said solemani who is flying to the uk to attend the domestic economy is not recognised you know in the financial index its an unwaged labour but its a necessary labour the world will collapse if we went on strike she added we need to invest in our culture we need to see proper change instead of going in the direction they are mandu reid the leader of the womens equality party said the government should appoint

cost of continuing work while raising a child with the parental leave offered the numbers did not add up she said and she terminated the pregnancy had there been free universal childcare and proper shared parental leave reid said she could have made a different choice it is a calculation that she says is now being further complicated for many by the cost of living crisis she said childcare was

its everywhere its everywhere the little girl cried with delight as she threw the bubbles up into the air washing the mud off her hands an hour earlier she had been forlornly sitting on a chair disengaged with her surroundings and not speaking so wed made mud by mixing dry red earth with water and she had begun to paint with it becoming totally immersed this state of immersion or wallowing is crucial to a childs learning forming neural links in the brain moments like this are why i love working with young children tuning into them giving quality attention and creating fun new play activities that capture their imaginations yet giving children this kind of attention is only getting harder since covid there has been an increase in the number of children with special educational needs and language delay with the continuing shortfall in earlyyears funding it is a greater challenge than ever to meet all the childrens needs and keep them safe it is costing many parents a small fortune to send their children to nursery our nursery charges a day for am to pm or a week the governments answer it has been consulting about changing the childcare ratio in earlyyears settings from four children to an adult to five with some reports that the government might remove the ratio altogether the coalition government increased the ratio for twoyearolds in from to the current level of which has been putting pressure on staff ever since in surveys of nursery managers parents and staff the findings are clear nobody wants this legislation what they do want is for the government to pay the full price for the places they provide and not to leave it to those who dont get free places to make up the shortfall thanks to a freedom of information request submitted by neil leitch of the early years alliance we now know that the government was well aware it was shortchanging nurseries when it created the scheme and that socalled free places would have to be subsidised by other parents the resulting exorbitant cost is forcing mothers out of the workforce and back into the home meanwhile a lot of private nurseries cant keep their staff because hours are long and pay and conditions not good this means they have to use agency staff which is unsettling for the children will quince recently minister for children and families visited sweden in the summer on a factfinding mission to see how nurseries there work to higher ratios than in england its a shame he couldnt learn from their other policies for example swedens universal system of early childhood education for children aged one to six in which preschools provide hours of free service with capped and affordable costs for additional hours or the months of wellpaid and very flexible parental leave swedish experts took four years to research what would work best for children families and the workforce and came up with the current system it transformed the previous fragmented childcare provision into an integrated universal education system in the uk we have many experts desperate to transform our broken system but they are simply not being listened to twoyearolds are famous for their tantrums helping children learn to selfregulate or selfcalm is the goal in early years when an upset individual instead of hitting out snatching screaming and crying shouting and throwing things learns through patient interventions with trained staff to manage their emotions and to ask for help not so easy when you havent learned to speak yet or when english isnt spoken at home or when you have a learning disability or when youve been affected by trauma when i arrived at work recently for my shift a colleague was in the bathroom struggling to remove the many layers of soakingwet clothing from a small child who was furiously wriggling crying tired and hungry as she tried to calm him singing you are my sunshine on a loop while being sprayed with water as another child put her hand flat under one tap and a third child was ramming a toy banana up another tap the current ratio is she should have had another child in there if this really was just a numbers game but its not is it its childrens lives and we should be respecting them and giving them the very best beginnings possible and the stress on the female workforce is not sustainable not fair and not healthy changing the ratio to will be unsafe for children and adults alike and further challenge the quality of the childs experience i first started working in a community nursery in the late s went on to start a community nursery in the s and was part of an expanding underfives campaign movement for better pay and more and better provision in we argued for an hour now nearly years later working in the twoyearolds room of a state nursery school i earn an hour an increase of a decade the staff are so dedicated and the quality of care is outstanding most of my colleagues work five days a week fulltime or parttime while it is challenging and exhausting there are many rewarding moments just recently i celebrated with a child how far hed come in a year i reminded him how difficult he had found things months earlier he was lashing out unable to share unable to articulate his needs flying into a rage and now here he was coming to me and saying what he wanted rather than grabbing it off another child two is a very special age children transform physically going from toddling to tearing around at speed climbing balancing and riding bikes they transform socially and emotionally moving from playing alongside other children with all the friction that entails to making friends and creating imaginary games together they develop their ability to listen and understand acquiring language sometimes two their confidence grows watching these transformations is why the work is so rewarding but also why it is demanding and skilled work that must be properly resourced and properly paid these children are our future instead of mealymouthed costcutting exercises that deny the children the care and attention they need and deserve we should be investing in them at this critical stage of their lives all the indicators show that their futures and ours depend on it the author is an early years worker at a state nursery,2022-10,everywhere everywhere little girl cried delight threw bubble air washing mud

make use of free childcare hours for some parents paying for childcare will be their biggest expense and a struggle when other essential bills are soaring the cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two has risen from an average of a week in to this year according to the latest figures so it is more important than ever to claim everything you are entitled to mandy garner a spokesperson for the jobs site workingmums says we know that many parents are not claiming all the available support whether because they find it too complicated or they simply dont know about it but with fees so high and continuing to rise it can make such a difference to claim every bit of support you can for example some parents qualify for free childcare for twoyearolds if they receive certain benefits in england every parent is eligible for hours of free childcare a week for three and fouryearolds during term time while working parents may be able to claim hours of free childcare a week to be eligible for the latter you will need to earn a certain amount there are different schemes in scotland wales and northern ireland the free hours can be put towards the cost of approved childcare providers such as nurseries or childminders claim taxfree childcare if you are working under the governments taxfree childcare scheme working parents can also receive some taxfree money towards the cost of childcare for children aged or under parents can get up to a topup four times a year for each child towards the cost of childcare parents claiming the support must set up a government account for every parents pay in the government adds up to a maximum of a year until a child is and up to for disabled children until they turn you need to apply for the scheme through the hm revenue and customs website get help if you are claiming universal credit working parents on universal credit can claim back up to of childcare costs every month the most you can get back each month is for one child and for two or more children to be eligible you and your partner if you live together will need to be working or have a job offer you need to have less than in savings and be on universal credit to apply if you are unsure about what help is available you can use the governments childcare calculator to see what support you can get as there may be different options for you you can also find more information on the governments childcare choices website seek community support check your local authoritys family information services for guidance it should be able to provide lists of registered childminders nurseries clubs and activities in your area your local authority may have its own childrens centres that offer support in your area too these could include stay and play sessions for toddlers that are free or involve a small fee you could also ask on your local facebook and nextdoor page to find out what is going on in your area in some areas parents have taken it upon themselves to try to do something about the situation for example the free app fetching was set up by parents wanting to share the school run some councils have community nurseries that are run on a notforprofit basis they may have a waiting list but the cost can be hundreds of pounds a month cheaper than private nurseries for information about these search your local authority website make

your local authority may run specific activities and trips away that are worth exploring schools may also have information about holiday and other schemes nanny sharing this year there has been an increase in nanny salaries across the uk according to the nannytax salary index for example in london the average cost for a nanny in was a month or a year the annual figures are based on a live out nanny working hours a week and these are gross amounts to reduce the burden some families nannyshare by dividing the nannys time between a few families or having them take care of both children at once this way the cost can be split when you employ a nanny you must register with hmrc as an employer sites such as childcarecouk tinies and koru kids are worth searching for people in your area who may want to nannyshare remember that you have responsibilities as an employer the site nannytax can help you work out how much tax and national insurance should be paid grandparents friends and family nurseries and nannies are too expensive for many families but if you have parents family or friends who are able to help they can be a godsend bear in mind that under the childcare act anyone other than close family looking after your child for more than two hours a day between pm and am babysitters for instance or for more than days a year outside the childs own home must be registered as a

a fun game to play for british parents seeking to drive themselves up the wall is to read about the childcare systems in other countries finland a public early years education service for preschool children underpinned by a right to daycare for every citizen which is free for lowerincome families and a home care subsidy for those that want to look after their children at home france statefunded creches available to children from the age of two and a half months with a strong historical notion that the government should facilitate a mothers ability to work outside the home germany children have a legal right to childcare and prices are as low as to to per child a month denmark every child aged between and six guaranteed a place in the public childcare system with of the cost consisting of government subsidies it is truly sickening and im genuinely surprised that parents here arent shutting down the country with a national strike sign him up in utero a friend advised me when i told her i was pregnant but after looking at the fees for the charming bilingual french nursery nearby i concluded after regaining consciousness that id have to go for a councilrun childrens centre they quite reasonably only sign up babies who have been born so i finally staggered in when he was five weeks old around his actual due date they said they might have a place in may a month after im supposed to go back to work a different kind of work this is my freelance kind of work which im doing while the baby teethes loudly in the living room with my mother but no guarantees like many mothers i digested this news while having a silent panic attack before intoning in a shellshocked sort of way well i suppose ill have to give up my entire career in order to look after this baby and im one of the lucky ones i only need two days a week why should i pay for you to have a child if you cant afford to look after your child dont have one another taxpayer might complain admittedly theyd have to be someone completely devoid of empathy but there are more and more of those about these days the only real manifestation of trickledown economics in my view the rejoinder to which might be why should i pay for someone to have had a child in who is now in a dementia nursing home or why should any of us pay for anything why dont we just i dont know roll around in our own excrement because what is society what is humanity lets just all be chimps picking fleas off each other which is actually quite a nice communal childcare model come to think of it at least when compared with what is available in britain the uk has the second most expensive childcare system in the developed world and a government that basically assumes that until a child is two but usually three when some free childcare hours kick in the mother because lets be honest it is almost always the woman will simply give up her job to devote her life to unpaid childcare or else grandparents will step in usually the grandmother who might want to enjoy her retirement after a lifetime spent caring for her own children especially as that retirement may well have been unfairly delayed by the government at very short notice or may not actually have the mobility required to look after a heavy and demanding preschooler its all symbolic of a hideously dated attitude to the value of womens work which also manifests in the low wages paid to nursery and preschool staff and the deliberate underfunding of the whole system i asked parents to contact me with their views on what is wrong with the childcare system and was so inundated by rants that im still sifting through them heres an incomplete list preposterous fees that are only getting higher due to the cost of living and energy crises a complete lack of flexibility making life all but impossible for freelance and shift workers the free hours a week not being actually hours but hours if the nursery is kind enough to let you spread them over the school holidays too some parents for example students and those on lower incomes being locked out of the free hours system completely obscene bureaucracy lack of wraparound care the assumption that parents can just patch together childcare in the school holidays or else afford expensive holiday clubs a system that discourages paid work for low earners and single parents and expects those on universal credit to pay childcare costs upfront for later reimbursement yearslong waiting lists one mother signed her foetus up when she was nine weeks pregnant and her child received a place when she was months old a closure and recruitment crisis and inadequate provision for disabled children that forces their mothers out of the workforce it is in other words a complete and utter shitshow that works for almost no one if only the parents who could afford childcare reproduced as per the rightwing edict then the birthrate would plummet even further than it has already many women are already delaying motherhood because they cannot afford it the government wants the country to work harder yet it ignores the clear economic benefit of an affordable functioning childcare system in favour of penalising parttime workers further and tinkering with staff ratios that would put children in danger because thats who it is about ultimately children you can make the economic case for childcare until the cows come home but far more important is the wellbeing and education of children who have a right to highquality care and education that meets their social and emotional needs they also benefit from having parents with a good worklife balance who arent on the verge of mental collapse why should i pay for you to have a child is essentially an irrelevant question when that child already exists in the world unless you believe in child neglect as political policy a fair society respects and takes care of its young citizens as well as their parents the uk is failing at both on october im going to be

the question i have lost touch with the person i thought was my best friend we met at school when she came for an exchange year from her home country for years she was the most important person in the world to me and we shared so much about five years ago she went to america for a job and before she left she visited me and it was wonderful we had been struggling to keep in touch as we started working and building our lives in our respective countries but i never doubted her time on the other side of the world would only mean more for us to share with one another she wrote me one postcard from america and i kept asking her parents for her address so i could write to her there as her email address no longer worked but it never came through social media via her brother as she is not active online i see she has now married her boyfriend who followed her out to the us and that she lives back in her home country again and has had a baby it hurts massively that such big life events happened to her and she seems not to have even thought about me i wrote a letter to send to her saying how devastated i am via the address of her parents house which i still know off by heart i cant bring myself to send it in case she never replies or tells me some horrible truth should i send it philippas answer i receive many emails telling me similar stories to yours a tale of two friends who were once close and then one appears to let the friendship go it seems in your case that even before your friend left for america keeping up had been a struggle peoples inclinations when it comes to friendships differ some are still best friends with people they played with in primary school while others although possibly pleased to bump into someone they once knew well lean more towards forming closer bonds with people who are more involved in their current lives im not saying one way of being is superior to the other or one is moral and the other not just that these different ways of being in the world come naturally to each of us if you are naturally a good longdistant friend you may be baffled and hurt by a friend who has moved away and who lost touch with you because if you did that it would mean there had been some sort of hurt or a misunderstanding and if you cannot think what that is you might assume they are being cruel or that you must be in some way unlikable it is just as likely that they have a different friendship pattern to you if your friend is someone whose friendships tend to have more to do with the present than the past she might be baffled to be told she has hurt you because she hasnt been in touch her assumptions about friendship in general might not be the same as yours there are also those bestfriend friendships that are almost like having a significant other like having a partner almost and then a real significant partner comes along a true love interest and the bestfriend friendship it seems was just a rehearsal for a fullblown sexual relationship again this is fine if this was so for both parties but if one of you assumed your friendship was a bond for life and the other that such friendships are superseded by love again there may well be hurt everyone will have their own inclination habits and beliefs when it comes to how we make and maintain friends and what we owe our friends and how we should be with them what is acceptable unacceptable loyal and disloyal and we will differ from each other if we assume that others have the same ways of being with people that we have its likely that its our own assumptions and expectations that cause us hurt rather than our old friend doing anything intentionally to reject or hurt us your friend has been busy and involved in her life she may have assumed that you were similarly involved in yours rather than feeling hurt that you had lost touch if you want to hear from your old friend maybe try to contact her through her brother on social media you can tell her you miss her but if you tell her that you are devastated because she lost touch you would be in danger of making her feel guilty our friends tend to be the people who make us feel good we are friends with people who support our current view of ourselves and who confirm our identity your friends idea of herself may be different now than when you met at school you say she was the most important person in the world to you im sure at the time you mattered to her too but peoples lives move and change priorities change you cannot turn the clock back being someones most important person might possibly be too much pressure for some people if you do rekindle your friendship it will be a different one to that bond you had back in school if you have a question send a brief email to askphilippaobservercouk,2022-10,question lost touch person thought wa best friend met school came exchange year home country year wa important person world shared much five year ago went america job left visited wa wonderful struggling keep touch started working building life respective country never doubted time side world would mean u share one another wrote one postcard america kept asking

event happened seems even thought wrote letter send saying devastated via address parent house still know heart cant bring send case never reply tell horrible truth send philippas answer receive many email telling similar story tale two friend close one appears let friendship go seems case even friend left america keeping struggle people inclination come friendship differ still best friend people played primary school others although possibly pleased bump someone knew well lean towards forming closer bond people involved current life im saying one way superior one moral different way world come naturally u naturally good longdistant friend may baffled hurt friend ha moved away lost touch would mean sort hurt misunderstanding think might assume cruel must way unlikable likely different friendship pattern friend someone whose friendship tend present past might baffled told ha hurt hasnt touch assumption friendship general might also bestfriend friendship almost like significant like

the childrens commissioner for england has poured cold water on liz trusss proposal to scrap regulations governing childtostaff ratios in nurseries describing it as tinkering around the edges and calling instead for ambitious and transformative reform of the childcare sector in an interview with the guardian dame rachel de souza said childrens safety and wellbeing must be paramount in any plans to reform childcare and she said she thought it was really depressing if the current conversation about childcare focused purely on ratios the former headteacher whose work as childrens commissioner has highlighted the cost of living crisis affecting families across the country also said she thought benefits should be uprated in line with inflation an issue the chancellor kwasi kwarteng will address in his fiscal plan to be published at the end of this month concerns have been mounting about the state of the childcare sector in england with parents facing spiralling costs nurseries complaining of underfunding and the number of places available for preschool children going down the government has said it is exploring a range of options to make childcare more affordable and easier to access to help boost economic growth through getting people back to work one proposal is to relax childcare ratios from one adult to four twoyearolds to allow one adult to care for five children a move which has been overwhelmingly opposed by everyone involved in the sector on safety grounds ministers are also reported to be considering getting rid of the regulatory requirement on ratios altogether leaving it up to childcare settings to decide how many staff they need to care for their children de souza said she had looked at the figures and although it might save some money she dismissed it as tinkering financially i do think its really depressing if the conversation we have about childcare is about ratios not about a vision for transforming childcare this is a moment to actually really create that vision she said what were hearing from government is they want a growth plan and for that growth plan to work they need people to be in the workforce and i would imagine theres an interest in childcare because they need mums and dads to be working so this is a great moment to look at what fantastic childcare actually is asked about another proposal under discussion to give a flexible childcare budget direct to parents in place of a paidfor space in nursery de souza agreed the current system was ungainly and funding streams were complicated for parents but she added im not saying giving all the money up front is the answer what im saying is lets do the thinking to make this system work for everybody particularly the most vulnerable children on wednesday the childrens commissioner published her own report vision for childcare which included new research highlighting the varied uptake of the governments current offer of hours free childcare a week for all three and fouryearolds in overall uptake was but significantly lower for certain groups including chinese irish traveller gypsyroma children children with english as an additional language children in london and those with profound learning difficulties an audit of local authorities also found it was difficult to access information on childcare providers in more than a quarter of local authorities while for of local authorities the childcare directory didnt contain all the information recommended in statutory guidance the report said schools should be at the heart of a new model for early education and childcare with school rolls falling and the number of pupils in state primaries set to fall by a fifth over the next decade de souza said spare capacity in schools should be used to provide more early years provision the report also called for childminders to be placed front and centre of the new childcare offer with an agency for childminders in every local area to provide a bespoke brokerage service for parents to meet individual needs de souza also suggested removing ofsted from regulation of childminders suggesting it might be better done by a local authority for the past decade within government there has been a relentless focus on driving up school standards the report said now this focus must be extended to the early years every parent and carer should have confidence that the early education they choose for their child will be of the highest quality but we also need a flexible childcare offer that wraps around education and that works for the realities of family life neil leitch ceo of the early years alliance said over recent days we have seen a whole range of seemingly random illthoughtout and in many cases completely unworkable proposals for early years reform from government as such we share the childrens commissioners view that what both the sector and families need is a longterm ambitious vision for childcare and early education in this country and not more tinkering around the edges a department for education spokesperson said we will carefully consider the commissioners recommendations as we explore a wide range of options to make childcare more accessible and affordable for parents,2022-10,childrens commissioner england ha poured cold water liz truss proposal scrap regulation governing childtostaff ratio nursery

nothing can prepare you for the birth of your first child the joy the horror the total discombobulation but also the humbling awareness of just how little you knew about the realities of raising children tired babies do not as i had expected just nod off nor do all newborns love the car mine screamed with such earshattering persistence we had to stop driving but ask any expectant parent about the state of british childcare and you will settle upon a seemingly universal understanding the system is woefully unfit for purpose after a brexit exodus decimated staffing levels in nurseries the pandemic quietly pushed the early years sector past the point of no return and this winter promises even more hardship deliberate underfunding means providers have little choice but to charge astronomical fees which have increased at a rate that far outstrips wages to cover their own sizeable outgoings and as energy prices rise so too will costs trying to find a nursery place for my daughter this year revealed just how depleted the provision is with month waiting lists as standard and some waits so long their lists were closed demand far outstrips supply thanks to a staffing crisis that shows no signs of abating as lowpaid workers jump the sinking ship in favour of better pay and less stressful jobs between and the number of childcare providers in england plummeted by and of early years providers say the government funding they receive for three and fouryearolds does not cover the cost of delivering those places one nursery owner in the northeast tells me i havent been able to pay myself since november ive had to take a second job just so i can live it doesnt take much creativity to imagine how this crisis is spilling over into the lives of mothers and i say mothers because it is women who are being disproportionately impacted by this broken system i know im not the only one who compares my wages each month with the cost of childcare and wonders if the stress of juggling both only to be barely breaking even is worth it nearly threequarters of parttime workers are women and of them feel they have no choice but to work parttime friends share their own nightmare stories one in fulltime work texts to say her childs nursery is closing its doors permanently with just a weeks notice due to staffing shortages leaving her scrambling for childcare cover another says their nursery struggling to cope with rising energy bills is suddenly charging an extra a day for lunch and activities but this winter as household costs continue to rise things could become even more dystopian in the past year the number of women not working in order to look after family has risen by a trendbucking increase the likes of which hasnt been seen for years with women between and most affected put simply too many women can no longer afford to work and as the cost of living and energy crises bite this steady stream of mothers disappearing from the workforce threatens to build to a raging torrent florencia is being forced to make a maddening choice between working and staying afloat she and her husband employ a nanny to look after their twoyearold daughter who has special needs while they both work with the spike in costs we can no longer afford the nanny so i have decided to take time off she tells me laura a yearold canadian who has two children left her staff job at a top london university this year after paying for childcare she says she wasnt even breaking even it was like is it even worth working lauren also has been unemployed since she was made redundant during the pandemic i cant afford to pay for a nursery until i get a job and i cant seriously look for a job without childcare she says my husband works but were in our overdraft every month now as things are getting more and more expensive she says that her sense of identity has suffered from not being something other than someones mum or wife these stories should frighten us all they point to a growing trend of working mothers being pushed by force and en masse back into the home too hyperbolic i dont think its an exaggeration at all i think this is exactly what were seeing says joeli brearley the founder of pregnant then screwed these are women who want to work but have no viable means of doing so who are being failed by decades of government shortsightedness people still do not grasp this notion that if you invest in the childcare sector youre investing in the economy because it enables people to work says brearley what they think is my taxes are paying for your children and thats not fair at the end of this month more than families are set to participate in mass protests over political inaction on the issue and its about time investing in childcare could boost the annual income of working mothers in the uk by bn according to a study by the centre for progressive policy that translates to an additional in their economic output surely something even the most fiscally or liberally conservative governments can recognise as a positive but for now says maryann stephenson of the womens budget group its a bleak picture if women cant afford childcare they either depend more on informal care from their families which can lead to older women leaving the workforce or they can only work parttime reduced hours or they leave the labour market altogether government proposals to reduce stafftochild ratios in nurseries as a way to reduce fees are largely unsupported by providers and parents alike i ask the nursery owner whether it will make any difference for nurseries already operating at a loss not a chance she tells me theres no nursery in the land thats going to be able to reduce their fees as more working mothers are pushed to the fringes the consequences will be felt in the gender pay gap the monitoring of which is itself at risk and in the long term more and more women of retirement age will sleepwalk into poverty without the opportunity to build up healthy pensions during their working years but work is also about identity it is an anchor to society a reflection of our selfworth a life raft of normality when family life threatens to consume us theres a reason those chintzy gin and tonic mummys little helper signs are so commonplace a glib expression of just how awful it can be to be a stayathome parent it should no longer be taboo to say that lots of mothers have no desire to stay at home and that many children benefit from being looked after in organised childcare settings generations of women not hundreds but millions from the very youngest

a woman has been told she cannot breastfeed her baby on campus at one of the worlds most prestigious arts schools jasmijn toffano a student at central saint martins was initially led to believe there would be no problem bringing her newborn daughter to classes but said the college reversed that days before she was due to start her course leaving her struggling to find childcare and to fulfil her course obligations now she is campaigning to convince every university in the uk to provide spaces where parents can care for their children on or near campus what i would like to see in the future is that students who have children do not have to drop out of university because of the lack of support i believe we can make a change and its not impossible she said toffano and her husband riccardo mangiapelo are in discussions with the college whose alumni include stella mccartney louise wilson john galliano and alexander mcqueen and which is part of university of the arts london ual all parties have indicated a willingness to work together to find a reasonable solution the couple have suggested that over the longer term higher educational institutions are supported to either provide oncampus nursery space or work with established local nurseries to provide affordable childcare for students and staff this should be a standard for all universities and should be supported by the government to help universities and students and staff cover the costs the problem arose shortly before toffano was due to return to her graphic communication design classes this academic year according to the times she told staff in january that she was pregnant revisited the matter with them in the summer and was under the impression there would be no problem with her plan to breastfeed her now twomonthold daughter chloe on campus but that message changed two days before she was due to return as a shortterm solution while toffanos husband was on paternity leave he travelled with her and spent the day in a cafe with the baby with toffano breastfeeding between lectures now however the couple would need to find a nanny to care for chloe until she is old enough to take up her nursery place an arrangement toffano has said would force her to abandon her plan to breastfeed ual decided that to routinely have a child on campus would contravene its policy the university said our campuses are filled with specialist equipment and machinery which create a potentially dangerous environment for children and babies currently our health and safety policy and insurances do not allow infants or children on campus except for short exceptional visits this means that the university isnt able to facilitate access for children and babies on a regular basis as we cannot guarantee their safety we have apologised to ms toffano for the conflicting information she received in the first instance and the time it took for her to gain clarity on the matter this shouldnt have happened and we are sorry for the distress this has caused we recognise there is more that we can do to provide better facilities for caregivers and this is something that we are actively engaged in improving ual will be reviewing its current policies in light of this case we have offered ms toffano access to a private room and fridge to allow her to express milk and we will work with her to ensure it is suitable for her needs our priority is to ensure ms toffano can complete her course and we are in touch with her to discuss what adjustments can be made to support her,2022-10,woman ha told breastfeed

flashback to nct and im asking our course leader alison about going to the loo so you say that we are not supposed to leave them unattended ever so how exactly do i without putting too fine a point on it go to the toilet im six months in now and have eventually learned that sometimes you need to let the baby cry so you can go to the toiletmake a cup of teashove a cold samosa in your mouth while you mourn your past life of nicely prepared little lunches i used to feel guilty doing this my husband going back to work at four months coincided with the baby suddenly needing constant entertainment and i started to feel guilty about that too because sometimes i would put him in the bouncer and read a book my tight minute set of politically correct nursery rhymes having fallen flat whence had i caught this guilt not from my own mother or any of the older women i know not social media influencers whom i avoid completely and not parenting books either i opened the wonder weeks observed its literal checklist of developmental milestones and decided it was a recipe for madness i had already missed the boat on tummy time research led me to resolve that i had somehow absorbed what judith warner calls totalreality motherhood in other words its the cultural notion that motherhood is supposed to constitute your entire lifes work with all other aspects of your identity sacrificed on the altar of degree parenting it seems this pernicious ideology began in the s but reached fever pitch at the turn of the millennium these days it afflicts my generation through bastardised social media filtered versions of attachment theory and gentle parenting philosophies to quote one article now mothers were always to be on engaged in relationships with their children that were at once kinesthetic tirelessly management oriented and unrelenting in their emotional solicitations eliane glaser frames it as the cult of the perfect mother elsewhere its intensive mothering or conscientious cultivation however it is described it boils down to the belief that every moment must have conspicuous educational or emotional value as far as ive read it is a largely western construct and is not only bad for women but also bad for children who should be allowed to discover the world for themselves or through play with other children it manifests in the competitive obsession with baby classes where everything is a learning opportunity see also the baby sensory movement hence perhaps my in hindsight insane decision to take a threemonthold premature infant to baby swimming an activity to which he objected to in the strongest terms what was i thinking and why did i feel so guilty when we quit perhaps its all a symptom of highly educated women being stripped of their identities overnight and needing some sort of outlet was this why all the other mothers in the introducingsolids workshop seemed to have a professorial knowledge i started to feel bad until i remembered that i have been consuming solid food myself for many years now with no problems if im still cutting up his food when hes ill devote some time to feeling bad about doing purees i havent liberated myself from all maternal guilt that would be impossible but in the last two months i have been mindfully giving less of a toss and am far happier the baby is happier too because his mother is less anxious none of these proponents of totalreality motherhood ever seem to take maternal mental health into account whether its pushing breastfeeding at all costs or telling you that any kind of sleep training will result in the same sad neglectful hush observed in romanian orphanages there never ever seems to be an acknowledgment that a mother on the verge of a breakdown might do more damage to her kid than a bottle of formula or a short time spent learning to selfsettle if youre wondering how i managed to successfully purge myself of perfectionism the answer is that i read two things first a research paper called accounting for variability in motherchild play on how motherchild play is culturally and class specific and actually undesirable second the book french children dont throw food by pamela druckerman which is a decade old but totally liberating reading it all of my memories of nannying in france began to resurface and something clicked into place french women are practically unique in the west in that they dont buy this intense perfectionism they dont ditch their jobs to do childcare they dont pounce the minute their child needs something they dont obsess about milestones and they dont constantly narrate their play their babies also apparently tend to sleep most importantly they often and it feels shocking to even write this put themselves first as lisabeth badinter writes in the conflict french women have avoided the dilemma of allornothing motherhood because unlike most europeans they have the benefit of historic recognition of their identities beyond motherhood badinter also notes that the childcare system there supports the expectation that the state should provide this service in order to facilitate parttime mothering unfortunately our own childcare system is sorely lacking but there is still much to take from the french mindset i genuinely think druckerman has saved my sanity now time to feed the baby but first ill feed myself whats working the baby visited his ancestral homeland and was read to in welsh by his nain and taid i also discovered seren swynol a soft toy that sings welsh nursery rhymes one for the christmas list whats not the baby

in the summer of mothers locked themselves into a yorkshire childrens centre to protest against its closure having expanded nursery provision to enable women to join the war effort the government drastically scaled back in four years around councilrun nurseries were shut then as now women knew what this meant for their prospects they were recast in their traditional role as carers and lost their financial independence childcare has remained one of the gaps in the welfare state ever since while the uk is relatively generous towards new mothers with maternity leave and free prescriptions and dentistry for a year after birth the state has never stumped up the investment necessary to ensure that parents are able to keep on working from when their children stop being babies until they start school in england cuts in public provision combined with privatisation and price rises have made a difficult situation worse with fees for undertwos doubling since the devolved administrations are all more generous and the number of free nursery hours in scotland has doubled at the end of this month a march of the mummies organised by the pressure group pregnant then screwed aims to push the issue up the agenda and persuade ministers to do more to support flexible working and parttime jobs so far the signs are that liz truss and her colleagues have their eyes and ears shut having had her idea of reducing ratios in childcare settings knocked back more than a decade ago ms truss is now considering even more radical deregulation one proposal is to scrap ratios altogether so that providers decide how many children each adult can care for another floated by a rightwing thinktank would see existing entitlements to free parttime nursery places withdrawn a third idea under discussion is to give nursery funding to parents instead to spend where they choose a measure that would further destabilise an already fragile sector while the lack of provision for most one and twoyearolds is the most glaring omission under current arrangements it is not the only one even once children start school there are weeks each year when schools are closed all year round school days end in the midafternoon by which time younger children are often exhausted even in termtime many parents struggle to combine jobs with family commitments a recent increase in the number of women not working because they are looking after relatives is the first such rise in at least years and of lone parents are mothers almost years since the launch of its flagship sure start programme here is a fresh opportunity for labour the institute for public policy research has crunched the numbers and says increased entitlements could be delivered for as little as m a year or around twice as much if all preschoolers in england were offered hours it also proposes an enhanced role for local authorities one of the problems with childcare is that it is not treated as vital social infrastructure meaning provision is not planned into new neighbourhoods in the way that schools are this is a nonsensical situation and a sexist one given the weight of evidence that women pay the price when societies refuse to organise childcare collectively as with other caring professions and teaching a more strategic approach to the mostly female early years workforce is also needed currently they are underpaid and underqualified it is a dangerous fantasy that the market can meet all these human challenges without clear direction from politicians unfortunately it is one that the current government

among the enormous social changes of recent decades is the fact that having children need no longer curtail a womans career in the early s only around half of women participated in the workforce since then the gap between male and female labour market participation has shrunk dramatically and in recent years researchers have found that young children benefit from formal childcare before they start school it is associated with better cognitive and social development for children from all backgrounds particularly for those from disadvantaged households having a decent system of subsidised early education and childcare is therefore doubly advantageous it can help to close the attainment gap it reduces sexbased inequalities and promotes the economic wellbeing of families by lifting the key barrier to returning to work that disproportionately affects mothers and it is good for the exchequer much of the money spent subsidising childcare is recouped by the treasury in the form of higher tax revenues as a result of higher lifetime female employment and earnings but in the uk there are serious gaps in our provision which proposals floated by the government last week would make even worse the uk has the third most expensive childcare in the oecd a particularly big problem is the cost of childcare for one and twoyearolds before the free entitlement of hours of childcare a week for weeks of the year kicks in at the age of three research out last week highlighted how it now costs almost twothirds of a parents takehome pay to put a child under two in fulltime nursery and worryingly the proportion of women staying out of the workforce to look after family has increased by in the last year the first increase in more than years according to the office for national statistics little wonder women report they are having to leave work because childcare is too expensive low margins rising wages and other costs have also reduced the number of nursery providers in the market in recent years with deprived areas particularly affected last years drop in the number of nursery providers was the biggest for six years parents urgently need access to more subsidised childcare especially for the under threes ideally the government should pledge to create a system of universal free childcare for all children under the age of five and flexible wraparound care for schoolage children this would boost the economy and promote chid wellbeing liz truss however has floated proposals to move the system in the opposite direction she is said to be considering scrapping minimum ratios of adult to children in early years settings altogether in a misguided attempt to reduce the costs of childcare this is likely to reduce the quality and safety and create a twotier system in which children in poorer areas are most likely to be consigned to poorquality and unsafe provision and she is also reportedly pursuing proposals to convert the subsidy for three and fouryearolds into a ayear cash voucher that parents could instead hand over to friends or family in informal arrangements this is likely to increase the attainment gap by social background reduce the availability of formal childcare even further if parents decide to withdraw their child as a result and inflate the price of formal childcare for all parents the best that can be said about this proposal is that it looks unlikely to happen the tory party has lost so much confidence in truss it seems increasingly improbable she will be able to get much reform through,2022-10,among enormous

zoe williams brings up liz trusss proposals to cut stafftochild ratios as a solution to the funding crisis faced by both maintained and private voluntary and independent pvi providers toddlers stop your running around liz truss is coming for you october truss put forward this idea in in the centreforum thinktank paper affordable quality new approaches to childcare and the following year as undersecretary of state for education and childcare in the report more great childcare both documents are riddled with inaccuracies which i detailed in in the article like an uncontrolled toddler elizabeth truss risks causing chaos in englands nursery education and child care sector published in the journal forum in the paper truss claimed that the british government spends over billion per year on preschool support more than germany france or the netherlands despite organisation for economic cooperation and development data showing that france and germany spend far more than the uk underfunding is the biggest challenge facing all providers in the sector resulting in a situation where maintained nursery schools once the envy of the world are closing and most pvi providers cant afford to pay their staff a wage commensurate with their qualifications and expertise if liz truss were to visit any of her local nursery schools or some of the pvi providers where i have worked as a mentor and assessor she would find that relaxing ratios is not their top priority she might also discover that toddlers rarely charge around in an uncontrolled manner but are generally focused on finding out as much as they can about the world they live in john wadsworth former senior lecturer in early childhood education london have an opinion on anything youve read in the guardian today

for the past few weeks weve been trying to get our little cherub to drink formula so her mum can have a bit more freedom the first few weeks of trying were calamitous as our doughy poppet seemed utterly repelled by the thought of latching on to anything that wasnt anatomically connected to someone she interpreted our first offerings of formula as here is some poison for you to drink now she gives us the annoyed but indulging response one typically gets from the words is pepsi ok which we consider progress my daughters attitude to me is generally similar i adore her but she thinks me merely pleasant holding me in the strained ambivalence my wife has for the people who do holiday cover for radio presenters my baby doesnt get many detailed mentions in this column partly because she seems like a bit of a hater and i refuse to engage with those but mostly because her most recent milestones are ones ive covered in lavish detail when my son went through them and i hate to repeat myself so please be contented that she has begun smiling and laughing and teething and can almost but not quite sit up by herself but as we near the end of the just keeping her alive stage which i promise does not mean we will cease trying to keep her alive we have begun to spy a new phase on the horizon so today is the first time ive been left to try and sustain her with my manly charms and frequent bottle use for hours as my wife goes off to my sisters hen under strict instructions not to text me anxious notes about my progress since ill only tell her everythings fine no matter what alls going well but it feels redundant to say that parenting a fivemonthold and a fouryearold simultaneously is challenging and that im enormously lucky that neither my wife nor i have to do so by ourselves very often i try to maintain this perspective as my daughter decides she doesnt want to feed at exactly the same time my son begins screaming because he has some orange juice on his hand it is am eventually my sons hand is cleaned and a brisk minute walk lulls the baby to sleep over the next few hours i receive a steady trickle of texts from family and friends who did not get my no texts injunction worried that im looking after a baby whos not fully into bottlefeeding or me i consider writing back a sniffy reply to the effect that i am a father of two who is more than capable of wrangling his children by himself thank you very much i dont do this as my left hand is holding a screaming baby and my right is on my phone researching those padded shirts with fake breasts that dads can wear there is more walking more wailing more reluctant feeding and i finally get both down by pm my phone buzzes no doubt their mum texting to see if everything is going ok her message just says

the often neglected bond between father and daughter is explored in charlotte wellss acclaimed debut film aftersun which opened in cinemas last week and stars normal peoples paul mescal and newcomer frankie corio it tells the tale of a woman looking back on a holiday she spent as a child with her father tale is probably the wrong word because its much more about atmosphere memory and the teasing ease and passing tensions that inform so many paternalfilial relationships as a father to three daughters im no stranger to the conspiratorial jokes and lighthearted joshing that can offer relief from the fraught battles frequently waged by mothers and daughters but being a father to a female child is not simply a joy its also an empirical fact that its socially improving a study by the lse found that men were less likely to hold sexist attitudes if they had a schoolaged daughter these findings have been underlined by another study published earlier this year that looked at the gender bias of us politicians it compared how much legislators interrupted janet yellen the chair of the us federal reserve from to with how much they interrupted men in that role transcripts of all meetings showed that there was a sharp increase in hostility towards yellen except in the case of those politicians with daughters as the authors of the first study wrote through parenting fathers of daughters may develop a better understanding of womens and girls disadvantages in society resulting in a significant shift in their attitudes towards gender norms my daughters have certainly not been shy about bringing those disadvantages to my attention while also making every effort to rise above them yet in spite of the instructive nature of parenting daughters as well as the fascinating interaction of gender difference the fatherdaughter relationship has seldom been the focus of films or indeed literature particularly in terms of daughters in childhood one notable exception in recent years was alexander paynes film the descendants featuring george clooneys perfectly pitched performance as a slightly hapless middleaged man struggling to guide his two daughters one a stroppy teenager the other a precocious youngster through their mothers death while effectively being guided by them despite the mournful subject matter its essentially a comedy which is perhaps the appropriate genre for a relationship that tends to use humour as a means of shared understanding in a sense those two stages precocious youngster stroppy teenager are a critical dividing line in life as well as art the prepubescent child like sophie in aftersun can be an endearing mixture of innocence dependence and trust but also capable of a kind of quasimaternal concern adolescence cracks that all open as budding womanhood thrusts its way forward and rudely announces that the rules have changed the transition is not always easy for fathers to adapt to that rapid shift from holding hands on the school walk to the youre not going out in that alarm at the teenagers show of sexuality and independence i can look back at the preteen years of my youngest daughter with the kind of hazy nostalgia that provides the look and feel of aftersun theres that treasured period in which youre the unquestioned repository of strength and security but also the unembarrassing source of interest and entertainment its when you get to play atticus finch to your questioning daughters scout that memorably staunch relationship at the heart of to kill a mockingbird this is what matt wotton from the london centre for applied psychology calls the easy phase child therapists talk of creating moments of connection and my youngest daughter and i would have bespoke adventures together reading the history of the world long drives listening and singing to music white water kayaking one time we drove across france just the two of us to visit friends in the cvennes my daughter was around the age of the girl in aftersun and the world through her eyes looked both incomprehensibly large and full of limitless promise she was young enough to want to share a room amid the vast surrounding wilderness with its wild boars and riflecarrying hunters but old enough to realise that the dear friend we were visiting was very ill she had less than a year to live and in one of those disarming role reversals i remember my daughter being worried about my feelings we use the phrase fastforward to convey jumping ahead in time but thats what it felt like when she was suddenly insisting that she had to stay late at a party and i was the funcrushing bore demanding to know how she was going to get home it was as if time had grown weary of linearity and decided to skip a whole period of adjustment wotton says that he sees a lot of men who struggle with the emotional demands of parenthood they tend to see the idea of helping their daughters through adolescence he says as an elite level of skill beyond their experience or knowhow they can do the stage when they are idealised by their young daughters but often go missing during the key teenage years of development the stereotype of the clueless father perplexed by a child who has become sexually attractive to boys and men is changing he says but its not yet out of date dad was absolutely at ease with boyfriends menstruation all my different friendships he was a tower of strength for me when he didnt understand he would simply ask and listen thats very seldom the version of events says wotton dryly but one way or another with or without their fathers help daughters do make it through those difficult transitional years and often strike up a more mature version of that initial pleasing and teasing relationship its mr bennet and elizabeth although hopefully without the rigid thcentury patriarchy the mood that permeates aftersun is that of loving acceptance as the grown woman recalls the young and slightly wayward father who took her on holiday wotton says that he finds as daughters grow into adulthood they often forgive their fathers for their hopelessness dad tried his best but made an absolute mess of it but he did so with good intent is the kind of typical reasoning he encounters theres usually something hiding out in the dads story he says and not infrequently its the fathers father who was even less equipped with emotional intelligence whats clear is that fathers need to accept losing the mantle of being their little girls superman the slings and arrows of family life tend to expose paternal shortcomings sooner or later my own daughters could no doubt identify some of my more glaring wrong turns but they are all blessed like the daughters wotton has seen with a marked talent for forgiveness they are all three of them cordelias only with a sense of humour im relieved to say there are no gonerils or regans in our family a tragic masterpiece it may be but king lear is no great advert for fatherdaughter relations a doddery egomaniac bequeathing his power and wealth in return for professions of love and two scheming daughters who have nothing but contempt for the old fool no one emerges well except the saintly cordelia happily i dont have a kingdom to disperse so there isnt much i have in common with lear other than three daughters and a habit of walking on the heath in raging storms but during the more challenging years we often employed in our household with heavy irony lears quote about goneril how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child however like most daughters mine have been anything but thankless in truth i am the one to be thankful they have taught me so much the lyrics of taylor swift the drenched delights of waterskiing and the discreet pleasures of long gossipfilled dog walks but most of all they have taught me how to be a father how they will look back on me how any daughter makes sense of her father is something none of us can ever know but lets hope its with the same

of all the phrases parents tell me they dislike cherish every moment is the winner time is a strange thing when you are caring for small humans and as i thought about it this week it is this phrase that keeps coming back to me its the idea that by feeling any negative emotion you are somehow squandering time i have been told by parents with postnatal mental health issues that this unrealistic phrase often said by older people has made them feel deep shame time is precious and to not feel constantly delighted by your child is a terrible waste i dont feel shame but ill confess that the occasional suggestion that this column is overly negative has wounded me ive been writing it in real time these past eight months i wrote notes for my first column while in hospital the sounds of women in labour all around me and though there have been struggles there have also been immense intense highs my son still feels miraculous to me but writing as it happens means real living feelings land on the page some dark some light theres no time to try to temper reality in retrospect to make it seem like its always plain sailing when i see new parents out and about with newborns i feel solidarity but also a strange mix of other emotions he was once so small and curled like a bug how could that time have passed so quickly why did i not realise how short those days would be at the time they felt unceasing in the whirl of feed sleep feed sleep i could not see an end to them the baby and i were still one and would cease to be he would open his eyes to the world and look beyond me and i would be gifted a whole new phase while mourning that which came before at the time the shock of his premature arrival left little room for reflection but had you asked me id have maybe said that i felt that the time in the third trimester when the baby should have still been safe inside me had been lost or even stolen now i say i got five extra weeks of him what a gift this time travel when you are raising a child it isnt that the hard parts arent hard but that time marches on so indefatigably that they almost mystically fade older people i think understand this which is why they often cant remember when you ask them about specific aspects of parenting such as my mum not recalling when she moved on from giving me purees or how they coped with certain difficulties in case it sounds as though her memory is going she just recited ts eliot to the baby i have measured out my life with coffee spoons i could measure the last year of mine in formula scoops i thought women have said to me that they suspect this amnesia might be evolutionary otherwise no one would have a second child time makes you sentimental and pain fades in the memory with sleeplessness rendering whole stages where the passing of time felt like treacle a blur im starting to understand that the hell of establishing breastfeeding felt at the time all consuming i doubt ill ever fully forget it but thinking about it now is like watching a film about someone else while sitting a great distance from the screen older people also give you outdated advice like telling you to start babies on solids at four months thats the other thing about time the official recommendations around parenting change so often that sometimes older generations might be made to feel that their input is irrelevant this is not the case the science around safe sleeping may be different but my mother still knows it seems instinctively how to comfort and entertain a baby and i am tearfully grateful for her years of graft and wisdom the letters ive had from older readers that say this series brings it all back to them vividly have been some of the most moving to me of course you can let time get on top of you if you allow it to on a tough day you can find yourself staring down the barrel of the next years wondering if youve got what it takes but then you find yourself excited about showing the baby the wizard of oz for the first time and of all the joys to come the other thing about time is that it becomes a precious commodity time to yourself time to work time to think my husband and i are constantly trying to find time when he isnt working hes with the baby trying to give me a break meanwhile im working while the baby sleeps should i be watching the flutter of his long eyelashes his cupidsbow mouth slightly opened instead i wonder he will only be this exact way once and ill have missed it typing this and so i put down this column and i take a minute or five to gaze at him and stroke the fine tuft of his hair i may not cherish every moment some of the nappies i have changed render that impossible but i am taking a little time every day to look and to feel and to try to remember to set it all in amber the sound of his breath the curve of his head his smell his fat little fingers curled around mine perhaps this finding moments to cherish is what those wellmeaning people mean i dont know where the time goes but i know that one day ill be glad i wrote it down whats working we have discovered a whole world of bus travel these past few weeks and it has opened up the city to us we love the childrensonly park at corams fields on the site of the old foundling hospital where my dad said he also took me as a baby we have been keeping children safe and off the streets of london for years

councils in england will be encouraged to open more highquality maintained nurseries as part of ambitious labour plans to transform childcare and ease pressure on struggling parents there are fewer than surviving state nursery schools across the country which are regarded as the jewel in the crown of early years education but have struggled to survive in the face of budget pressures labour is planning to expand the state nursery sector as part of wider plans to build a system of highquality affordable childcare that better meets the needs of modern families and their working lives with concerns about the cost and availability of childcare increasingly coming up on the doorstep labour is working on an extensive childcare offer ahead of the next election and has said it will be one of the issues on the partys pledge card this week the shadow education secretary bridget phillipson went to look at childcare and early years education in the baltic state of estonia where all children are guaranteed a place in staterun kindergartens from the age of months until they go to school at seven and parents pay just a month or less after announcing plans for fully funded breakfast clubs for every primary school in england phillipson is keen to develop wraparound care to extend the school day and to that end went to see some of estonias hobby schools free afterschool clubs that support childrens education and offer parents flexibility if they have to work late we need a system that better reflects the needs of modern families and the way they live their lives now she told the guardian during her visit to estonia i dont think you can talk about growing your economy unless youve got a childcare system that supports parents its clear to me that we need to see a real transformation in the early education and childcare thats available to parents thats brought together in one system that provides seamless support from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school crucially labour is looking to plug the gap between the end of parental leave and the start of the hours of free childcare which kicks in for working parents once a child is three there is for most families no support offered yet most women want to be able to work when theyve reached the end of their parental leave said phillipson increasingly and the numbers do bear this out they are giving up in bigger numbers because there is no government contribution during this time that has to change it will be a big priority for me she said highquality early years education was clearly beneficial for children from disadvantaged backgrounds but stressed that she wanted labours offer to benefit all parents including many professional parents who find that the cost is crippling for now all policy development comes with a health warning that until labour knows the state of the public finances it is impossible to make firm promises policymakers are however looking at repurposing some of the money already in what is currently a fragmented and unwieldy childcare system maintained nursery schools provide statefunded childcare up to the age of five and often include dedicated provision for special needs or disabilities they are run like schools and are the closest thing to the estonian kindergarten in the english system but only of them survive in england because of the high cost involved labours plan to grow the sector will remove barriers in current legislation that prevent local authorities from establishing new childcare provision other than where they can demonstrate there is no other provider who could deliver we would like to expand this element of the sector but its very much direction of travel and would not happen overnight said one source

the other night i was bathing my monthold son he grabbed the shampoo bottles the rubber duck and a hairbrush and sank them in the bathwater he squealed delighting himself in some private game i turned away picked up my phone refreshed my email and checked instagram then i scrolled while my son played in the bath beside me thinking he didnt want to be observed when he noticed me on my phone looking away from him his smile vanished he whined and teared up i immediately put the phone down cooing im sorry baby im sorry but he cried unforgivingly my wife hearing the commotion came into the bathroom picked him up in a towel and carried him into his bedroom i followed behind still apologising he scowled at me hes upset because you werent paying attention my wife said im sorry baby why couldnt i be present with my son what was i looking for on my phone i dont think i have clearly established the boundaries between myself and my phone or looked closely enough at the specific unthinking ways the phone is taking me away from connecting with the people that matter my son relies on me to be there for him he looks to me as a model of appropriate behaviour and to be present for him shaming myself or falling on negative selftalk is not what i want to do here i want to acknowledge that i dont like the relationship i have with my phone and i want it to change yes i know me and everyone else but what am i actually doing about it and how deeply am i interrogating my impulse i know that some incredibly smart people came up with the technology and our addiction is an intended effect but i dont want to deliver a critique of the tech industry i just want to articulate the emotional impact that scrolling has had on me i have begun to talk a lot more about my social media usage in therapy my counsellor wonders if im partly checking out as a coping mechanism because of the exhaustion of being deaf in the hearing world straining to hear all day i fall back on scrolling because it feels like a sedative and it relaxes me while also keeping me numbingly alert on the screen where all the content i passively consume is subtitled it seems most of us get into a social media slump when were tired and zoning out this makes sense but can only be part of the story yes were collectively glued to our phones dulling the most alive parts of ourselves as jenny odell describes it in her book how to do nothing resisting the attention economy but now im trying to unpick my relationship with social media with a healthcare professional i wonder what parts of myself i might discover or rediscover without social media getting in the way this evening i bathed my son while trying not to impulsively switch off and turn away im trying to stay available to witness him quietly playing i felt the urge to check my phone and rode out the feeling and was glad to have created a moment with him he has nine teeth and light hazelnut hair his curls fall not far from his eyes which are his mothers eyes i hope to push through the precipice of more of those feelings next year i want to become more intentional with my attention and ive already disabled my twitter account most people i have spoken to who are still on it claim to be there to watch it burn but one week away and my screen time has dropped ive got more reading done and im keeping the phone out of the bathroom and bedroom i get a little private kick out of achieving this almost every conversation i have with people about social media seems generalised and cliched that they have been doom scrolling and getting dumber every minute they spend on their phones i know its an obvious observation but there are things that need to be said repeatedly messages that deserve the ubiquity of prayers and stevie wonder songs the message is are you being mindful in this way i am not just thinking of what i model for my son but what he models for me if i notice it if i look closer to see how gently present he is when he is playing i want to keep him safe in my gaze i want to be conscious of the part of me that is refusing to be immersed and alive in unplugged ways so i can create moments that deepen our breath and connect us more intimately than air,2022-12,night wa bathing monthold son grabbed shampoo bottle rubber duck hairbrush sank bathwater squealed delighting private game turned away picked phone refreshed email checked

lately ive been feeling disconnected from my friends which is strange as i speak to them all the time when i say speak i mean we send messages to each other on whatsapp i hear their voices when they send voice notes but mostly we type whatsapp is indisputably convenient free to use intuitive immediate and when it comes to group chats with friends collective fun a brief scan of my recent chats reveals a copious amount of memes a photo of my friends new sixpack a rant about someone on telly an exchange of photos of cold sores a pet video a podcast recommendation and yet another attempt to arrange a gettogether i am in two whatsapp groups that function solely to try to organise an irl meetup which never happens at least we have whatsapp whatsapp has managed to commandeer every connection i have in my life from my yearold mother to the woman who shapes and tints my brows thanks to the app i can find out in seconds that its nonuniform day at my kids school that im supposed to be on a zoom call or that beyonc has a new single out i can send a voice note to my management team explaining something on the fly while im dragging my children home from school i can get the lowdown on a night out with a group of friends via voices notes and text covering eight different perspectives of one room but if i wanted more perspectives thats available too this year the app increased the limit of people allowed in a whatsapp group chat from to people and then to just in case you needed to organise a rally or a rave unsurprisingly there are downsides to whatsapp according to a study having lots of chats on the go and a high sensitivity to read receipts can be linked with negative psychological consequences how does a messaging app ensure that its users always come back by making sure the chats never end now i have all my notifications turned off i use my mute button regularly i control the app it doesnt control me so why do i feel as if whatsapp is at the heart of this feeling of disconnection from my friends in this past year i have allowed whatsapp chats to replace realtime conversations instead of thinking of a friend and picking up the phone to call them i open a whatsapp chat and send a quick hi babe how was your weekend i tell myself it doesnt take up their time its there as and when theyre ready to reply and so begins a two or threedaylong saga of suspended initiations and anticipated replies over the course of the interaction depending on how many other things we are doing at the time our replies become rushed and scrappy and eventually nonexistent until one of us starts another one i have lost count of the chats that i have started or joined in enthusiastically only to then be distracted by work or family and forget to reply i hate the thought that i have left my friends hanging in the digital ether waiting for me to get back to them and i hate being the one left hanging slowly because of this neverending nature of whatsapp messaging this conversation i started with someone i love becomes a chore its like only being allowed to eat nibbles for two days straight no hungry person is satiated with nibbles in that creeping insidious way that tech has of influencing our behaviour whatsapp has become allconsuming when it first arrived i didnt have a burning desire to replace my realtime phone conversations with texted chats i didnt feel as though i was spending too much time on the phone speaking to my friends i miss those conversations now so for next year i want to bring back something that i used to do as a regular part of my day every time i go to initiate a chat with a friend on whatsapp i will phone them instead even if its a rushed and short conversation ill take it im hoping for a beginning a middle and an end to say goodbye and have it reciprocated some revelations some belly laughs and when i get the opportunity to have a long meandering conversation where we talk about life and figure things out together im hoping to feel filled up nourished and energised just like after a good meal the whatsapp chats will still happen but they wont forsake reallife conversations with the people i love no more nibbles i want a big feed and an empty plate,2022-12,lately ive feeling disconnected friend strange speak time say speak mean send message whatsapp hear voice send voice note mostly type whatsapp

a consequence of socialising with family and friend groups at christmas is the frontrow seat we all get to other peoples parenting or the ew is that how youre going to do it subcategory of entertainment this year judgment is likely to fall on where you stand in relation to the most popular new school of parenting its called gentle parenting or childcentred parenting or sometimes childled parenting and in outline it doesnt sound bad where i live in new york its the dominant approach among parents of young children where the air is busy with identifiable phrases you seem to be frustrated why is that says a mother to her toddler as he screams and refuses to leave the playground or i hear that youre hurting right now delivered to a bellowing child who just kicked another childs shin the harshest line youll hear in this vein is a softly intoned thats not ok childcentred parenting has been around for years but only now is it starting to yield young adult graduates it a correction of sorts both to the highintensity helicopter parenting of years ago and to the more authoritarian approach of all parenting prior to that in childcentred parenting shouting at your child is not only counterproductive its damaging ditto forcing your child into schedules and structures that appear to suit you not them praise meanwhile the ubiquitous american good job issued to a child for every action that rises above the level of breathing is considered as ruinous as excessive criticism the child who is told youre so good at this is in the gentle parenting schema shoehorned into a competitive mindset in which conquering a task is more important than taking pleasure in it the better approach it is said in countless podcasts and newsletters is to offer neutral commentary along the lines of you really enjoyed that to which my response is i mean i guess ive tried some of these things and some of them feel good and some of them work being given permission not to helicopter your kids schedule is definitely a win as is the invitation to worry less about tailoring them into little einsteins for snobbish reasons ive always slightly been drawn to those romantic memoirs of posh english people in which they write about the benign neglect of ranging around the stately home enjoying rousseaulevels of freedom on the other hand i dont think thats what this is in some iterations childcentred parenting simply seems to be another form of neurotic engagement in which rather than telling the child what to do the parent stands off to one side quietly fussing internally while issuing occasional ineffectual validations the point is that there can be as much sly proscription in the idea of letting your child take the lead as there is in devising a rigid structure for them and the potential downsides it seems to me are considerable some of this is aesthetic at the trivial end you can buy framed posters on etsy memorialising phrases such as excuse the mess were making memories of living in chaos some popular phrases from childled schools of thought cut so aggressively against the grain that i die of embarrassment just uttering them when i roadtested the you really enjoyed that line on my daughter whod just done a painting she gave me her whatiswrongwithyou look i cleared my throat and ploughed on it doesnt matter if its good or not its just whether you enjoyed it are you saying its not good she replied because i think its amazing i said no i totally think its amazing the childs a genius who am i kidding what sits oddly here this isnt quite the right phrasing but is as close as i can get is pretending to be someone else while parenting it seems less than ideal to switch into a weird whispery mode of condescension every time you talk to your child officially childcentred parenting aims to treat children like miniadults which means to dignify their emotions by taking them seriously but to state the obvious if im waiting for another adult while they fanny about not putting their coat on i wont be reaching for the line you seem frustrated how can i help instead i will say stop dicking about were going to be late a tone that in this mindset youre not allowed to take with a child i once heard a friend with a sixyearold get around the gentleparenting rules by saying to the son whod just kicked her you are acting like someone who is acting like a jerk an amazing piece of sophistry deployed to avoid what were told is the ruinous harm of direct confrontation there are times when aspects of the childled approach sound like nothing so much as stepford wife parenting soft tones disguising sublimated rage i dont know im sure less yelling is a good thing but some yelling is fine and even necessary im sure theres a magic line between overvalidation and dismissal childcentred parenting is supposed to turn out confident kids but taken to extremes it turns out kids who may be so destabilised when another child confronts challenges or proves unmindful of their feelings that they lose the plot every time they go out various studies of the past few years have sought to identify links between parental overprotection and excessive risk control with narcissism in young adults on a less scientific level constantly saying your childs feelings back to them strikes me as vaguely creepy and controlling the best version of this is i think tactical when one of my children starts faffing about a minute before we have to leave for school its an invitation to be challenged which will permit her to escalate and waste more time the only successful approach in this case is to give her nothing no reprimand no attention no are you feeling frustrated nothing very soon the faffing deprived of oxygen dies out i understand that she would like another minutes at home and i also understand that like all children she is wanting to feel where the boundary is the boundary is my crossed arms and sour face as parents most of us are clearly overthinking it are you sure you dont just need to eat a banana i will say when one of my children kicks off it infuriates them it invalidates their feelings it makes them feel dismissed until they

how should we refer to the children of immigrants the traditional answer is secondgeneration immigrants yet firstgeneration locals is far more accurate as a new research paper coauthored by alan manning one of the uks top economists points out it has more to offer than linguistic improvements in the us firstgeneration locals generally do better than the children of locals but thats prompted a puzzle because in european countries that is often not the case with the children of migrants having below average educational and labour market outcomes this has prompted worries from the left about discrimination and from the right about a lack of integration the new paper focuses on denmark tracking children born in the s over four decades to see what has become of them aged among them people whose parents were born outside denmark this confirms the bad news firstgeneration locals have worse outcomes in a wide range of areas on average earning around less than those with two localborn parents but does this mean that being a firstgeneration local is causing this disadvantage here comes the important bit because when the economists go on to compare those whose parents had similar socioeconomic backgrounds education jobs income firstgeneration locals actually earn more than those with localborn parents mirroring what we see in the us this is far from just of academic interest almost million ukborn children have two migrant parents and they generally face higher rates of deprivation so the key issue for firstgeneration locals isnt that their parents are migrants its that they are often poor torsten bell is chief executive of the resolution foundation read more at resolutionfoundationorg do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article if you would like to submit a letter of up to words to be considered for publication email it to us at observerlettersobservercouk,2022-12,refer child immigrant traditional answer secondgeneration immigrant yet firstgeneration local far accurate new research paper coauthored alan manning one uk top economist point ha offer linguistic improvement u firstgeneration local generally better child local thats prompted puzzle european country often case child migrant average educational labour market outcome ha prompted worry left discrimination right lack integration new paper focus denmark tracking child born four decade see ha become aged among people whose parent born outside denmark confirms bad news firstgeneration local worse outcome wide range area average earning around less two localborn parent doe mean firstgeneration local causing disadvantage come important bit economist go compare whose parent similar socioeconomic background education job income firstgeneration local actually earn localborn parent mirroring see u far academic interest almost million ukborn child two migrant parent generally face higher rate deprivation key issue firstgeneration local isnt parent migrant often poor torsten bell chief executive resolution foundation read resolutionfoundationorg opinion issue raised article would like submit letter word considered publication email u observerlettersobservercouk,"['refer', 'child', 'immigrant', 'traditional', 'answer', 'secondgeneration', 'immigrant', 'yet', 'firstgeneration', 'local', 'far', 'accurate', 'new', 'research', 'paper', 'coauthored', 'alan', 'manning', 'one', 'uk', 'top', 'economist', 'point', 'ha', 'offer', 'linguistic', 'improvement', 'u', 'firstgeneration', 'local', 'generally', 'better', 'child', 'local', 'thats', 'prompted', 'puzzle', 'european', 'country', 'often', 'case', 'child', 'migrant', 'average', 'educational', 'labour', 'market', 'outcome', 'ha', 'prompted', 'worry', 'left', 'discrimination', 'right', 'lack', 'integration', 'new', 'paper', 'focus', 'denmark', 'tracking', 'child', 'born', 'four', 'decade', 'see', 'ha', 'become', 'aged', 'among', 'people', 'whose', 'parent', 'born', 'outside', 'denmark', 'confirms', 'bad', 'news', 'firstgeneration', 'local', 'worse', 'outcome', 'wide', 'range', 'area', 'average', 'earning', 'around', 'less', 'two', 'localborn', 'parent', 'doe', 'mean', 'firstgeneration', 'local', 'causing', 'disadvantage', 'come', 'important', 'bit', 'economist', 'go', 'compare', 'whose', 'parent', 'similar', 'socioeconomic', 'background', 'education', 'job', 'income', 'firstgeneration', 'local', 'actually', 'earn', 'localborn', 'parent', 'mirroring', 'see', 'u', 'far', 'academic', 'interest', 'almost', 'million', 'ukborn', 'child', 'two', 'migrant', 'parent', 'generally', 'face', 'higher', 'rate', 'deprivation', 'key', 'issue', 'firstgeneration', 'local', 'isnt', 'parent', 'migrant', 'often', 'poor', 'torsten', 'bell', 'chief', 'executive', 'resolution', 'foundation', 'read', 'resolutionfoundationorg', 'opinion', 'issue', 'raised', 'article', 'would', 'like', 'submit', 'letter', 'word', 'considered', 'publication', 'email', 'u', 'observerlettersobservercouk']",42
ministers have backed down in the face of a crossparty push for childcare to be treated as an infrastructure issue like schools gps and public transport meaning major housebuilders could be obliged to pay towards new childcare facilities the campaign was led by the labour mp stella creasy who argued that the issue of new homes being built without accompanying childcare was exacerbating a national shortfall in provision that has resulted in prices rising to levels unaffordable for many parents ending a commons debate on the levellingup and regeneration bill the levelling up minister lucy frazer said the government now accepted that childcare fell under the formal definition of infrastructure this means childcare provision will qualify for money from a local infrastructure levy which can be imposed on developers who are building new housing the position is that childcare facilities that is buildings including those that are not attached to schools are included within the meaning of infrastructure and they can therefore be funded through the levy frazer told mps in addition to that there is the power in the bill already to regulate to allow for funding of services such as childcare creasy had tabled an amendment to the levellingup and regeneration bill which was in the commons on tuesday for the final part of its committee stage her amendment was signed by mps from four parties including several conservatives one of the tory mps was robin walker a former education minister who now chairs the education select committee creasy hailed the change of stance and pulled her amendment but warned she would be watchful to see whether new money materialised we have finally dragged the government into accepting that childcare is part of infrastructure and should be funded by local councils if they want to do so she said now we need to make sure they dont renege on the money desperately needed so that parents as well as potholes get the investment our economy needs walker speaking in the commons told frazer he also welcomed the government move saying the levelling up bill could also reflect results from an upcoming inquiry into childcare by the education select committee inquiry when it goes through the lords research carried out in support of creasys plan had shown that since in of english local authorities the rate of population growth was greater than the growth of the childcare sector this included of the areas with the highest population growth a shortage of childcare places has exacerbated other inflationary pressures with the cost of

committee research carried out in support of the plan shows that since in of english local authorities the rate of population growth was greater than the growth of the childcare sector this included of the areas with the highest population growth in a total of areas the number of available childcare places had actually fallen since while the populations had increased a shortage of childcare places has exacerbated other inflationary pressures with the cost of provision forecast to go up by as much as next year prompting many parents to reduce how much childcare they use or even give up work another issue is underfunding of the governments pledge for free hours of childcare for three and fouryearolds meaning nurseries have to crosssubsidise this by increasing overall fees in a guardian callout to those affected by the issue people said they were spending more on nursery fees than on their mortgage or that their wages barely covered their childcare bill creasy said the crisis in our childcare system is holding back children and holding back our economy a decade of underinvestment in these services has led to eyewatering prices and unsustainable waiting lists to get your child into nursery it is time we recognised childcare as the vital economic infrastructure it is without highquality affordable childcare we will continue to see parents locked out of work for

the uk has some of the highest childcare costs in the world increasingly forcing women out of the workplace i asked christine farquharson from the institute of fiscal studies why being a woman in her s id rank childcare costs before bloating but after climate in the list of routinely discussed horrors its hard to make sense of looking after young children is expensive in the uk we have a childcare ratio of one adult to a maximum of three undertwos if you divide the minimum wage an hour for overs by three youre looking at north of an hour per child its labourintensive and that makes it expensive then add rent energy etc and other countries dont have those ratios they do but the ratios for younger children one and twoyearolds arent as tight surely then its a case of getting rid of the ratios wait did i just solve the crisis go me elect me at this point youre probably on track to be our sixth secretary of state for education in five months ratios merit investigation but childcare providers already struggle to get staff and talking about having four kids instead of three makes that person on minimum wages job harder in your recent report on childcare you identified a broad range of costs from a week to why the variation some families are paying an arm and a leg but they are disproportionately middle to highearners where both parents are working fulltime in london and the southeast and using formal childcare intensively for very young children strip away those factors and a lot of families arent using formal childcare for their one and twoyearolds much thats not to say those families wouldnt like to if it were cheaper but only of families say theyre struggling with fees couldnt there be a sliding scale so the highest earners pay more while the squeezed get a bit of relief well its possible wahey solved it again so why is childcare rising faster than inflation one thing that comes up a lot is the unintended consequences of policy what youre talking about is specific to one and twoyearolds in parttime nursery places if youre a parent of a three or fouryearold your costs have gone down dramatically because since you started to get access to hours a week of funded childcare but is the funding enough if it isnt providers will say im going to put up rates on children who arent under the government umbrella what a mess oneyearolds subsiding threeyearolds also childcare staff really need to be paid more at least theres political momentum now its on the agenda the and manifestos of labour and the liberal democrats had commitments but the introduction of the hour entitlement has come at the cost of a much less generous taxfree childcare scheme and much less spending through the benefit system squeezing lowincome working parents and the more the government says were going to deliver funded childcare the more it starts to feel like a new branch of the welfare state that would be a political lightning rod this is why i could never be a politician the grubbiness of tradeoffs oh come on youve just done all sorts of issuesolving,2022-12,uk ha highest childcare cost world increasingly forcing woman workplace asked christine farquharson institute

parents who are already struggling with soaring childcare costs have expressed horror after being told their fees are to go up again in the new year by as much as as nurseries across the country try to cover their own rising costs letters and emails have been sent out by childcare providers informing parents of the latest price hikes as a result some are considering reducing their childcare pulling their children out giving up work or even leaving the country to find cheaper childcare abroad parents who responded to a guardian callout said they were already spending more on nursery fees than on their mortgage others said their salary barely covers their childcare bill as inflationary pressures drive up providers costs katie a charity sector worker in bath whose nursery fees for her twoyearold will go up in january with an increase of a day to said its not unexpected but just adds to the already extremely high cost at the moment the crisis in early years recruitment makes us grateful to even have a space another nursery in the area has given notice to families because of staff shortages while another has reduced hours at short notice a father in leicester said childcare costs for his daughter went up by in april and will now be going up another in january our threeyearold is only two days in nursery but is now costing more than a month sarah an office worker from somerset said it just makes me feel sick our electric bill has just ticked over in to a higher rate already fuel and food bills are soaring then the nursery fee goes up i have no spare cash at the end of the month my son is months old before he was born i had a good paying job and was living comfortably from when i started looking at nurseries to starting the fee went up and four months later its gone up again where is the help for people that want to work meanwhile a father working in financial services in london said nursery costs for his oneyearold daughter who is in full day care would go up an eyewatering in january increasing from to a month most respondents who contacted the guardian were sympathetic to childcare providers who are seeing their own costs rise with soaring inflation and many blamed underfunding of the governments hour childcare provision for three and fouryearolds which means nurseries have to crosssubsidise free hours by increasing their overall fees heather a solicitor in leeds said her twoyearold daughter had been going to a local private nursery for just over a year in that time there has been one price increase of last january and we have just been informed that fees will go up again in the coming january by we were expecting it to be high because nurseries are experiencing the same cost increases as everyone else the government is not increasing early years funding in line with inflation so no wonder nurseries are struggling i had my baby fully expecting to pay good money for her to be educated and looked after while i go to work so im not about to complain about fees going up its the best value for money purchase i make every month and worth every penny jeremy hunts autumn statement last month made no mention of childcare but as fees go up and childcare providers go under it is likely to become a key election issue ashley fryer from kingston upon thames who is head of media at a national charity and has an monthold and a fouryearold will see her childcare bill go up from january my husband and i have decent salaries but saving any money every month is impossible given our fees are over a month and thats before the increase philippa mullen a parttime civil servant and mother of two nurseryaged children said since her son started nursery in january fees have gone up four times but she is yet to receive a pay rise the whole setup is diabolical working mums in particular are being forced out of work i dont have any disposable income whatsoever the only reason im working is for my pension contribution and to keep a foot in the industry a university administrator said his nursery has just announced price increases for the new year from to a week the second increase in recent months it may get to the point where it actually becomes cheaper for one of us to quit their job and look after the child we are also considering how feasible it would be to leave this country and move to another where childcare is free it may actually be a more viable option than remaining in the uk which is frankly depressing purnima tanuku chief executive of the national day nurseries association ndna said we know nurseries and childcare settings are working hard to keep fee increases down but the government has put early years providers in an impossible situation by not paying its fair share a government spokesperson said the government had spent more than bn over the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare and had set out plans to help providers run their businesses more flexibly we know many households and childcare providers are facing pressures from recession and high inflation improving the cost choice and availability of highquality childcare for working parents is important for this government they said case studies irene muma from grays in essex works fulltime as an hr business partner but is planning to reduce the number of days her twoyearold son is at nursery to cut costs as a firsttime mum i am feeling the impact of the extreme childcare costs my sons childcare costs more than my mortgage and half of my pay goes on childcare the nursery fees went up in september from a day to i am at a stage where i will need to reduce my sons days at nursery and cut down my hours to care for my son this is not my choice rather as a consequence of the costs of childcare as a family we are unable to save sufficiently and we are seeing a reduced standard of living i am in a constant state of anxiety and stress because my career is just as important as being a mum i shouldnt have to choose either or the combination of high childcare costs and cost of living crisis is really impacting my mental health and i know a lot of mothers are going through the same struggle amanda sheriff who owns little hubbers day nursery in north shields is putting up her fees by just over next april in order to stay afloat yes fees are going up the national minimum wage increase alone means

i bought a book for my mother and the baby to read together i love my granny talks about her comfy tummy and the fact that she has lived for ages and has loads of time on her hands which frankly i find a bit rude nevertheless it speaks to the loving and caring role that a grandparent can have in a childs life seeing my baby bond with his grandparents has been one of the most rewarding aspects of being a parent so far the uks broken childcare system means that grandparents often have to step in to offer help with one study finding that offer some kind of support when it comes to looking after grandchildren my parents are no different my mum especially has been very present these past months while my dad and stepmum the babys nain and taid welsh words for grandmother and grandfather practically begged to take him so we could swim in the sea and go out for dinner his paternal grandparents have cared for his many cousins who live locally to them i must say im relieved that the baby has finally got a nursery place as ive been feeling guilty about the amount of childcare my newly retired mum has been helping us with im incredibly grateful and ive treated her to a posh spa day to mark her retirement and to say thank you as well as covering her trains she lives up north she adores the baby and loves being with him and he loves his nonna so its not all toil nevertheless it doesnt feel great that after decades of caring for my brother who is autistic and me she is now taking on more labour just as she should be able to relax i also feel guilty that she has been spending nights on the sofa and that she caught covid from us when she came to help i owe her a great debt for sharing her time wisdom and experience with my new little family im not the only one who feels guilty one mother of a oneyearold tells me she has had to draft her mum in two days a week due to a lack of nursery spaces it was that she says or resign i feel so guilty about the whole situation even though its not really my fault she writes its such a burden on my mum she is relatively young but its not fair to take up so much of her time with the slog of everyday childcare rather than her being able to savour special moments with my daughter at her convenience and leisure it goes without saying that my mum is doing this all unpaid and wouldnt accept it if we offered to be honest the fact that it is unpaid also means we can actually afford for me to be at work of course theres a difference between gratefully and guiltily accepting freely given offers of help and feeling entitled to it one of the most bemusing aspects of the comedy series motherland is the level of entitlement that stressed mum julia the protagonist feels towards her mother not to mention her mothers indifference to her grandchildren furthermore the close parentchildgrandchild relationships that many of us treasure are not everyones experience and geography is a huge factor and what of grandfathers its largely grandmothers who do the bulk of the caring and i wonder if the sense of entitlement some parents feel to their labour can be blamed on tradition throughout human history grandmothers played a large role in the upbringing of children especially in workingclass families where the mother was needed for paid work outside the home can we blame some of our mothers generation of secondwave feminists for resisting that or for wondering when exactly the hard physically demanding work will stop there are of course handson grandfathers my dad is one a man comfortable with all aspects of childcare my dad and i joke that hes the worlds best grandpa or an average grandma another mum who has a threeyearold autistic son and a young baby tells me my mum passed away years before i had children and my inlaws live further away so i am very grateful hes stepped up and the relationship he has with his grandson is so beautiful her sons autism has made childcare difficult so her dad does two afternoons a week my dads always been good with toddlers and babies hes great at story time can really make them laugh and talks to them like little adults which they always appreciate she says but he wasnt much for practical stuff he didnt really change nappies for me and my siblings when we were babies and hadnt changed any for my son until we discussed the idea of him helping out when i went back to work as well as all the handson help its lovely to read about the joy that grandchildren can bring to their grandparents take this recent comment beneath my column from a grandfather i have largely brought up my granddaughter from the age of less than a week in my s i am quite capable of changing nappies feeding wiping up enormous

free universal preschool childcare and more funding for afterschool clubs could increase government revenues and save a family with young children between and a year a joint report welcomed by the labour party has revealed the institute for public policy research ippr and the charity save the children have called for a universal childcare guarantee for all families until the end of primary school to allow more women to get back into work and reduce the attainment gap between rich and poor children in their early years parents have been pushed out of work as they cannot afford to pay for rising childcare costs as many schools do not have the funds or staff to hold breakfast or afterschool clubs the ippr has previously argued that higher childcare costs as parents increase their hours creates a tax on workers but ensuring households can access affordable childcare could slash nearly bn from government social security spending as more families could move into work or increase their hours rebecca from norfolk lost a job because she couldnt afford to work fulltime and pay for childcare she cannot claim universal credit to cover her babysitter costs because of a shortage of ofstedregistered babysitters in her area i do four jobs to fit in around my yearold daughter its really shocking i tried to work fulltime for five months but it got to the summer holidays and i couldnt come in fulltime the fulltime wage was less than the cost of fulltime childcare if breakfast and afterschool clubs were properly funded and were reliable i could get a real job working nine to five every day and earn real money it would be amazing yes it might be expensive but it costs them so much money having people out of work and costs them so much having people sick from overworking she added the report sets out steps for the government to adopt that will eventually boost economic growth starting with increasing funding for free hours of childcare and extending an offer of hours to all three and fouryearolds other steps include extending free hours to all twoyearolds with eligibility beginning from the end of paid parental leave increasing funded hours for twoyearolds and under twoyearolds extending wraparound care from am to pm to more schools and offering a variety of afterschool activities through term time the labour party has previously adopted policies from the thinktank bridget phillipson the shadow education secretary endorsed the report and said this detailed and thorough report is further evidence that the time has come for a new modern childcare system which would improve lives for every family labour will deliver a new system to give children the best start in life and parents choices enabling them to get back into work or to increase their hours and give our economy the growth we need becca lyon head of child poverty at save the children said parents we speak to regardless of their income are crying out for the childcare system to change if made a reality a universal childcare guarantee would be lifechanging for families creating an easytouse childcare payment system for all dramatically cutting childcare costs ensuring the nurseries their children love are properly funded and providing free breakfast and afterschool clubs when children are older a government spokesperson said we know many households and childcare providers are facing pressures from recession and high inflation improving the cost choice and availability of highquality childcare for working parents is important for this government we have spent more than bn over the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare and the number of places available in england has remained stable since with thousands of parents benefiting from this support

the question i have immense trouble maintaining female friendships i grew up with three older brothers have a whole bunch of great longstanding friendships with men and a few friendships with women from back in the day but we dont live near each other now every woman ive ever befriended since childhood ends up ghosting me ive been racking my brain about why these female friendships always fizzle out i dont think ive done anything wrong that would justify ditching me in fact i have supported these women over the years when theyve been in tricky situations i spoke to a male friend recently and he said that the women who have cut me off didnt have all the things i have children money a rich husband a successful career and a good lifestyle i was shocked that envy may be the reason these friendships have failed i have high expectations for myself and have views about female independence but have never commented negatively on my friends lives i have sought to encourage them and told them how clever attractive and funny they are i dont know what i can do differently can female friendships only function between absolute equals do i need to hide my success to maintain friendships with women philippas answer whatever is happening it is doing so outside your consciousness it might be of temporary comfort were i to say its not you its them but as this keeps on happening i do think it is probably you you arent doing anything wrong intentionally and if you can do some detective work to find out what it is maybe there can be change a lot of people find relationships with one sex more difficult than with those of the other in therapy if their problem is with women i ask such clients to tell me how they experienced their relationship with their mother or their father if men are the issue sometimes we can learn whether that relationship became a blueprint for subsequent relationships we often find an early coping strategy or core belief which helped someone survive childhood might be holding them back in adulthood maybe you have some unhelpful beliefs about friendship that you may have needed in order to get along with your brothers dont add to these beliefs with yet another about equals and envy human interactions are complex and cannot be reduced to clichs about either gender if i envy a friend who has something id love to have in my case grandchildren or a kitchen island it doesnt make me want to ghost them im more likely to want to hang around that island and play with those children i might fade away from someones life if they made me feel i was lacking as a person its unlikely to be envy that keeps women away but it might be that you somehow make others feel inferior remember people are neither their jobs their relationships their possessions nor their children they are valuable and equal whatever they have or havent got from early on we pick up the clichd folklore that girls gossip bitch and are weak while boys are straightforward and strong both girls and boys internalise these messages society seems to value men more so as a girl if you are said to be one of the boys it can be felt as a compliment and make you feel superior to other girls it might also be possible that as the only girl among three boys you may have fallen into thinking of yourself as special which doesnt go down well with other women the way you described helping women friends didnt come across to me like it was the usual twoway exchange of mutual support im not getting a sense of your sharing your own vulnerabilities with others which is usually a part of close friendships you may be coming across as somehow saying be like i am have my attitude then youll have what i have other people may hear this as dont be you be me it is rare that someone wants to be fixed by a friend instead we usually want to be understood maybe you can accept men as they are but seem to think that women need to change or maybe you automatically unknowingly seek out female friends to whom you can feel superior some internalised misogyny might be being sensed by others whatever it is that is happening to cause your problem it is likely the result of your early environment weve all soaked up stories where most protagonists are men and most women are at best sidekicks no wonder there is unconscious bias that interferes with the way we relate recently i peeled back a few more layers of my own unconscious bias on reading the novel a thousand ships by natalie haynes to understand a female perspective in a deeper way i would recommend reading more fiction by women another way to increase selfawareness would be to try a womens therapy group the feedback just might be invaluable groupanalysisorg if you have a question send a brief
