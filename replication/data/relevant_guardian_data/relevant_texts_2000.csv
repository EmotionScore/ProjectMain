the government yesterday hit back over claims that children of working mothers suffer academically and insisted it was taking steps to help parents balance work and home life the employment and equal opportunities minister margaret hodge rejected suggestions made in last nights panorama programme that children of preschool age whose mothers work later achieve worse reading scores ministers have also been stung by a study for the same programme indicating onethird of mothers are forced out of fulltime working with many blaming inflexible employers for failing to allow them necessary time off work those findings gave ammunition to campaigners including trade unions who while backing the governments pledge to give mothers who want to work new choices insist that it has so far done too little to compel employers to help women return to the workplace they will also be taken up by critics who argue tony blairs administration is seeking to force mothers back into employment ms hodge rejected a study by professor heather joshi of the institute of education which suggested children were around a tenth less likely to advance one academic stage if their mothers worked during their preschool years she said this research is based on a time when nobody thought about childcare as a national issue we now know perfectly well that it is choice and quality of childcare which are crucial to childrens academic outcomes the government faces more pressure to make a reality of promises to improve homelife balance for employees from the tuc and other pressure groups they are are urging legislation to ensure employers offer parents real choices to allow them to return to work ms hodge yesterday announced the creation of an advisory committee whose members include former

a third of working mothers are quitting fulltime jobs for parttime positions or giving up work altogether a survey reveals today with many women blaming inflexible employers who refuse to allow them time off to look after their children the research carried out for the bbcs panorama programme undermines government initiatives which are aimed at encouraging women who have had children to return to the workforce researchers at the university of bristol who analysed the working patterns of mothers found that they all returned to work fulltime after the birth of their first child but within two years more than a third had given up their fulltime positions with switching to parttime employment and giving up work altogether the programme makers also commissioned a smallerscale study of mothers taken from the ongoing british household panel survey which examined the reasons why such a high proportion of mothers are leaving fulltime work susan harkness of the university of sussex who carried out the research said i think we tended to assume that those women whod come back to work after childbirth stay in the labour market so the scale of the dropout was really quite surprising we found that women who returned to fulltime work tended to do so when their children were very young we also found they worked very long hours there was no reduction in hours prior to and after the birth of the child so there was no accommodation within their jobs to account for the fact they now had responsibilities for a very young child one of the women interviewed was cathy schofield who gave up her job as marketing director for a publishing firm in order to be able to spend more time with her son i didnt think i would find myself not exactly being hounded out of work but having my working day made so guiltridden that i just couldnt bear to carry on the publishing company insist they were accommodating but ms schofield says her boss complained when her son was ill saying he seemed to be ill more often than other children and when she stayed at home to deal with an emergency her holiday allowance was docked penny gillison a new mother has been trying to negotiate flexible working hours with her boss to cope with looking after her child you always have this feeling that someones saying in the background oh youre a terrible mother how dare you work i have no choice at this point in time while encouraging mothers back into the workplace has become a key plank of government policy critics say much more needs to be done including legislation that would impose the legal right for new mothers to demand their old job back on a parttime basis however any such move would be fiercely opposed by employers ruth lea of the institute of directors said we did a survey months ago of our members and of them said that they would think twice about taking on women of prime childbearing age because of the maternity legislation the programme called back to the kitchen sink which will be broadcast at pm tonight on bbc also looks at the latest research into child development which appears to add weight to the controversial theory that young children whose parents work full time may perform less well at school professor heather joshi of the institute of education analysed several aspects of the lives of young adults who were born in the research found there was a link between a mothers employment in the preschool years and their childrens academic success the differences were small but meant that girls were less likely to advance one rung of the qualifications ladder such as the step between gcse and alevel while boys were less likely to do so the results follow the findings of the first part of the study released three months ago which reported that children whose mothers worked before they were one year old had slightly worse reading scores later on there may be something in the childs early development that equips them better to face these undoubted challenges of doing public exams professor joshi said however researchers believe of more significance may be the quality of childcare rather than simply the fact of having a working

for the first months of your childs life you want to be at home without chucking your career out of the window you are a parent working fulltime but you need to pick up your children from school or nursery each day you are bringing up children alone and if one of them is sick and off school you have no option but to skip work these are the daily dilemmas facing the average working parent but lets be honest when we say parent we really mean woman for despite a raft of family friendly government policies new technology and the emergence of a socalled softer management style women are still bearing the brunt of childcare responsibility and are forced into making unhappy compromises between home office and children traditionally family pressures have often dictated the type of work women undertake the secretarial sector has always attracted huge numbers of women not least because its hours have been relatively childfriendly but the dramatic change in the secretarial role combined with a fitter and faster workplace has conspired to make any job a juggling act of home and work pressures its not a joyful task a survey by lloydstsb revealed this month that in the last quarter of the th century working mothers were the most dissatisfied group of people in society thanks to the pressures of running a modern family wendy neusone who has a twoyear old son and works as a fulltime secretary for the legal department of the equal opportunities commission knows those pressures too well i set my standards quite high and i dont like to mention it if something goes wrong at home she says you do worry in case its looked on badly my husband is away on business a lot because he is a sales rep and although he helps where he can nine times out of ten the burden falls on me it can be a struggle to balance it all the government has changed the law to make it easier for women and especially lone parents to stay at work the working family tax credit allows eligible parents to claim up to of childcare costs but with the average yearly cost for two children in fulltime care around returning to work is still not economically feasible for many women earning middle or lower incomes campaigners argue that the only effective way to help working parents is to provide adequate childcare facilities but currently only one in ten employers offer any kind of help from creches to information service lines so what if you could pick and choose your working hours neusone for instance works flexitime which allows her to beat the rushhour traffic and pick up her son before pm when his nursery shuts flexibility is the latest buzzword and new patterns are attracting working parents since flexitime allows employees to choose within set limits the times they start and finish work parttime employment jobsharing and working from home are now protected by law and are attracting both men and women but many employers resist the idea of a more fluid and flexible workforce and workers in support roles are by definition often less free to design their own working schedules they often need to shadow the hours of their bosses who may be hostile to flexitime or jobshare initiatives for the employer its the continuity factor says ruth lea head of policy at the institute of directors employees have responsibilities as well as rights if youre a pa to a gogetting chap or woman youve got to be there she argues that recent legislation has only made it harder for women to break through the glass ceiling when we surveyed our members said they found women of childbearing age less attractive to employ than other groups basically youve got to make a hard choice the future is not female the truth is if you are talking about the workplace there are a lot of constrictions and limitations her assessment is shocking partly because it contrasts so sharply with the language of empowerment usually employed about working parents and instead of believing the workplace will become more familyfriendly she thinks the future will be surprisingly similar to the present childcare believes lea is entirely the responsibility of the worker when employers take people on they know about their family commitments but they expect them to be adult enough to be able to handle these pressures themselves its not up to us to do it that view was painfully illustrated last week when a city lawyer won her case for unfair dismissal after contending that her boss deliberately increased her workload when she first became pregnant and sacked her when she had her fourth child even though aisling sykes was prepared to take work home to carry on her hour day her employer jp morgan wanted her in the office having children sykes claimed was considered a lifestyle choice like playing squash if the sykes case is an exceptional example she was after all able to afford three fulltime nannies her dilemma does reflect a worrying trend merryn wells advice services manager for the equal opportunities commission tells the story of a pregnant pa who was forced to quit her job when she asked for a little compromise she used to work long hours but once she got pregnant she asked her employer if she could work her contractual hours am to pm basically the employer said no so she tried to work fulltime after the birth and could not cope she felt she had no choice but to resign carolyn jones director of the institute of employment rights is depressed by this climate i think back to when the former labour prime minister harold wilson talked about the white heat revolution of technology predicting it would bring more leisure and family time something has gone wrong today we are working longer hours for less pay and less leisure time she argues that a flexible workforce makes business sense if you adapt the workplace to the workers you get a more committed team because they are not spending most of their energy simply juggling their lives the culture and expectation is now about seeing the person as a whole and recognising their broader lifestyles some companies do take a progressive approach local authorities the nhs charities and it companies for example are known for their pragmatic approach to working practices at british telecom jobsharing is particularly common among its administrative staff the vast majority of whom are women in the next office one

the main difference in being old is that we can have a bit more leisure a bit more choice about what we do with ourselves we are given a precious last chance if only we can avoid poverty to cure ourselves of the pandemic hurry sickness before we subside into rest we even have a little time to experience education for educations sake not because it will qualify us for a more monied and a more hectic life but life cannot be given over entirely to the delights of nonvocational education and to relief from the pressures of a competitive market new pleasures are being combined with new duties particularly because ever increasing numbers of grandparents are becoming more involved with the rearing of grandchildren than they were and some are becoming active parents for a second time round the need is obvious marriage has become less popular divorce more so there are more and more single parents and above all more children in distress because their parents have broken apart some geneticists consider that women experience the menopause in order that they can assist in the survival of their descendants who are not their children but their grandchildren ample evidence for the growing modern practice comes not from britain but as so often from the us a report by the us census bureau last year showed that m grandparents live with their grandchildren and this does not include the millions more who are in one way or another caring for grandchildren without actually living with them out of the m grandparents m are raising them in their own home one million others are living with their grandchildren because they need to play an active part in supporting them climbing divorce rates teenage pregnancies and drug use are cited as the main reasons for grandparents being in a supportive role the us is fortunate in having a more impressive array of support groups than in britain there are between and active local grandparent groups which provide all manner of services for their members including representing them to the local authorities in addition there are strong grandparent lobbies at washington and in individual states the politically powerful american association of retired persons with more than m members is taking an interest in its grandparent members and more financial support is coming to those in poverty the part played by grandparents is generally respected and acknowledged in the us they are seen as an indispensable resource for children who would otherwise be parentless social workers in the us also hold the view distinct from their counterparts in britain that grandparents should be considered first although they are of course not always suitable as foster parents the old myth lingers in britain that if the parents have in some way failed it must be the fault of the grandparents in not bringing up their own children well enough creating a sort of guilt by association which is quite unjustified a recent report from the child welfare league of america spells out the advantages apart from avoiding the stigma of being a foster child for the children being cared for by relatives enabling children to live with persons whom they know and trust reducing the trauma children may experience when they are placed with persons who initially are unknown to them reinforcing childrens sense of identity and selfesteem facilitating childrens connections to their siblings encouraging families to consider and rely on their own family members as resources enhancing childrens opportunities to stay connected to their own communities and promoting community responsibility for children and families strengthening the ability of families to give children the support they need there are english exceptions of course in plymouth for example the city councils social services department has taken an interest one of their social workers david pitcher published a report in called when grandparents care he interviewed grandparents who had their grandchildren living with them after a case conference or court had found there was a risk of abuse as long as the child remained in the parental home it was not always easy going for the grandparents they did not have as much energy for rough and tumble and dealing with schools as when they were younger the grandchildren could be less respectful towards them and drugs and violence in the streets were common concerns but the comments were overwhelmingly favourable ranging from theyve kept me young to whatever price ive had to pay its been worth it in britain the first full study of grandparenting using a large representative sample has just been completed by geoff dench of the institute of community studies in conjunction with the national centre for social research the results show that the proportion of children living with grandparents is much lower in britain than in the us but in all sorts of other ways the grandparents of britain are doing a great deal for their grandchildren especially when the parental family is breaking up the evidence begs certain questions why grandparents are not paid when they step in in some instances giving up work to make caring possible and why do they get nothing extra for grandchild care even when the grandparents are on income support what we are seeing is a revival in the importance of the extended family this is going on alongside a vital change in its structure when studies of families in bethnal green in the east end of london were first being done in the s the extended family had a very large lateral extension some people had dozens even hundreds of relatives living locally married brothers and sisters and their nephews and nieces and all the inlaws children were surrounded by aunts and uncles and cousins of different degrees as fertility has continued to fall and families have become smaller the lateral has given way to the vertical more people live longer so there are more grandparents lasting longer and more greatgrandparents still alive the uncles and aunts have to some extent been replaced by the grandparents and when there are stepchildren the numbers of grandparents a child possesses can be more than four a new crossgenerational extended family is coming into existence this new kind of family pattern has profound consequences for the society of the new century alongside the more traditional family there will be growing numbers of grandparent grandchild families taking over from the parents who are bearers of the children many parentgrandparent agreements are made individually wherever both parties are willing parents might be working and have some freedom while they are still relatively young and not take on parental responsibilities until later meanwhile there is much that can be done by government if it is willing to support grandparents the children act of recognised that grandparents are family as a result some children who would otherwise be institutionalised in homes or placed with unrelated foster parents have been placed with grandparents instead but the policy is still very patchy a good deal has also been done to provide finance for childcare but although grandparents commonly act as child carers when their sons or daughters are working they cannot receive any allowance for all that they do even if they are on income support themselves there are hundreds of ridiculous anomalies for instance why should grandparents be unable to get help with travel expenses to visit children in prison when a host of other relatives are eligible the most important point to make about policy is about proximity grandparents cannot support parents effectively unless they live near each other housing policy has divided families millions of them since the war so that sons and daughters are rehoused all over the place without any consideration for links of kinship if some of the discrimination against grandparents were removed addressing the problem of splitting families geographically could be the beginning of a government policy which recognises the full role that grandparents play in the lives of their grandchildren michael young lord young of

times when it makes sense if your child is under the weather for example but well enough to sit quietly and read a book taking her into the office might mean you could do at least some of the work planned for that day also it can be nice for your children to see where you work so taking them in occasionally has its benefits my sixyearold is always asking me when she can come and see where i work its good that your kids can picture you when youre not around verdict yes julia drown a labour mp and mother of a fourmonthold baby i have been told by the sergeantatarms not to take my son into certain areas of the commons i am unhappy about this millions of women take their children to work because they have no choice if you need to return to work when youre breastfeeding though then having the baby at work is the most practical thing to do and its easier if there are childcare arrangements at work i can see its not a good idea to have babies in some parts of the commons but i dont think taking them into the tea rooms or voting chamber in an emergency would be a big problem verdict sometimes anna reece head of communications inst of personnel and development the working environment is rarely designed to accommodate children and they can be disruptive they take their parents mind off their job you cant concentrate on a task with your child there in the background and they distract your colleagues too often its a recipe for complete disaster as in the film mary poppins where the children get taken to the bank for the day it affects productivity all round often people will take their children in because their childcare has fallen through but overall they might be reducing the total output of their office that day if they do go in with children verdict no sharon mears widowed mother with an yearold son im bringing up my son on my own and ive got no family around me if anything goes wrong with my childcare arrangements im caught in a dilemma do i leave the colleagues in the lurch in the magazine office where i work with deadlines to meet or do i go in and take my son with me ive done it when ive had to although of course i dont think an office is the right environment for him and he gets bored its a question of the lesser of two evils the people i work with are brilliant about it but it makes me feel guilty i feel hes distracting other people and that im not working as much as i should be verdict yes in extremis sue nickson head of the employment unit at lawyers hamond suddards unless they have specific provision for it workplaces are no place for a child technically you shouldnt even bring your new baby into the office to show off to your colleagues although of course lots of people do but its a breach of health and safety regulations and thus theres no insurance cover in case anything untoward happens i can see why people are tempted to bring their children into work at half term but it really isnt a good idea employers should talk to their

when it comes to listing key differences between the sexes attitude to debt could probably rank alongside physiognomy and leg waxing as being gender specific debt advice agencies say more women than men use their services and in the case of national debtline per cent of callers are women the consumer credit counselling service reports that per cent of its clients are female but this doesnt mean women are running up more debts than men a woman may be administering a family debt burden as part of her responsibility for household bills men do have their financial strengths however cumulative research shows men more willing to take risks with money as with other things which may lead to greater returns women will avoid risk and thereby returns in return for security research also shows women as more debt intolerant than men so more likely to seek help and seek it sooner i think women are more sensitive to what other people think and debt has a stigma said sophie brookes at national debtline women may also be dealing with an unfortunate sexual birthright if you want to be poor be a woman says economic psychologist professor stephen lea at exeter university women bringing up children alone invariably face financial hardship but poor does not have to mean being a povertystricken single parent lea says it can simply mean being at the bottom of the income group you think you belong to debt accumulated this way may be progressive and a problem only if circumstances change a relationship breaking down say or job loss but if you iron out any sexual weighting women are probably better with money than men weve carried out student debt studies for the best part of years where you can more or less equal out income and essential spending says professor lea in those circumstances women are less likely to be in debt and have lower debts when they are my very strong guess is that where you compare like with like women have the better financial attitude yet the latest british lifestyles survey from mintel reveals that per cent of men regard reducing debt as a priority compared with per cent of women a higher percentage of men than women saw saving as a priority reflecting renewed consumer confidence both sexes were more likely to spend on themselves but women also showed a marked increase in spending on the home per cent against per cent for men the fact that women have this strong bond with their home environment which may be stronger still if they have children may also be part of their debt downfall they may see debt as something difficult to run away from the other key question is whether women in their eagerness to control their home and its budget may also push their partners out of the financial loop claire kelly who now runs the bicester citizens advice bureau has been a money adviser for years she says when you start a relationship it tends to be the woman who deals with money and that role progresses when a financial problem arises the woman continues in her role as money manager but coping with debt often involves reeducation recognising that there is a problem and changing spending patterns if one partner is left out of this process their spending patterns and financial awareness may not change this is perhaps borne out by research into among lowincome families by ruth lister professor of social policy at loughborough university she found that men may actually obstruct womens attempts to keep their families out of debt by quietly running up other debts we certainly found evidence of store cards being used this way to subvert control she says its very important to get advice says kelly but if you are in a relationship it would be better to deal with it as a couple there is potentially a problem if one partner is dealing with the situation while the other partner is still out of control or in denial one solution may be to ensure that finances are talked about openly and regularly such conversations can be painful and potentially fractious but it may be better to tackle them sooner rather than later says lea useful phone numbers national debtline consumer credit counselling service

who holds the key to key to getting the most out of your first or second job its you of course but there is another keyholder your boss and as anyone who has ever worked for a poor manager will testify a boss who lacks the basic set of management skills can soon sap you of all enthusiasm and motivation but what makes a good manager good leadership qualities inspirational creativity a direct line to the boardroom sex yes sex the sex of your boss may be more of a factor than anything else women managers are a small but growing minority in less than of managers in the country were women while today that figure stands at according to figures from analyst remuneration economics women managers also happen to be more efficient and trustworthy have a better understanding of their workforce and are more generous with their praise in short they make the best managers and if male bosses are to keep up they will have to start learning from their female counterparts a dangerous and inflammatory supposition maybe but all the research points towards such a conclusion a survey published at the end of last year by management today magazine serves as an indictment of the ability of male bosses to function as leaders in the modern workplace a majority of those questioned male and female managers across the uk believed women had a more modern outlook on their profession and were more open minded and considerate by way of contrast a similar number believe male managers are egocentric and more likely to steal credit for work done by others more than of those surveyed said men did not make better bosses than women female managers use time more effectively with many of those surveyed commenting that juggling commitments is a familiar practice for women with a home and a family most of us can probably identify at least one woman who attributes her success to an ability to be just like the men after years of having to adopt a masculine identity and hide their emotions and natural behaviour in the workplace it seems female bosses have become more comfortable with using their own style as a way to move forward so much so that women have now become the role models for managers the uk findings tally with a survey of female bosses carried out in the us a fiveyear study of managers from firms found that many male bosses were rated by staff of both sexes to be selfobsessed and autocratic women on the other hand leave men in the starting blocks when it comes to teamwork and communicating with staff still need convincing a team of researchers led by professor nigel piercy and dr nikala lane from cardiff university found that female sales managers are better than men in terms of monitoring directing evaluating and rewarding their sales forces that they build teams with greater commitment than men and that they reduce peoples anxieties about their job by working more closely with them female bosses say the researchers also encourage higher levels of job satisfaction among their teams and manage their teams so that staff turnover is reduced at the coalface there is consensus too mark williams head of recruitment consultant supply chain personnel agees that many women have superior management skills in my experience and from what i have seen in many of the companies i have dealt with and from what i have heard from the candidates i have placed women often make better managers he says women are often considered to be better at the multitasking which management roles call for women managers tend to be more in touch with the feelings of those around them understanding how their own actions and emotions affect the people who work with them they are very capable of juggling numerous work and people issues at the same time taking time to listen and understand every issue and point of view the way men tend to work is very much by focusing on one issue at a time finishing that job and then moving on to the next in management many different areas can explode at once meaning that the manager has to deal with a variety of work at the same time a situation which is often easier for women to handle but lets forget about sex for a

a nationwide army of highly qualified supertemps will be set up to help businesses cover key jobs when staff take maternity and parental leave under plans being considered by the government ministers believe the scheme under which the employment service would act as a giant temping agency would help ease the burden on business of new familyfriendly working regulations by bypassing recruitment costs the plan is also intended to provide flexible work opportunities for skilled professionals particularly mothers who may have dropped out of fulltime employment after having children the trade and industry secretary stephen byers is to examine the plan as part of his consultation on maternity pay and leave announced in last weeks budget and launched with a meeting of whitehall officials yesterday the review is certain to lead to improved rights possibly including longer leave and more time off for fathers potentially putting the government on a collision course with businesses already complaining of overregulation the supertemp scheme would create a pool of skilled temporary workers in specialist fields such as accountancy it or management whose details would be held by local employment service offices workers would be able to state their skills and the times they were able to work perhaps stipulating school terms only small and mediumsized companies needing cover when permanent staff took time off would be able to contact the service to find workers to match their needs saving on the cost of advertising and recruitment businesses complain that finding temporary workers is a key hidden cost of new rights such as parental leave under which parents of children under five can take up to weeks off work unpaid bt estimates its recruitment costs at per worker while the institute of personnel and employment calculates the cost of replacing a junior manager at the minister for women tessa jowell has commissioned the employment service to examine how the scheme will work and is strongly backing the proposal ministers argue that it will kill two birds with one stone by providing practical help for businesses coping with the costs of improved parental rights while offering flexible work options for parents who do not want to work full time other workers expected to be keen to become supertemps are professionals who retire early and find they wish to keep in touch with the workplace and mothers who wish to return to work once their children are older ministers are also considering using the scheme as a gateway to training to help wouldbe temps update skills to match employers needs precisely a government source said one advantage of this is that companies would be more predisposed to any extension of maternity leave if we have shown them beforehand that the government really does want to help them and not simply apply pressure the intention is to make any changes easier for businesses to handle the british chambers of commerce last night welcomed the proposal as a step on the way to easing the potential burden for business of new maternity rights but said more support would be needed to compensate small firms for extra costs spokesman andrew parkinson said its encouraging that the government is now thinking about the answers before proposing the problems in order to sweeten the pill that is something that marks a change in the way government consults on these kind of issues but this would not compensate businesses for the full cost of employing extra staff or finding cover for extended maternity leave sarah jackson cochief executive for the familyfriendly pressure group parents at work said the plan could help the thousands of wellqualified people who are longing to work at a level that suits their skills but just dont want to work full time the pressure professional people find themselves under is tremendous and we know that people are bailing out particularly in their s this would give them a chance to work on their own terms,2000-03,nationwide army highly qualified supertemps set help business cover key job staff take maternity parental leave plan considered government minister believe

working mothers could get the automatic right to return to their jobs parttime after taking maternity leave under plans being considered by the government female ministers are pressing the trade and industry secretary stephen byers to bring in the reform which would delight vocal campaigners for a better balance between work and family life in a move announced in this weeks budget with an eye on winning womens votes mr byers will consult on improving maternity pay and rights there is also strong pressure for a new right to unpaid parental leave for both mothers and fathers to be paid employment minister margaret hodge and womens ministers lady jay and tessa jowell are thought to back the change although mr byers is wary of a negative reaction from employers campaigners say the review marks an opportunity to improve the maternity deal for british mothers who are entitled to the equivalent of weeks off on full pay compared with a european average of weeks lucy anderson a tuc equal rights officer said the most effective way to keep women in touch with the labour market after having children is to increase the coverage of statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance one senior female minister said we are digging in our heels on this and we are being heard clear signals from female ministers particularly in the treasury and department of education and employment that such an entitlement is within reach emerged in the same week that cherie booth called for improved rights for parttime workers and more job sharing as a part of a drive towards more familyfriendly employment however while pressure groups and unions would welcome the reform employers will be concerned about the burden on business government sources say the most resistance is likely to come from mediumsized companies because many larger firms already have the scope to offer parttime deals the smallest organisations are regarded as flexible ministers and sources at the crossdepartmental womens unit believe that change is necessary if the governments commitment to address the worklife balance is to have meaning one source said we know that while the economy is strong it is a sellers market and employers are having to offer flexible working arrangements as part of recruitment packages to recruit the right people but if things get tighter those advantages could be taken away again and women could be left with no negotiating power womens ministers point out that deprived of the chance to return to work parttime many women particularly in low paid jobs opt not to go back to work this adds to the benefits bill and weakens the link between women and the workplace which ministers believe is important in bringing mothers back to work at a level suitable for their skills and experience mr byers is being lobbied on the issue as the regulations for implementing the european directive on parttime work are finalised no timescale has been set for his review of maternity pay and rights female ministers hope that the scope of the consultation will be as wide as possible and treasury sources indicate that payment for parental leave will be included,2000-03,working mother could get

paavo lipponen is a man for our times so says cherie booth applauding the prime minister of finland for handing the top job over to his finance minister and taking a week off last month after the birth of his second daughter lipponen took parental leave for both births booth pointed out i for one am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine example she said it is time that men started to challenge the assumptions in the workplace that the nurturing of children has nothing to do with them our children need their male role models as well as their female ones all eyes are now on tony blair will he let gordon brown take over while he immerses himself in the family after the birth of his fourth child in may what tony blair does when this baby is born will be a very powerful signal to other men about what real men do said mary newburn of the national childbirth trust if he is not seen to take time off that will be quite damaging because it is difficult for men to prioritise their families and it is crucial that they should be able to be involved in sharing responsibility and caring for their children while signals and role models are allimportant to cultural change they do little to help the cashstrapped average working father because the parental leave provisions that the uk has finally brought in now that we are signed up to the social chapter of the eu give men the right to time off but only without pay the new provisions apply equally to men and women who can add the unpaid leave to maternity leave weeks of which is paid there are no retrospective rights parents including adoptive parents are entitled to take a total of weeks off unpaid during the first five years of life of any baby born or adopted after december last year this brings us into line with the rest of the continent but many european countries have already gone further and introduced an element of pay in italy a mother or father gets of earnings for up to six months leave german men can have up to three years off at dm a month on a meantested basis belgium subsidises career breaks at a month for up to five years the nordic countries are already so far ahead that britain is unlikely ever to catch up swedish parents each have a right to a years paid leave and of men take it norwegians get full wages for weeks which can be shared although fathers have a ringfenced four weeks to themselves finland and denmark also have generous arrangements although lipponens gesture was partly intended to boost the male takeup which is only about in the uk there is a further crucial hitch only men and women who have been employed for a year can take parental leave workers on contract have no such entitlement in fact unless the prime ministers contract says so he probably isnt entitled to leave either there has already been a shift in male perceptions of their roles in childcare to judge by attendance levels in the delivery room according to the maternity alliance more than share the experience of childbirth and employers rarely object now however men take the time from holiday entitlement usually spending a few days at home afterwards the government does not expect more than of men to take up paternity leave but of women will the change in the law is not a great advance to make a real difference cherie booth should lean on her husband to take a week off every year until their child is five but tony blair is not the unconventional paavo lipponen the yearold finnish pm courted disapproval in his own country by living with his yearold partner both were divorced and had children already and marrying only when a baby was on the way she is paivi hertzberg a history teacher by taking paternity leave lipponen sent an important message to his fellow countryment no

father im not having any i cant see the point im not the one having the baby if i were then id want maternity leave but im not im freelance anyway but even if i were able to take it i doubt that i would john brown john brown publishing we give parental leave to everybody but in my experience personal and as an employer a lot of people want an excuse to come back to work quickly i think its right to take a few days but especially with the first child you come back to the office for some peace and quiet of course men should have some time off allon reich head of film miramax films uk two children aged two and four i took roughly two weeks when my children were born and there was no sense of it being frowned upon in fact the weinstein brothers his employers sent me a hamper from harrods when my latest was born i had a paternity leave clause written into my contract at miramax john griffiths managing director of the billiondollar intershop three children aged ten eight five i didnt take paternity leave i couldnt afford to we were all on crazy working hours then and taking more than your standard two weeks a year would have been frowned upon if i had a fourth child i would take leave it is more socially acceptable now besides it is my company and i can do what i like rowley leigh chef at kensington place london two children aged fourteen eleven and two most men do try to take a week off but its always at the wrong time the babys always early or late most men take it as holiday we dont give leave and i dont think it should be statutory i took a week for my youngest

cherie booth dropped a broad hint last night that she would like her husband tony blair to take a break from running the country and spend some time with her and their baby after it is born in may she told lawyers and academics at kings college london i am pleased to report that in the prime minister of finland took advantage of his right to parental leave he has done it again recently i for one am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine example delivering a lecture titled the paneuropean vision of labour law in the year she said it is time that men started to challenge the assumptions in the workplace that the nurturing of children has nothing to do with them our children need their male role models as well as their female ones if they are to grow up into wellrounded wellbalanced individuals criticising the long hours workplace culture she called on employers to help their employees particularly women strike a balance between work and family she said the lives of working women were made difficult and sometimes intolerable by the employment environment and its inherent discrimination one form of discrimination she said was the daytoday struggle faced by women as they attempted to balance their paid working lives and their unpaid working lives the second she said was the discrimination which is loudly and clearly spelled out by the pay gap the work environment with rigid working hours inflexible leave patterns long hours and intolerance of career breaks discriminated against women with families but the legal system had not developed quickly enough to deal with this type of discrimination said ms booth a qc specialising in employment law but she believed this would change because employers would need to employ and retain women in the workplace the success of the economy would depend on the skills that women excel at project management knowledge development sharing interpersonal skills and high standards of customer service progress had been helped by legal rights coming mainly from europe but happily grasped with more vigour by the present government these included improved maternity rights parental leave emergency leave for family crises and equal rights for parttime workers but parttime rights could be a doubleedged sword she said the low status and low pay helped perpetuate the pay gap between men and women who made up of parttimers she called for a statutory right for women to return to work part time after having a baby unless the employer could justify requiring her to work full time this would leave employers less vulnerable to claims and large payouts under the sex discrimination act there is no protection from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation under english law but ms booth predicted that the human rights act and powers in the treaty of amsterdam would give gays greater rights by she concluded the partial and if im being incredibly optimistic total closure of the pay gap will be achievable by if we all tackle it with the vigour that this form of outright discrimination against women warrants i hope that we will see in for example john a gay man having protection against discrimination on the grounds of his sexual orientation and mary a yearold working mum earning the same percentage on a parttime basis as john and having the right to request such parttime work from a fulltime position without fear of losing her job,2000-03,cherie booth dropped broad hint last night would like husband tony blair take break running country spend time baby born may told lawyer academic king college london

things are coming together for families at last we are waking up to the facts of social life that we are all connected to each other business depends on people and people depend on business if it takes terms like human capital and family business to persuade the hardheaded that investing in families is the only sensible course to take in social policy thats ok now is the time for the chancellor to reach into his pocket and invest in families in his budget next week he could do much to put substance behind the governments commitment to help families with young children he could increase the flat rate maternity pay from to per week extend the period of entitlement from to weeks and increase the number of weeks paid at of salary from the current six weeks to weeks allowing more mothers to stay at home in the early weeks if they want to he could also raise the child benefit payment in the first year all of these will have a different effect and help different types of family apart from the wealthy all families have a stake in this but there are principles poor families must be helped too this is why we are urging the chancellor to increase the sure start maternity grant to to provide realistic support for mothers and babies in deprived areas there are hard decisions to take about who receives the money since children benefit more from mothers money than from fathers at least we are seriously thinking about worklife balance giving people time to be a family we have the right to parental leave when the need is there though not the means to make it a reality we are finding ways to improve teaching in schools about relationships we even recognise that the same skills are needed in the school home work place and on the streets if we are to be able to lead the good life together all the evidence from research shows that it is the quality of relationships whether in the home or in child care that raises children well its about promoting a culture of decency but caring has always been harder to do on an empty stomach or with worries about how to manage this is especially so now in the presence of conspicuous wealth and fame families need to be supported with money as well as words and the money is there we cannot remind ourselves enough that one in three children in the uk lives in poverty and that it greatly affects life chances we hear that many mothers who want to stay at home longer to care for their babies cant because they fear they will lose their jobs or the mortgage makes it impossible to think of giving up work we know that in the early months of their lives babies are highly sensitive and we have to make it possible for families to provide the best quality of care at that time however they can manage it this is good for baby and good for mother and father shame on you parliament for going wobbly at the sight of mothers breastfeeding is it too much of a reminder that all you big grownup powerful people who make laws were babies once a few measures could transform these early months for families and for children an investment to grow our human capital but the devil is in the detail what kind of investment to whom when for how long and who pays and the detail is certainly devilish as anybody who has tried to explain working families tax credit can confirm we have spent too long putting up with a piecemeal system of family benefits bits tacked on to bits let us get some joined up work to transform the mess into a transparent understandable system where people can work out their likely entitlements without needing armies of benefits advisers to make sense of it given the complexity that is a longerterm goal and it should be in every partys manifesto but what about now much as it is tempting to say go back to the drawing board over the whole system and set up another review of which this government has done so many we need something now parental leave must be paid this would be a direct contribution to poorer families uk research has shown they are least likely to be able to take leave families must get extra resources to make these early vital months easier it is simply crazy to have mothers unwilling and sad at work if they would rather be caring for their babies at home and for the cash conscious it is the cheapest way lots of families just cannot avoid debt with mothers at home and want the parttime solution the government should make it a right,2000-03,thing coming together family last waking fact social life connected business depends people people depend business take term like human capital family business persuade hardheaded investing family sensible course take social policy thats ok time chancellor reach pocket invest family budget next week could much put

vicky diaz is a yearold mother of five a former teacher in the philippines she migrated to the united states to work as a housekeeper and nanny to the twoyearold son of a wealthy family in beverly hills los angeles even now my children are trying to convince me to go home she says they werent angry when i left because they were still very young my husband couldnt get angry either because he knew this was the only way i could help him raise our children i send them money every month the beverly hills family pays vicky a week vicky pays her own familys livein domestic worker back in the philippines a week but living in this global care chain is not easy on vicky and her family im paid well but im sinking in work even while i am ironing the clothes they can still call you to the kitchen to wash the plates it is also very depressing away from my children the only thing i can do is give all my love to tommy the twoyearold american child paradoxically vicky got her job by telling her prospective employer she had experience raising children they asked me if i knew how to take care of a child and i told them i did because i had five of my own global capitalism affects whatever it touches and it touches everything global care chains are usually made up of women most start in a poor country and end in a rich one the chain vicky diaz finds herself in is an increasingly common one an older daughter from a poor family cares for her siblings while her mother works as a nanny caring for the children of a migrating nanny who cares for the child of a family in a rich country however long the care chain is everyone in it tends to focus on the link closest to them from time to time vicky may feel keenly the link between her love for the children she is paid to care for and love of her own children whom she pays another to nurture but her american employers are more likely to see this love as natural individual uncircumscribed by context vicky is a loving person they might say vicky loves tommy but can love be displaced from vicky diazs son alfredo in the philippines on to tommy the son of her employers in los angeles and should we worry that the direction of displacement is upwards in privilege and power are firstworld countries importing maternal love as they have imported copper zinc and gold from thirdworld countries in the past love is not simply a resource that can be taken from one person and given to another but nor is it entirely unlike a resource is time spent with the firstworld child taken from a child further down the care chain is the beverly hills toddler getting surplus love just as the mine owner gets surplus value from the worker digging for gold the idea is unwelcome both to vicky diaz who wants a firstworld job and to her wellmeaning employers who need someone to give loving care to their child each person along the chain feels he or she is doing the right thing for good reasons but transfer of care takes its toll both on the child left behind and on the mother when i saw my children said one filipino nanny weeping i thought oh children do grow up even without their mother i left my youngest when she was only five she was nine when i saw her again but she still wanted me to carry her that hurt me because it showed me that my children missed out a lot sometimes the toll it takes is overwhelming as one filipino nanny said the first two years i felt i was going crazy i would catch myself thinking about my baby every moment every second of the day when i receive a letter from my children i cannot sleep i cry given the depth of this unhappiness one might imagine care chains are a minimal part of the global show but this is not the case since the early s for example of migrants from the philippines have been women and next to electronic manufacturing their remittances make up the countrys major source of foreign currency recent improvements in the economy have not reduced female emigration rather it continues to increase in addition migrants are not drawn from the poorest classes in one study of migrant filipino domestic workers over half the nannies were graduates and most were married mothers in their s money provides a powerful incentive to work and the yawning global wage gap provides a powerful incentive to move migration is simply a ticket to a better life just as global capitalism helps create a thirdworld supply of mothering so it creates a firstworld demand for it at the firstworld end there has been a huge rise in the number of women in paid work from of mothers of children aged six and under in to today indeed american women now make up of the us labour force of mothers of children aged and under now work as do of mothers of children aged six and under in addition working hours have been rising and a lot of american grandmothers who might otherwise have looked after a workers children now do paid work themselves thus at the firstworld end of care chains we find working parents who are grateful to find a good nanny and able to pay more than the nanny could earn in her native country firstworld women who hire nannies are themselves caught in a male career pattern that has proved surprisingly resistant to change women have joined the law academia medicine business professions still organised for men with families who are free of family responsibilities today men take on much more of the childcare and housework but they still base their identity on demanding careers hence the resistance to sharing care at home and the search for care further down the global chain among these firstworld mothers are those who give their emotional labour in turn to companies that hold themselves out as a family researching a leading multinational company i call amerco i discovered a disproportionate number of women employed in the human side public relations marketing human resources it was often the soft touch of women that made amerco seem like a family to other workers among the ultimate beneficiaries of various care chains we thus find multinational companies given the existence of this global care chain and given the chains growing scope it is worth asking how we are to respond i can think of three ways to see care chains through the eyes of the primordialist the sunshine modernist and the critical modernist to the primordialist the right thing would be for each of us to take care of only our own family in our own nation to such a person the existence of care chains seems wrong because such care is usually done by women primordialists often also believe that women should stay at home to provide this care but for the sunshine modernist care chains are an inevitable part of globalisation which is itself uncritically accepted as good if a supply of labour meets demand the sunshine modernist is satisfied the issue of inequality of access to care disappears the critical modernist has a global sense of ethics if she goes out to buy nike shoes she is concerned to learn how low the wage and how long the hours were for the thirdworld factory worker making them she applies the same moral concern to care so she cares about the welfare of the filipino child back home and sees globalisation as a very mixed blessing it brings new opportunities and the nannys access to good wages is one but also new problems including costs we have hardly begun to understand though it is not always the case the poor maids child may be getting less motherly care than the firstworld child we neednt lapse into primordialism to sense that something may be amiss and to search for solutions one approach is to try to reduce incentives to migrate by addressing the causes of the migrants economic desperation another would be to raise the value of caring work such that whoever did it got more credit as well as money for it and care wasnt such a pass on job the value of the labour of raising a child always low relative to the value of other kinds of labour has under the impact of globalisation sunk lower still the declining value of childcare can be compared with the declining value of basic food crops relative to manufactured goods on the international market though clearly more necessary to life crops such as wheat rice or cocoa fetch low and declining prices while those of manufactured goods continue to soar just as the market price of primary produce keeps the third world low in the community of nations so the low market value of care keeps the status of the women who do it and by association all women low a final basic solution would be to involve fathers in caring for their children if fathers shared care it would spread laterally instead of being passed down a social class ladder according to the international labour organisation half of the worlds women between and are in paid work since the rate of increase has skyrocketed in the us and has been high in scandinavia and the uk if we want developed societies with women doctors political leaders teachers and computer programmers we will need qualified people to help care for their children and there is no reason why every society should not enjoy such loving paid childcare it may even be true that vicky diaz is the person to provide it at the same time critical modernists would be wise to extend their concern to the possible hidden losers in the care chain for these days the personal is global this is an extract from an essay which appears in on the edge living with global capitalism edited by will hutton and anthony giddens

the suggestion that feminine qualities are better suited to modern management is well known but last week research from the industrial society appeared to give the idea real substance the results of a survey published by the society showed that the best leadership came from women the under s and those working in the public sector the study the result of three years research asked workers to list the qualities they believed were important in management and rate these against the skills of their current bosses things are not quite that simple of course if women managers seem to have the qualities that workers admire trustworthiness delegation and the ability to set out clear goals it does not necessarily follow that the qualities are intrinsically feminine were not saying men cant do this says debra allcock head of campaigning at the industrial society by the same token the emphasis on youth can appear misleading the fact that best management practice was seen to be concentrated among the under s is probably as significant as the anomaly that the best management practice was found in scotland it is most likely to be related to the fact that more open leadership was generally found lower down the corporate hierarchy among teamleaders and supervisers than among senior management in fact when rated on trust managers under came out with the lowest rating while those over achieved the best it is clearly not a question of age alone but of the qualities themselves tempered by experience the command and control style of management is gradually giving way to a more flexible and collegiate and arguably more feminine approach and managers of all ages must learn to adapt whether they are or they must accept that they have a limited shelflife if they dont says allcock,2000-03,suggestion feminine quality better suited modern management well known last week research industrial society appeared give idea real substance result survey published society showed best leadership came woman working public sector study result three year research asked worker list quality believed important management rate skill current boss thing quite simple course woman manager seem quality worker admire trustworthiness delegation ability set clear goal doe necessarily follow quality intrinsically feminine saying men cant say debra allcock head campaigning industrial society token emphasis youth appear misleading fact best management practice wa seen concentrated among probably significant anomaly best management practice wa found scotland likely related fact open leadership wa generally found lower corporate hierarchy among teamleaders supervisers among senior management fact rated trust manager came lowest rating achieved best clearly question age alone quality tempered experience command control style management gradually giving way flexible collegiate arguably feminine approach manager age must learn adapt whether must accept limited shelflife dont say allcock,"['suggestion', 'feminine', 'quality', 'better', 'suited', 'modern', 'management', 'well', 'known', 'last', 'week', 'research', 'industrial', 'society', 'appeared', 'give', 'idea', 'real', 'substance', 'result', 'survey', 'published', 'society', 'showed', 'best', 'leadership', 'came', 'woman', 'working', 'public', 'sector', 'study', 'result', 'three', 'year', 'research', 'asked', 'worker', 'list', 'quality', 'believed', 'important', 'management', 'rate', 'skill', 'current', 'boss', 'thing', 'quite', 'simple', 'course', 'woman', 'manager', 'seem', 'quality', 'worker', 'admire', 'trustworthiness', 'delegation', 'ability', 'set', 'clear', 'goal', 'doe', 'necessarily', 'follow', 'quality', 'intrinsically', 'feminine', 'saying', 'men', 'cant', 'say', 'debra', 'allcock', 'head', 'campaigning', 'industrial', 'society', 'token', 'emphasis', 'youth', 'appear', 'misleading', 'fact', 'best', 'management', 'practice', 'wa', 'seen', 'concentrated', 'among', 'probably', 'significant', 'anomaly', 'best', 'management', 'practice', 'wa', 'found', 'scotland', 'likely', 'related', 'fact', 'open', 'leadership', 'wa', 'generally', 'found', 'lower', 'corporate', 'hierarchy', 'among', 'teamleaders', 'supervisers', 'among', 'senior', 'management', 'fact', 'rated', 'trust', 'manager', 'came', 'lowest', 'rating', 'achieved', 'best', 'clearly', 'question', 'age', 'alone', 'quality', 'tempered', 'experience', 'command', 'control', 'style', 'management', 'gradually', 'giving', 'way', 'flexible', 'collegiate', 'arguably', 'feminine', 'approach', 'manager', 'age', 'must', 'learn', 'adapt', 'whether', 'must', 'accept', 'limited', 'shelflife', 'dont', 'say', 'allcock']",130

as employee empowerment develops apace it seems beyond belief that anyone would confident enough to blackmail a colleague or client yet that is exactly what carol winstonchurchill who is a barrister attempted with an american investment banker last week at the old bailey winstonchurchill pleaded guilty to threatening to tell david browns manhattan employers bear stern amp company that he was gay after his plans to buy a house in jamaica in fell through brown had already given winstonchurchill for conveyancing fees she refused to return it when the deal was called off when his lawyers began proceedings to recover the money she threatened him the banker who has since died was not in fact homosexual he went straight to the police however winstonchurchill apparently believed that she could exploit the stigma associated with homosexuality at the time but that was nearly years ago could such a thing happen in the modern workplace the last thing yearold david coppola expected when he joined the london office of a multinational bank was a succession of professional snubs and a salary just over half that of younger less qualified colleagues as a senior consultant in commercial banking coppola had been targeted as a fasttrack highflier a successful and wellliked key player in his field his scheduled progression through the initial twoyear tenure was guaranteed or so he thought after five years with the company he has been promoted only once and achieved a salary package far from commensurate with his position the reason he alleges is his sexuality in the first year the fact that im gay came out gradually over postwork drinks i never made a big deal of it and eventually most of my colleagues sussed it anyway he says at this stage coppola reckons he should be at the peak of his career his peers are on around one and half times his present salary and are rising through the ranks his career appears to have reached a standstill glass ceiling is a term usually applied to women who are unable to achieve senior directorial positions as a result of gender prejudice within the workplace until now the gay glass ceiling has not come under close scrutiny by the national lesbian and gay campaigning organisations research and monitoring of individual cases is minimal in part because it is difficult to quantify in part because the position of the individu als affected has not been publicised we do get approached by people who believe their sexuality combined with other peoples prejudice makes promotion problematic says phil greasley who is a campaigner with the lobby group lager lesbian and gay equal rights we try to do as much for them as we can but its difficult to prove an employer is free to choose who to promote and who not to and its easy to assess people so that they dont reach a level for promotion sometimes attitude or approach are mentioned in a negative way its the small details that add up to important evidence though and greasley thinks if it can be shown that a person has been unfairly treated its not always necessary to prove that sexuality is the reason coppola has a briefcase full of details he believes he has been regularly excluded from significant meetings business trips and conferences and kept isolated and uninformed coppola is not alone in his complaint in other instances too a gay glass ceiling appears to be firmly if unofficially lodged in company structure paul mcbride is a human resources manager working for a city council around the predominant male managers mcbrides honesty about his sexuality makes people twitchy he came out to his colleagues six months after joining the council eight years later he has reservations about having done it because of the still largely blokish office culture im not the kind of person who talks about their sex life a lot but i have found it in my interest to play it down the further up the organisation i go the more i find myself spending time with women at the same level because we have quite a lot of common experiences we dont get invited to the pub or to play golf for some the absence of a family causes problems the corporate publication management today cites sir bob reid deputy governor of the bank of scotland who believes that anyone gay or straight who lacks a solid family backdrop is suspicious the whole thing about life is that you get into trouble because you dont have a wide breadth of experience you have to be suspicious of people who dont have children jumping on their sofas at home they dont know about real life mcbride is not surprised by reids remarks there are still very strong male networks and although on the surface it doesnt look like thats whats going on the higher up you get most business goes on outside the office and you dont get invited you just dont find out in dr nicholas priestley a clinical neuropsychologist was made clinical director of a private clinic in bury as one of the countrys leading expert witnesses in headinjury litigation and one of the most senior doctors in his field priestley was regarded as the only suitable candidate thrilled to be appointed he had no idea that three years later he would be embroiled in an industrial tribunal with his employers westminster healthcare over sex discrimination and constructive dismissal priestley alleges that management and colleagues taunted him relentlessly about his sex uality and the integrity of his character in the corridor colleagues would call me sick and perverted priestley claims they simply could not treat a gay man as an equal

verbal complaints to his employers about his treatment in june priestley felt he had no option but to hand in his resignation priestleys claims are denied by his employers who say that there was no discrimination and that priestley resigned for his own reasons priestley hoped to win a moral victory at industrial tribunal but claims the day hearing was unfair he claims that at one point he was asked when taking the oath how he could swear on the bible given that he was gay priestley felt forced to abandon his case and a complaint has been made to the lord chancellors department about the conduct of the tribunal priestley is now a national health service consultant neuropsychologist at a hospital in widnes since his story has become public with the backing of stonewall the gay rights group the trades union congress and now liberty priestley has received overwhelming support from a number of labour mps who are keen to see his case used to bring about a change in the law on employment rights for lesbians and gay men speaking in the house of commons on december priestleys mp david chaytorm said if dr priestley had been a woman had had a disability of some kind or had been a member of an ethnic minority he would have had recourse to the law earlier there is clearly a case for building discrimination on the grounds of sexuality into antidiscrimination legislation priestley says that his case has acted as a catalyst for the introduction of a voluntary code of practice in the public sector in the near future which although not directly effective in the private sphere would make it more difficult for employers to discriminate in the workplace campaigners believe its a start though not much to shout about and nicholas priestley concludes a statutory code of conduct must be implemented good employers are already implementing such policy its the bad ones who must be forced to change such a move would finally change a culture which can sustain blackmail and

do children suffer when their mothers work or do they thrive hardly a month goes by without a study establishing beyond doubt that children who are put into nurseries by their working mothers a grow up to be emotional and educational cripples or b are the luckiest most talented and resilient creatures who ever lived its an eitheror debate that has had a pernicious effect whatever parents decide to stay at home fulltime to work parttime fulltime or overtime to put their children into nurseries occasionally or all day long or use no childcare at all one group of experts will say it is the wrong choice but maybe both sides of the debate have got it wrong according to ellen galinsky of the new yorkbased families and work institute maternal employment is not the alldetermining factor we thought it was what counts is not if a mother works but how she works and how a father works counts as much if mothers and fathers are stressed at work they will bring their work home with them but as common sense suggests and research can now confirm if they are in happier jobs in which they enjoy a degree of autonomy they have more energy for their children when they get home and their children are the better for it the evidence from a large study by the us national institute of child health and human development is that children do best when their mothers can choose whether to work or stay at home having been able to make a positive choice about the arrangements that best suit them and their families they are miraculously more effective as parents the study has also found that while good childcare can have a small positive effect on childrens cognitive development the quality of family life continues to be the most important influence on a childs development family life does not just depend on love but also on money the biggest single risk factor when assessing a childs chances in life turns out to be poverty common sense suggests all this but why has it taken so long to find its way into serious research tony munton of the institute of education says john bowlby is to blame dr bowlby is the originator of attachment theory which grew out of work he did after world war ii with children in institutional care having found their emotional and intellectual development was impaired he concluded that a childs development is contingent on exclusive maternal care that maternal separation from the child disrupts the attachment process and that therefore mothers with young children should not work policymakers trying to find jobs for men returning from the war took to the theory with enthusiasm women had taken over many jobs and if they did not now step out of them the country would have a problem according to dr munton attachment theory gave a theoretical justification to the argument that mothers should not work it influenced policy makers the world over in the world health organistion went so far as to say that the use of day nurseries would cause permanent damage to the emotional health of a future generation attachment theory has continued to influence policy on mothers working though it has had a shakier career in the academic world bowlbys research was about children in residential care studies of children in daycare have not uncovered the same problems munton notes that bowlbys ideas on the need for the mother to be exclusive carer were not confirmed by a review of nonindustrial societies where only five had mothers as exclusive carers according to michael rutter of the institute of psychiatry in london children can cope well with several adults caring for them provided it is the same adults over time and provided that the individuals with whom they have secure relationships are available at times when they are tired distressed or facing challenging circumstances these secure relationships do not need to take place inside a home there is no reason why a child could not also enjoy the same benefits when in the care of trained professionals even so it would be silly even dangerous to deduce from this that children of working mothers thrive or that childcare is good for children its only good if it is well good but knowing that does not answer the important question what sort of life do we want for our children at home and outside during their early years how much time do we want them to spend outside the home how much time do we want to spend with them when should they start formal education now that research has shown how important informal play is should we put kids into school at four these are the sorts of practical forwardlooking questions that we need to be asking if we are going to get childcare right they are urgent questions says anne longfield of the kids clubs network more than half of mothers whose youngest child is under five are now economically active and per cent of mothers whose youngest child is between five and now work most have no choice it is that or poverty quality is important to all working parents when making childcare arrangements but in practice they are seldom in a position to insist on it demand far exceeds supply only per cent of undereights have access to a registered childcare place fewer than per cent of year olds have access to outofschool childcare or holiday playschemes and yet per cent of working families use childcare twothirds of children under five spend time in the care of adults who are not their parents most of these adults are not trained professionals but relatives neighbours and unregistered untrained childminders most families have no choice but to resort to informal care arrangements with private nurseries charging roughly the same as private schools most families would not be able to afford formal childcare even if it were available so they make do with the resources they have to hand while informal care can be a good thing as in the case of a doting grandmother it can also mean leaving children with people who have little understanding of children and may even be a danger to them but much of the registered care on offer is also poor no working parent can breathe easily until all childcare workers are held to consistent and enforceable standards the clunkily named national childcare strategy is a vast initiative that aims to create childcare places for up to a million children new outofschool clubs and new playworker and childcare jobs it hopes to offer one million children safe and enjoying learning opportunities support one million parents to work or train and help a quarter of a million parents move off benefits its mantra is quality quality quality get childcare right and well see less delinquency in adolescence and happier higher achieving adults and all of society will benefit the key concept is continuity at present says dr munton a child will have been through as many as seven or eight different child care arrangements by the age of five and thats not good childcare services should be designed so that children dont lose touch with the carers they love and trust on a routine basis this is one of the reasons why in the centres of excellence that the government has set up to date the aim is to provide childcare from birth to age but even the highest quality childcare services are worthless unless they fit in with the way we work they have to suit shift workers and shortterm contract workers and parents who work long or antisocial hours not just the lucky few who are still in stable to jobs so to get childcare right you have to push for serious changes in the work world too according to munton the national childcare strategy is the most radical piece of legislation weve seen in this country since the formation of the welfare state but the majority of people dont know about it what we need according to munton and galinsky and their fellow campaigners is to throw out the old debate and begin a new one the first challenge is to make sure children get the best possible environments wherever they are the second challenge is to make sure that working parents have access to high quality services they can afford the third is to make sure that childcare is not compulsory it is important says lucy daniels associate director of the worklife research centre that parents do not allow themselves to be turned into wage slaves there is always the danger that a vast supply of high quality childcare might give parents less leverage when arguing for flexible familyfriendly work patterns but parents and children of all ages need family time and parents with very young children should be able to stay at home with their children for extended periods without having to suffer the severe economic setbacks they do today the national childcare strategy needs to go hand in hand with some sort of national workplace strategy the idea that childcare is not just a private responsibility but also a social one has become a minority view the majority think mothers who involve others in the care of their children are mothers who are not doing their job and that government should not spend money to let them off the hook according to daniels the main challenge is to make the case that good childcare like good health and education is good for society this sounds like yet another piece of common sense caring for children means caring for the next generation it is in everyones interest we do the job well,2000-04,child suffer mother work thrive hardly month go without study establishing beyond doubt child put nursery working mother grow emotional educational

mothers and fathers of children under five will be offered state payments of up to a week to take parental leave under government proposals designed to make britains workplaces more familyfriendly every parent will be offered up to paid weeks off work at an estimated cost of m a year in a move designed to be a centrepiece of labours policy on the family in the manifesto for the next general election the trade and industry secretary stephen byers is backing proposals drawn up by the labour mp ruth kelly on behalf of the strong labour parliamentary womens group mr byers who is in charge of government policy on maternity pay and parental leave said this is a significant piece of work which will inform our consideration of this important area government ministers are to start lobbying business to persuade them that paid parental leave will be good for firms leading to a more contented workforce and helping them attract and keep key staff while ministers are keen to maintain business support for the government they believe the scheme would help the government appeal to women voters who backed tony blair in the election but have since started to have second thoughts at a downing street seminar last month labour party strategists argued that labour needs to trump william hagues appeal to socalled florida woman ms kellys blueprint costed by the accountants kpmg and due to be published in a fabian pamphlet next month has found favour with downing street where the expected arrival of cherie blairs fourth child next month has sharpened the debate about parental leave and is being strongly pressed by labours women ministers the government introduced an unpaid scheme for parental leave last december but projections indicate that without payment only of men and of women would take advantage of the offer of time off however a poll conducted by icm and sponsored by the joseph rowntree reform trust found that of the parents questioned would be very interested or interested in a paid scheme and that the amount of time taken off work would increase with the generosity of the scheme parents would take weeks leave on average at a week but this would rise to weeks at a week mothers said they would take more time off than fathers but among men the scheme appealed most to those on the lowest incomes ms kelly said i would argue for the full per week for weeks it would be affordable and have a huge impact on takeup particularly among fathers its a very simple scheme and could create a climate which changes the culture it would allow parents to spend more time with children and juggle the responsibilities of an increasingly complex working life the two ministers for women lady jay and tessa jowell and equal opportunities minister margaret hodge are in favour of the proposal ms jowell said yesterday parental leave is one of the most important issues both for labour market policy and family policy for people in britain today pressure groups last night urged mr byers to take the rowntree findings seriously sarah jackson cochief executive of parents at work said we know from parents who call our helpline that they cannot afford to take this leave unless it is paid we talk to a lot of low income families who are desperate to take time off to spend with their children but cannot do so christine gowdridge director of the maternity alliance which coordinates a national coalition of campaigners under the parental leave campaign said the rowntree research was one more brick in the wall of ammunition in favour of paid leave however the cbi gave the proposals a cool reception it said that a survey of its members found of businesses very worried about parental leave ranking it as one of their leading concerns john cridland the cbi director of human resources policy said businesses have had enough of new regulations we cannot cope with more and the more we are pressed the more negative we will get the icm survey found that of voters and of women questioned would be more likely to vote for a party that promoted paid parental leave while only said they would be less likely to do so,2000-04,mother father child five offered

a raft of familyfriendly measures is planned by the government to meet increasing dissatisfaction among women voters among the ideas being considered are higher maternity pay an increase in financial support for poorer families for the first year of a childs life and a baby bounty for employers who take back new mothers to work on a parttime basis the measures are from a policy blueprint drawn up by harriet harman the former social services secretary to tackle the growing perception that the government is not doing enough to help women balance work and home commitments the point plan urges the government to lead by example and show a new modern face civil servants should be allowed to work parttime if they have family commitments this right could be extended to ministers who might be allowed to share jobs the plans will be considered by the treasury and action is expected in the autumn the moves come after new evidence of dissatisfaction with the governments performance among women vot ers who switched to labour in the general election a report by the respected pollster deborah mattinson of opinion leader research said that although the government still held the support of women they were becoming disillusioned with labours performance women are per cent less likely than men to say they are satisfied with the government among the key age group to yearolds the fabled

cherie booth and madonna two women who were by no means universally popular a few months ago have succeeded in turning themselves into national heroines by becoming pregnant in their forties while it is generally frowned upon to reproduce in your teens and considered sensible to get on with it in your twenties and thirties there seems to be something reckless but charming about a woman in her forties making the sacrifices necessary for parenthood but longed for or unexpected the reality of having children in ones forties can be tough apart from the health risks to mother and child it can play havoc with carefully laid plans career women such as cherie booth are probably getting to the peak of their earning power and may be unwilling to take a career break or to cut back on working days moreover when booths youngest child reaches the age when he or she may want to go on to university its mother will be an age by which many people hope to have retired setting these two expectant mothers aside as their wealth makes them untypical anyone contemplating parenthood perhaps for the first time in her forties will face complicated financial choices it may seem a prosaic consideration but it is worth bearing in mind that a career break can wreck your pension planning someone who takes off the average of six and a half years to raise a child can retire on a third less than colleagues who do not if you do take a break you should restart and increase your contributions as soon as you can the alternative is bleak a recent survey by lloyds bank showed that more than half british women and most of those who take career breaks are women due to retire in will receive pensions below the poverty line currently you are not allowed to contribute to a pension either a company or personal one unless you are in paid employment company pension schemes usually treat statutory maternity leave as pensionable service and expect you to continue your contributions you can either save a percentage of your statutory maternity pay and pay less into your pension or you can carry on with the normal contributions if you can afford it if you take longer leave than the statutory minimum you are not allowed to continue your contributions the introduction of the stakeholder pension in april next year offers hope to thousands of people who are taking a career break not only will the scheme be cheap the maximum charge is capped at per cent per year but you will be able to put money aside for your retirement regardless of whether you are in paid employment and you will still qualify for tax contributions on your highest rate state support for women who stop work to have a baby is not generous statutory maternity pay is only a week oneoff sure start grants are available for less welloff families which with a household income of up to may be eligible for the working families tax credit but the qualifying rules are complicated british parents are also lumbered with some of the highest childcare bills in europe a late addition to the family of a working woman may mean a return to paying a nannys salary or nursery or childminders fees just as older children have begun to fend for themselves parents who have spare cash are often keen to save for their childrens future this may be especially true if they are concerned that they will no longer be earning as the child enters adulthood banks and building societies offer competitive savings accounts for children rates can be more than per cent and your children can usually register to have the interest paid before tax you can also invest in the stock market on behalf of your children but beware the inland revenue rules governing the amount that parents can give to their children friends and other relatives are not similarly hampered you may even wish to consider buying a stakeholder pension for your child as surprisingly there is no age limit on who can take one out donna bradshaw of fiona

sue douse who turns in june had planned to have more children since the birth of her son christopher nine years ago unfortunately she had difficulty conceiving and turned to fertility treatment the happy result of this was the birth four and a half months ago of twin daughters annabelle and samantha but however thoroughly thought through the arrival of children has had a major impact on her finances sue from surrey needs to travel a lot in her work as a senior investment consultant she has recently returned to her job fulltime and realised that she needed a topclass nanny to take care of her three children while she worked to do this the nanny has to be really wonderful she says such nannies do not come cheap also her new nanny has her hands full with the children meaning that sue has had to take on a cleaner on the plus side having more children has made her give a bit more time to focusing on her familys finances rather than just other peoples i never seemed to have time to sit down and think about it before she says some of her precious maternity leave was taken up with her financial reorganisation including remortgaging the family home so that we have a comfortable

harassed working parents know all about the worklife balance trying to meet deadlines in the office and still get home in time to bath the children and read them a bedtime story is a constant struggle so there is little surprise that working parents have been among the first to applaud the governments promise to consider introducing paid parental leave for mothers and fathers taking time out to bring up children the logic in favour of reform is clear as it stands the european union directive introduced last december means that all parents now have the right to a minimum of weeks leave without pay which may be taken at any time until each child is five years old but lets face it its an expensive option one that many mums and dads can only dream of says dianah worman adviser to the institute of personnel and development consequently lowpaid parents have to sit in envy watching their wealthier colleagues take advantage of a law that they cannot she points to a law passed by the clinton administration in giving parents in the us similar rights the law was certainly popular but takeup among families on low incomes was vastly reduced paid parental leave must be the answer right wrong argues ruth lea head of policy at the institute of directors iod current maternity rights already make of iod members think twice about hiring young women and the introduction of paid parental leave would compound this she says its not a matter of breaking the sex discrimination act its simply a matter of running your firm to survive our members have to run businesses in a tough competitive environment even our female members take the same attitude to hiring women as opposed to men andrew parkinson from the british chambers of commerce agrees the parent of three preschoolers he argues might be looking at an entitlement of well over six months in a single year employers understandably arent going to see you as the pick of the crop in the interview session although parental leave is open to both men and women it is undoubtedly women who are most likely to take it consider tony blairs decision last week not to take paternity leave when his baby is born in may and consider the current situation with career breaks says a spokesperson from the industrial society reports show that very few male employees take up the option in comparison to women and that when women take it its usually for family commitments in fact last week many small businesses opposed the governments announcement claiming they would rather choose to develop their own policies on parental leave nearly half of the firms responding to a survey by the bcc already offer paternity leave and allow time for family emergencies there is a perception that firms particularly smaller ones would be dickensian if they had the chance but the reality is that the vast majority now recognise the benefits of familyfriendly policies notably productivity and staff retention says parkinson smaller companies are often the most family friendly because the relationships between employer and employee are so much tighter worman adds that staff in large companies may also suffer as a result of paid parental leave after five years service at apple computer for instance staff are expected to take a onemonth paid break on to which they can add some annual leave likewise mcdonalds offers paid leave of eight weeks to employees with ten years service and at tesco staff can take as many as five years on an unpaid career break even if they have only worked there a short time by bringing in setinstone regulations about parental leave into such companies she argues these kinds of schemes which are more generous than the governments may have to be thrown out altogether to make room for the new law nobody is saying that parents shouldnt get free child care just that any arrangements should be developed to meet the needs of both the individual employer and employee says worman the same goes for employees requiring time off to care for elderly or disabled relatives who after all should not be forgotten in this debate parental leave of any kind needs to be flexible even tailormade what employers and government must realise she argues is that one size does not fit all,2000-04,harassed working parent know worklife balance trying meet deadline office still get home time bath child read bedtime story

the world welcomed baby leo but few as warmly as those pressing the government to revise its dickensian policies on worklife balance by chance the blair baby has arrived right into the middle of national childcare week and its organisers could hardly contain their grins in westminster junior ministers and mps all of them women were nudging one another gloating and beaming hello leo in this tiny personage is now vested high hopes of radical change there is a groundswell of anger about our overworking brutalising long hours culture and labours deliberate weakening of every eu directive aimed at making life bearable for working families not so much new labour as hard labour now in the air there hovers the inescapable image of the infant leo its not that anyone thinks the prime minister has gone soft perish the thought only last week he went out of his way to promise the cbi that there would be ever less regulation on employers boasting that britains employers are even more lightly regulated than in the united states his government is still trying to deny parental leave to the great majority of parents even as his wife acted in court for the tuc yesterday disgracefully the government effectively got its way although the judges said the tuc case was likely to prevail they still sent the case off to brussels where it may take two years by which time many of the disputed parents will have lost their rights as their children will be over five years old a good example of justice delayed being justice denied but whatever his father thinks leos presence will not let the issue to go away look at that charming picture of the prime minister taking his parental leave lolling on a sofa in his casual clothes cooing happily to his baby while his government prevents most other parents doing likewise it just doesnt look good its another worrying example of how downing street is losing its political touch obstinacy on parental leave is needless folly when the case could have been gracefully withdrawn with a sincere promise to think again why do they bother fighting it so hard when this unpaid parental leave will be taken by very few only parents in countries where the leave is paid can afford to take it little leo will raise other questions for example when will his mother go back to work will it be as soon as paid maternity is over at weeks like most women have to far too soon or will it be after the other weeks unpaid which only a few welloff women can afford to take also too soon then comes childcare most families dont and cant afford to pay for childcare if leo was lucky enough to get into one of the very few westminster council nurseries there are only places in the whole borough for nonspecial needs children it would cost a week the maximum poor families can claim in childcare tax credits is a week although that seemed a huge and generous sum when gordon brown gave this first ever significant state help with childcare alas it turns out that most childcare now costs between a week in london it is even more it may be unfair but there will be no avoiding these comparisons between leo and other babies perhaps it was partly invited in that moving part of last years prime ministerial party conference speech there is no more powerful symbol of our politics than the experience of being on a maternity ward seeing two babies side by side delivered by the same doctors and midwives yet with two totally different lives ahead of them one returns with his mother to a bed and breakfast that is cold damp cramped a mother who has no job no family to support her sadder still no one to share the joy and triumph of the new baby a father nowhere to be seen the second child returns to a prosperous home grandparents desperate to share the caring and a father with a decent income and an even larger sense of pride he called for strong families cherished by strong communities and although he was talking mainly about this fine promise to abolish child poverty in years it takes good familyfriendly policies to support strong families today a mori poll for national childcare week asks mothers what hinders them returning to work three quarters of parents polled said it as lack of affordable childcare employers have done virtually nothing to help only have workplace nurseries only offer help with costs it helps explain why not nearly enough mothers invited to join the new deal for lone parents have taken up the offer the main point of childcare tax credits was to try to entice the single mothers living on benefits into work so far few have even in this booming employment market although families have taken up the credits they only get an average a week low because they are higher earners so they qualify for less or because they are only claiming for parttime work it was hoped childcare credits would stimulate a whole new market in nurseries and childminders but in the poorest areas there are virtually none with no capital to build nurseries and no community organisations to seize the opportunity collette kelleher director of the day care trust says many mothers in deprived areas wont work until they have bright lively local nurseries staffed with welltrained people many say they dont trust childminders or see no reason to hand their child over to a less good mother the lotterys new opportunities fund has done well in spreading afterschool and holiday clubs around the country but for the under threes there is very little a network of stateoftheart young childrens centres as found in much of europe is still an age away we await julys spending review margaret jay margaret hodge yvette cooper tessa jowell and many women backbenchers led by harriet harman are now arguing fiercely for more childcare and for a radical new focus on the whole worklife agenda stephen byers is one of those responsible for the serious error this government made in siding with whingeing small employers against the clear distress of an overworked nation it was he who tried to whittle parttime workers rights down to almost nothing but now even he has seen the light and is bidding strongly with the treasury for paid parental leave to be promised in the next manifesto it must be the leo effect but byers the late convert could help turn labour into the real party of the family with the universal right to work part time to work a fourday week to get home before children are in bed to go to school plays open days and birthday parties or just to see the light of day in winter why do

more than million working parents excluded from the governments new parental leave scheme face a long wait to learn the outcome of a legal challenge launched on their behalf by the tuc the high court today referred the case to the european court of justice for a ruling on the meaning of part of the european parental leave directive and agreement on which the scheme is based which could take up to two years the high court refused the tucs plea for an order that in the meantime the excluded parents could take leave even though they might eventually lose the case but lord bingham the lord chief justice and mr justice morison urged the european court to deal with the case as a matter of urgency they said that if as we think trade and industry secretary stephen byers may have acted unlawfully in the way he introduced the scheme the sooner this is made clear the better the tucs argument that the government broke european law by excluding million employees from the right to take unpaid parental leave was presented last week by cherie booth qc in her last court appearance before the birth of her son leo under the parental leave regulations introduced on december last year parents of children born or adopted on or after that date are entitled to weeks leave spread over the years up to a childs fifth birthday the prime ministers wife seeking judicial review in a case against mr byers contended that the cutoff date wrongly shut out parents of children under five born before december today the tuc was given leave to appeal against the judges refusal to grant an interim order allowing the parents to take leave while europe decides the court heard that if the european court took two years to make a ruling around one million of the parents would have lost their leave entitlement forever because their children would by then be more than five tuc general secretary john monks claimed a clear moral victory after todays judgement ministers should now extend parental leave to the nearly million working parents who have missed out without the need for a lengthy european court case he said fighting what looks like a doomed case in the european court simply to delay parental leave for those parents with children born before the december deadline sends all the wrong signals from a government that says it wants a better worklife balance he said it is sad to see the

the blairs cant say they werent warned the nappy debate gave the game away even before baby leo arrived every decision they make over their fourth childs first year will have instant political significance from choice of nappy we already know their preference is for terry towelling rather than easy but landfillclogging disposables to childcare in a spindoctored world where the personal is political and vice versa such details will be headline news reported and chewed over by a string of columnists in more depth than britains dilemmas over euro entry below we detail some of the critical decisions facing the blairs like any parents over the first months and gauge the significance of their preferences in buggies and babyfood for a fickle electorate breastfeeding always a hot topic and now more political than ever due to the row over breastfeeding in the house of commons despite requests from mps nursing newborns the speakers office has banned the taking of refreshment in committee rooms a new government breast is best campaign launched only days before mrs blair entered the labour ward is intended to boost uk breastfeeding rates from among the lowest in europe and the department of health would doubtless welcome such a highprofile example on the basis of current statistics she is almost certain to nurse assuming all goes smoothly figures show that middleclass educated older mothers are far more likely than their less welloff counterparts to prefer breast to bottle however if the lure of a return to the courtroom proves irresistible within weeks she may choose to switch wholly or partly to formula potentially incurring the wrath of the breastisbest lobby the choice of brand is a minefield an ethical foreign policy would not approve of manufacturers who foist formula on poor women in developing countries fathers role tony blair has already encountered the politics of paternity leave a right which does not exist in the uk though a new entitlement to unpaid parental leave has just been introduced and has opted for a typically new labour third way to the disappointment of campaigners for better balance between home and work he will not take time off but hop up and down the downing street staircase between his no office and the first familys appartment above no but while the prime minister clearly did not feel he could be as radical as finnish prime minister paavo lipponen who took a weeks leave on the birth of his baby last february he is known to value greatly the time spent with his older children and is certain to be an involved father visitors to chequers report that the blair children and their father can often be found playing football in the gardens and mr blair frequently refers in interviews to cherie and the kids a key influence on the prime minister is likely to be the memory of the severe stroke which hit his own father leo at just the illness though devastating meant he benefited by seeing much more of the once workaholic barrister mr blair has said however as prime minister the battle for worklife balance is one he is unlikely to win if the polls dip for labour critics will accuse him of devoting too much time to fatherhood while leaving childcare duties to mrs blair and the nanny will mean bowing to the forces of conservatism he claims to despise childcare another contentious issue mrs blair has already disclosed that initially at least she will spurn paid help in favour of her mother gale booth who will move into the downing street flat in doing so she will buck the trend among professional parents only of whom rely on relatives to look after their children compared with of lowerincome groups later on the blairs may well turn to a livein nanny which would highlight the fact that for the vast majority of parents finding good childcare is costly with neither tax relief nor employer incentives the blairs will also have to address the problem of isolation for the downing street baby particularly since friends their own age are likely to have children much older than the new arrival if they choose a toddler group nursery or playgroup it will have to be a public or voluntarysector facility to avoid tory jibes over going private clothing a tough dilemma now that political style so often triumphs over substance despite new labours professed passion for football the blairs are unlikely to opt for the miniature football boots la anas daughter of oasiss noel gallagher nor the brooklyn beckhamstyle football shirt perhaps ronit zilkha mrs blairs favourite designer could be persuaded to knock up a few outfits for special occasions though that could leave worcester woman feeling outclassed buying british would mean sturdy but dull mamps or mothercare standbys whereas baby gap middle englands favourite yet sadly american could provide stylish mini combat trousers for that islington look toys how much to spend and what to buy now that manufacturers so effectively persuade small consumers to fleece their parents leo should at least be too young for pokmon cards but will the blairs succumb to garish plastic teethers that play old macdonald hardly in keeping with georgian downing street or go for stylish wooden alternatives favoured by parents but ignored by their offspring either way the child is certain to be given footballs galore with the soccer vote in mind transport the blairs famously pile their brood into a peoplecarrier but leos personal transport will require some tough decisions the options have multiplied since the births of euan nicky and kathryn as has the style subtext lurking behind the most innocent buggy the oldfashioned carriage pram would hark back to the mary poppins era but the trendy allterrain threewheeler could come in handy for the downing street roadhumps the practical blairs whose hall was reported by their former nanny to be jammed with pushchairs and toys will probably go for a prudent but purposeful travel system combining car seat buggy and carrycot maybe uncle gordon who lives next door will even be allowed to push the buggy occasionally vaccinations every parent faces a dilemma over immunisation but the vast majority weigh up the relative risks and opt to have it done babies are vaccinated against polio diphtheria tetanus whooping cough and the hib form of meningitis at two months three months and four months at a year or a little more they have the mmr measles mumps and rubella vaccine claimed to be linked controversially with autism since immunisation is part of a government programme the blairs are almost certain to have leo vaccinated there may be criticism from campaigners who argue that doctors put too much pressure on parents to agree to immunisation food mrs blair is opting for recycled nappies will she buy organic baby food or will she set the best example and make her own the trendiest babies are green ones and the blairs may choose to raise leo on costly but pesticidefree organic meals now taking of the british market after a recent dramatic boom critics would make snide references to pured polenta and grumble that only highflying lawyers can afford such things more risky for tony blair is the question of gm food the pm has indicated that he is happy to eat gm himself but the spectacle of former tory minister john gummer stuffing a burger down his daughters throat to prove the safety of british beef should warn him off using his children as guineapigs back to work as a hotshot employment lawyer mrs blair has already attracted criticism from some quarters by working so close to the birth setting an example beyond the energy or will of most expectant mothers although she is widely expected to follow the pattern she set with her older children and return to work relatively quickly worklife balance campaigners however will be watching to see whether the prime ministers wife who recently moved to new legal chambers cuts down her office hours and works at home in line with the governments promotion of familyfriendly working publicity the blairs have always made much of shielding their children and family life from the public eye and insist they want to continue that policy with leo downing street has promised one photo session after which he will disappear behind the security gates of downing street emerging for the cameras only for the familys traditional tuscan summer holiday snap with a general election possibly under a year away however the temptation to wheel out the new arrival from time to time could prove too great leading to a

leading businesswomen launched a scathing attack on the governments record on maternity rights last night claiming that britain is the worst place in europe to be a working mother the condemnation came as female executives from overseas on an advanced management course at the london business school this month heard with astonishment of the poor leave arrangements and employer attitudes that highflying british women face julia martin a fund manager drew gasps from her foreign counterparts when she said she could take just weeks maternity leave after the birth of her second baby it took me three months just to get used to being a mum said randi birkeland mother to four children and a vice president of norways hydro supply network in norway as in denmark and sweden women are entitled to a years paid leave and for a year after they return to work they are entitled to work shorter hours while they continue breastfeeding margareta le calv general manager of swedish communications giant telenordia has recently been promoted she is six months pregnant and expects to make the most of her countrys generous parental rights these include an incentive to fathers to take days paid leave after the birth and then a further four weeks during the childs first year men are also entitled to take some of their partners entitlement meaning the total leave can be shared martin said some of the blokes say dont you have to rush home for the children they assume its the woman who will rush home they think women wont want to travel away from home maryann stephenson director of the fawcett society which campaigns for equality between women and men said this is not limited to small companies the majority of male directors of ftse companies are married with children the majority of the few women directors are single without children yet when we look abroad it is obvious that a company can still be efficient and make lots of money if it looks after its female employees the average woman in britain has just eight weeks maternity leave on full pay compared to the european average of weeks stephenson said women in this country have come to accept a poor deal as normal they were allowed into the workplace so long as they worked like men but the normal working model here is based on just half the population the whole issue of long hours the attitude to jobsharing and parttime working for men and women needs to be addressed julia mellor head of the equal opportunities commission said employers as well as employees have much to gain from better parental leave and maternity arrangements many are concerned about the number of people leaving good jobs because they are not prepared to sacrifice family life for their career firms in scandinavia try harder to attract mothers and then keep them le calv said women are now asking for some help or other benefits than salaries so instead of getting a company car or a raise in salary they say i want hours a week cleaning paid for by the company labour mp ruth kelly a member of the strong labour parliamentary womens group who wants parents to be paid a week to take three months leave said we need a complete rethink of our maternity and parental leave and this is what is going on at the moment at the dti we have the department of health saying on the one hand that it is wise to breastfeed your baby for the first six months and on the other hand we have maternity leave which means that after the first six weeks the statutory pay is only per week roger lyons general secretary of the manufacturing science and

a heavilypregnant cherie booth yesterday proved herself a thorn in the governments side as she led an impassioned legal defence of the need to balance parenthood with working life in her last high court appearance before the birth of her fourth child due next week the prime ministers barrister wife declared on behalf of the tuc that government policy on parental leave was unlawful ms booth who recently hinted strongly that she wanted her husband to take paternity leave when their baby arrived spoke forcefully of allowing parents to strike a balance between work and family rights in a row over a new entitlement to parental leave the regulations which last year brought an eu directive into british law allow up to weeks unpaid leave to mothers and fathers of children under five but under pressure from employers organisations the government restricted this right to parents of children born after december last year the tuc bringing its case against the trade and industry secretary stephen byers claimed the privilege should also have been made available to all existing parents who had children under five on that date the legal battle highlights continuing tensions within mr blairs administration between the urge to keep business sweet and promoting familyfriendly working the government has also come under strong pressure not least from its own female backbenchers to provide some form of payment for parental leave amid warnings that few parents particularly fathers will otherwise take up the new right ms booth appearing with a team of three women barristers catering for any eventuality said the governments restriction had the effect of cutting off m parents from claiming the extra time with their children that was theirs by right she said it created a twotier system of parental leave those parents fortunate in having children born after december and other parents with similar age children born before that tony blair chose this week to reveal that while he would scale back his official workload he would not be taking paternity leave for the birth of the couples fourth child instead he is expected to hop up and down stairs between home and office cutting his working hours but by no means handing over his duties completely yesterday ms booth told the court that it was impossible to put a price on the loss to parents who miss out on time with their children what they are losing is the right to family life she said that is very difficult to quantify in monetary terms similarly unquantifiable were the benefits to employers of a familyfriendly policy a more contented workforce a more committed workforce ms booth told lord bingham the lord chief justice and mr justice morison who are not expected to pass judgment for a week that to include the parents of children under five born before december would cost employers about m on top of the projected m over five years these figures were small beer compared with the bn cost of the minimum wage regulations said ms booth the cost to employees of taking unpaid leave would be m in lost income much greater than the cost to employers the governments claim that the burden on employers was already excessive was an exaggeration she said jonathan crow counsel for the trade and industry secretary said the eu directive referred to the right of workers to parental leave on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child therefore the entitlement to leave was triggered by the specific event of birth or adoption not by merely having responsibility for a child he said the tuc is likely to appeal if it loses the case and dti sources indicated the government might do the same if defeated tuc campaigners fear a worstcase scenario which would see the decision passed to the european court of justice effectively kicking the whole thing into the long grass according to one source,2000-05,heavilypregnant cherie booth yesterday proved thorn government side led impassioned

breakfast in the blair household must have been a tense affair this morning with the arrival of downing streets newest resident only days away cherie booth top employment lawyer and incidentally wife of the prime minister tony blair prepared to take on her husbands government in the high court over tuc claims that ministers have broken european law in excluding million working parents from new parental leave rights her husband meanwhile has just confided to the new york times that while he will reduce his workload around may the day his fourth child is due full paternity leave is not an option the first couples professional differences of opinion over familyfriendly working or worklife balance as the government now prefers to call it reflect tensions at the heart of the blair administration which have led to todays court case the row between unions and ministers centres on the fact that while the new labour government has gone much further than its tory predecessor in signing up to the european parental leave directive it has chosen to implement the law in a way many regard as minimal and deeply grudging the new right entitles each parent to take up to weeks off work to spend with their child up to its fifth birthday but the leave is unpaid and applies only to parents of children born before last december when the law was introduced ms booth qc in what will probably be her last court appearance before giving birth argued that the cutoff date was an unlawful restriction based on a false interpretation of the directive applying the right from december may be fine for the new blair baby but it excludes million working parents of older children according to the tuc including those parents in the scheme would cost employers around m which ms booth claimed was small beer compared with the bn cost of the minimum wage regulations the smart money is on ms booth and suggests that the government will lose the case although a judgment is not due for around a week either way the clash exposes the impossibility for the government of keeping business sweet the main concern of the department of trade and industry while simultaneously encouraging a familyfriendly culture in which parents are able to balance work and caring for their children those sympathising with the ministers dilemma should note that other eu countries have avoided becoming similarly bogged down in restrictions by opting from the first to abide by the spirit of the directive no other member state has attempted to introduce a cutoff date with the exception of ireland which has recently backed down after receiving an official opinion against the move from the european commission many other countries including italy and sweden have been more generous still making

it will be a comical sight next tuesday cherie booth only a couple of weeks from giving birth will stand up in the high court to attack the governments miserable policy on parental leave no wonder tony blair weaseled and wriggled when asked on the today programme if he planned to take any parental leave himself he claimed he hadnt thought about it if he said yes wed want to know if it was paid labour has refused to legislate for that if its unpaid then blair would just be one of the rich lucky few only the highestpaid people use unpaid leave so in the end he did a third way fudge and his spokesman said we are not talking about any days we are talking about him taking as much time as he possibly can he tends to work about four hours a day on his holidays quite why the government is going full steam ahead on this case is unclear to say nothing of mad ms booth representing the tuc will make a case that now looks almost unlosable the eus parental leave directive which labour brought in reluctantly and minimally gives all parents up to weeks off in the first five years of a childs life to cope with illness or crises stephen byers said that he wanted to ensure the goodwill of employers is maximised so he made it apply only to children born after december at a stroke that eliminated m parents rights the irish government tried the same trick but they have just lost a challenge in the european courts its an illegal restriction labour can expect the same rebuke but daftly the case continues costing taxpayers an arm and a leg so that the department of trade and industry can say to employers that its not their fault europe made them do it it wont lift the hearts of overworked voters this was national worklife balance week its not made great impact on the news agenda only a bit more than lupus awareness week which it also is but it has stirred the expected announcement that there will be a review of maternity and parental rights certain to recommend paid parental leave in time for the next manifesto it has taken the blair baby to force the issue for labours record on introducing better working conditions from european directives has hardly been inspiring the working time directive was a humble thing uncontroversial everywhere else britain alone demanded the right to drive workers beyond hours a week we work an average hours to the eus one in five of us works hours or more half of managers work most evenings and every other weekend british stress and unhappiness outstrip that of our neighbours in every eu survey labour encouraged this overwork tradition with a special clause allowing workers to volunteer to work more than hours other countries have optouts for highly paid posts but only britain has m workers signing voluntary waivers to work over hours many under unsubtle duress the parttime working directive aims to give all eu parttimers the same pay promotion and holiday rights as fulltime workers this government alone in the eu tried to make most of our m parttimers ineligible with a legal loophole only would have benefited the outcry made them retreat but theyve still refused to let parttimers compare their conditions with workers in equivalent jobs so a care worker can compare her pay and conditions with say the gardener working in the same care home labours parental leave law offered only unpaid leave it will hardly be used other countries pay it applies only after a year in a job so single mothers urged back to work wondering if they can hurry home in a crisis will be told yes of course but only in a years time britain is good at using small print to destroy the original purpose of a directive thats a pretty dismal record so far for labour overlaid on britains already bad working conditions our maternity pay is worse our time off is worse there is no paternity pay british governments seem uniquely terrified of employers at the expense of a workforce measurably the most unhappy in europe what do we have to show for it nothing at all we work longer but dumber our productivity is among the lowest in the eu our living standards and per capita income lower than all our main competitors and their growth rate is higher yet our government has the cheek to lecture them on their socialist dirigiste unreformed working practices their crippling unions and doomed future even as our factories close as foreign investors warn they are looking more to france and germany we boast about our unregulated labour market as we drop dead of overwork it has to stop the netherlands this year introduces the universal right to work parttime all workers can move at will between full and parttime most can work four days a week if they wish yes sensible flexibility has been built in to suit particular employers imagine the liberation of knowing that if and when you can afford it you have that choice without losing status or other rights choosing hours to suit your life cycle meanwhile in france the hour week which labour mocked so loudly looks as if it is working well unemployment is dropping fast very few employers are still complaining productivity and growth are rising steeply in a country far richer than us why not none of the better conditions abroad happened through government exhortation or goodwill from employers tony blairs mantra despite these countries good unionemployer cooperation it has always taken the law to effect change so all the governments waffle urging employers to do the right thing stephen byers speech for worklife balance week was a template of this airy nonsense wont lead to change if labour wants a civilised working life for its citizens then it has to face down the whingeing employers partly by stuffing their mouths with compensation as other countries do it needs proper wholehearted labour laws not labours legal colanders full of loopholes this weeks announcement of a review of all maternity and parental rights will discuss the vital right for women to return to work part time the review is bound to recommend paid parental leave the sum to be kept for the next manifesto the women running the review jay hodge primarolo and hollis are intent on a tough fight armed with the shocking new figures on how little effect the equal pay act has had on womens incomes there are five deregulation task forces to cut red tape round employers necks heres one to stop women being strangled by employers the next manifesto has to take these womens rights and turn them into a vision for civilising everyones work the whole qualityoflife happiness worklife agenda is there for the taking a new vista if labour is imaginative enough to seize it in years the country will be at least richer how can labour make us happier

theres this woman i know a doctor with three children shes been the sole breadwinner for the past eight years ever since her husband who once did something in business was made redundant and became clinically depressed he was so low he couldnt be trusted with the children so she had to pay for a nanny too well eventually it got so bad she couldnt take it anymore she suggested a trial separation off he went and before she had finished paying that months bills he had set up house down the road with one of her childrens playmates mothers his depression disappeared just like that he told my friend that proved beyond doubt that she was the cause of it and then get ready for it he told her that it was only fair if she did something to make up for it he had an idea for a new business and according to this poor excuse for a husband it was up to my friend to find the startup money thats not the worst story ive ever heard i know someone else a mother of two whos having to sell the marital home she got in her divorce settlement to put herself through a threeyear training course her aim is to become financially independent but it will be years she thinks before she gets back to her premotherhood salary level or maybe it will take longer because now it emerges that her ex is going to stop maintenance the moment she starts drawing any salary at all why should he bankrupt himself to support an independent woman and heres another one about a man this time hes been paying the mother of his only child double the maintenance required by the courts for years without missing a payment round about the time this girl finished her exams and left home this man had to take early medical retirement that same month he got a letter from a solicitor to tell him that his wife did not just want child maintenance payments to continue ad infinitum she wanted them to be doubled her reason simple she needed the money she also deserved it if it hadnt been for his bad behaviour theyd never have had to get divorced in the first place everyone who knows them would say that shes more or less right on this count but how does that translate into pounds and pence this woman has a job for goodness sake a job with a pension thats what his friends say what her friends say is that one salary is just not enough to keep a household going this is also true so whats fair it used to be so simple a good exhusband was a man who supported his wife until such a time as she remarried and a good exwife was someone who used that support to carry on being a good mother to their children this is not to say that all or even most divorcing couples managed to hold to the ideal still we were fairly clear about how to assign blame when they didnt but now with so many women working and some men becoming primary carers the rules of this game have blurred our ideas of fair play have gone out the window no one seems to know exactly who is responsible for what one thing is clear though some people suffer greater losses post divorce than do others its long been known in policy circles that women are more likely to suffer a drop in income immediately following a divorce this is usually because they have care of the children and so cannot easily jump into fulltime work most courts in this country take a rehabilitative approach in such cases in other words they encourage settlements that offer mothers with care of their children stability in the shortterm while encouraging them to become selfsupporting in the long term this is more or less in line with what most of us would think of as fair but a new study of recently divorced parents written by alison perry and gillian douglas and commissioned by the family policy studies centre and the joseph rowntree foundation gives us a rather stark view of what happens next two years after divorce the incomes of most of the men in the study were the same as they had been when they were married but nearly half of the women had not returned to their preseparation income levels many were having to scramble and borrow money from their families and they were twice as likely as the men to say they were having trouble making ends meet while there was strong agreement about how important it was to give children stability by keeping them in their original home half of the parents had not had the resources to see this fine idea through for many the question defining the divorce settlement had not been how to share the assets but how to share the debts the most disturbing finding in the study was the haphazard way in which most couples made these settlements only a few had been able to get good professional advice early on most did not retain solicitors until very late in the day often this was to avoid antagonising the other party there was a tendency perhaps related to go for informal arrangements thus only a quarter of the mothers with care of children had maintenance in the form of a court order while received voluntary maintenance on a regular basis and nonresident fathers often helped out with mortgage payments clothes holidays school fees and so on dependence of such goodwill arrangements meant that many women were financially insecure the very worst news in this report is that most had not thought carefully about how they were going to support themselves in old age this must be partly due to the fact that most of the mothers in the study were in their s and s and so were more concerned about keeping shoes on their childrens feet and roofs over their heads but life goes on and divorce is forever a fair divorce settlement according to john cornwell senior partner at dawson cornwell should be not just about income and assets and maintenance but also about pensions and longterm security indeed pension sharing is becoming a reality but it is still the accepted norm for the man to walk away with his pension and for the woman to go for arrangements that allow her to keep her head above water in the shortterm often this is not because the wicked man is hoodwinking her but because she herself is not fully aware of the issues in other words a lot of women are losing out in their divorce settlements because they do not get good advice but they could if they and their husbands went into mediation according to sheena adam chief executive of national family mediation most people go into mediation with highly unrealistic ideas about how much the other party earns or how much they need to make ends meet one of the jobs of the mediator is to go for full disclosure the mediator then puts the facts on a flip chart so that both parties can see the gap between appearance and reality often a woman will have not been involved with finances up until this point if this is the case the mediator will try to give her a clear idea about how the finances work once there has been a balancing of power in the negotiations the aim then is to come to an agreement about how to share out the money and the responsibilities here again the key word is balance theres no winning or losing the aim is to come up with an arrangement thats fair there are not nearly enough mediators out there to give advice to divorcing parents when they need it if there were we wouldnt be having to spend so much time fretting about fairness and we wouldnt have so many stories about friends who are shafted by their moneygrabbing exes the questions of etiquette and proper conduct would remain it will probably be decades before we have a clear idea about what a fair settlement looks like in a world where both men and women work and both men and women also care for their children but most of the horror stories you hear of come about because people are nave about money or dont anticipate problems or make vague arrangements based on unarticulated assumptions and leave too much too goodwill its because they fail to protect themselves in the beginning that so many people find themselves being treated unfairly later on with proper assistance at the right time they can reach fair solutions that last,2000-05,woman know doctor three child shes sole breadwinner past eight year ever since

ministers are considering giving women the option of continuing their jobs from home after having children the trade and industry secretary stephen byers will reveal today as the government comes under renewed pressure to improve new rights to parental leave in a speech outlining a review of the maternity and parental leave announced in the budget mr byers will make clear that the government could legislate to force employers to allow mothers to work in new ways he will indicate that higher maternity pay and a longer leave entitlement are likely outcomes of the review which will lead to a green paper in the autumn mr byers addressing a conference organised by the pressure group new ways to work is expected to say poor maternity benefits contribute to women returning to lowerskill jobs and reduced pay levels wasting skills and talent the review will also examine the case for paid paternity leave many companies allow new fathers a few days off though the leave is not always paid or guaranteed and many fathers use holiday entitlement it will consider whether a new right to weeks unpaid leave restricted to parents of children from birth to age five could be extended to cover children aged up to eight as in other european countries cherie booth qc will represent the tuc in a high court action next week challenging the government for denying the new entitlement to parents of children born before december the government is expected to lose the case since the european commission has just overturned a decision by the irish government to restrict implementation of the

millions more parents will get new rights on family friendly working after ministers opted to extend proposed improvements to include mothers of all children up to rather than just underfives ministers have accepted that the difficulties of balancing work and home life are as great or greater once children go to school and so will widen the application of proposed new rights such as an entitlement to work parttime to parents of preschool and schoolage youngsters the decision made at the first meeting of a ministerial review group on maternity rights and flexible working will be warmly welcomed by campaigners for a better deal for working parents however the extension is certain to anger business which already argues that government regulation increasing workers rights is excessive and burdensome if the review opts to take a tough line and enshrine new rights in legislation firms could be forced to allow all mothers of school age and preschool children to switch to parttime working companies are unlikely to be appeased by government pledges to make a powerful business case for more workplace flexibility the review group which is chaired by the trade and industry secretary stephen byers and includes womens ministers lady jay and tessa jowell and equal opportunities minister margaret hodge is charged with finding ways to help parents particularly women to combine work and family life so far the government has launched a worklife balance campaign to urge companies to introduce flexible work policies but is relying on coercion rather than legislation ministers have already privately indicated that the right to return to a job parttime after having a baby is being considered as a manifesto proposal for labours second term however the review groups implications now go even further by dramatically increasing the proportion of parents affected the group which is due to report in the autumn will decide whether to make the option of returning to work parttime or on a flexible basis perhaps including home working a legal right or whether to offer weaker options such as a strong presumption of flexible working unless a company can prove it would be difficult to offer it alternatively companies could be offered incentives to introduce better familyfriendly policies a primary reason for change ministers believe is that women at present leave work altogether after having children or go back too soon because of inadequate maternity pay and then swiftly leave their jobs anyway however campaigners for new familyfriendly rights are wary of the move to apply any changes to a wider group of parents the former social security secretary harriet harman campaigning from the backbenches on family policy said what would be totally unacceptable would be to do too little to improve maternity pay and leave which were the initial focus of this review the government must also be wary of talking up issues such as familyfriendly working and then failing to back that up with legislation she added working groups accreditation schemes and management handbooks will make absolutely no difference for the vast majority of britains

paternity leave came in with a bang at the end of last year and enjoyed a revival of interest with the birth of leo blair but apart from the prime minister has anyone taken any the short answer is that nobody seems to know even the pressure groups that monitor the issue closely admit no satisfactory information is available what is clear is that the biggest obstacle is financial worry a survey by online bank virgin one found a good deal of enthusiasm for the theory at least overall of fathers welcomed the introduction of paternity leave among younger fathers this rose to enthusiasm fades though in the face of the financial consequences saying they wont be taking paternity because they cant afford to a further would be reluctant to do so because work commitments preclude it the survey reflects the experience of the charity parents at work a spokeswoman says that since the change in the law it has had many enquiries about paternity leave but callers lose interest on learning that there will be no financial support financial expectations are generally modest the charity suggests that just would make some paternity leave viable for lowincome families and it says paternity leave should be paid on the same basis as maternity leave with government provision to help small businesses it would also like to see more flexibility with perhaps one day a week over several weeks being an option rather than one week here or there as yet this is available only to the fathers of children with disabilities but it is early days as recently as parents at work was known as the working mothers association it seems it will take some time to establish that the issue affects both sexes,2000-07,paternity leave came bang end last year enjoyed revival interest birth leo blair apart prime minister ha anyone taken short answer nobody seems know even pressure group monitor issue closely admit satisfactory information available clear biggest obstacle financial worry survey online bank virgin one found good deal enthusiasm theory least overall father welcomed introduction paternity leave among younger father rose enthusiasm fade though face financial consequence saying wont taking paternity cant afford would reluctant work commitment preclude survey reflects experience charity parent work spokeswoman say since change law ha many enquiry paternity leave caller lose interest learning financial support financial expectation generally modest charity suggests would make paternity leave viable lowincome family say paternity leave paid basis maternity leave government provision help small business would also like see flexibility perhaps one day week several week option rather one week yet available father child disability early day recently parent work wa known working mother association seems take time establish issue affect sex,"['paternity', 'leave', 'came', 'bang', 'end', 'last', 'year', 'enjoyed', 'revival', 'interest', 'birth', 'leo', 'blair', 'apart', 'prime', 'minister', 'ha', 'anyone', 'taken', 'short', 'answer', 'nobody', 'seems', 'know', 'even', 'pressure', 'group', 'monitor', 'issue', 'closely', 'admit', 'satisfactory', 'information', 'available', 'clear', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'financial', 'worry', 'survey', 'online', 'bank', 'virgin', 'one', 'found', 'good', 'deal', 'enthusiasm', 'theory', 'least', 'overall', 'father', 'welcomed', 'introduction', 'paternity', 'leave', 'among', 'younger', 'father', 'rose', 'enthusiasm', 'fade', 'though', 'face', 'financial', 'consequence', 'saying', 'wont', 'taking', 'paternity', 'cant', 'afford', 'would', 'reluctant', 'work', 'commitment', 'preclude', 'survey', 'reflects', 'experience', 'charity', 'parent', 'work', 'spokeswoman', 'say', 'since', 'change', 'law', 'ha', 'many', 'enquiry', 'paternity', 'leave', 'caller', 'lose', 'interest', 'learning', 'financial', 'support', 'financial', 'expectation', 'generally', 'modest', 'charity', 'suggests', 'would', 'make', 'paternity', 'leave', 'viable', 'lowincome', 'family', 'say', 'paternity', 'leave', 'paid', 'basis', 'maternity', 'leave', 'government', 'provision', 'help', 'small', 'business', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'see', 'flexibility', 'perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'week', 'several', 'week', 'option', 'rather', 'one', 'week', 'yet', 'available', 'father', 'child', 'disability', 'early', 'day', 'recently', 'parent', 'work', 'wa', 'known', 'working', 'mother', 'association', 'seems', 'take', 'time', 'establish', 'issue', 'affect', 'sex']",44
youve seen the headlines working mothers damage do not damageimprove childrens prospects delete as appropriate taking into account political slant of the publication a slew of studies each apparently contradicting the one before has attempted to track the development of children whose mothers work what is striking about these studies and the stories that follow is their complacent sexism an alien visiting from planet utopia where men and women are equals in all spheres might puzzle for a while over the headlines mmm surely there is someone missing from this picture who could it be oh yes thats right my olevel biology is coming back to me the father never is the research written up as the impact of working parents the unshakeable presumption is that children have just two options paidfor care or mothercare fathers are simply discounted and we wonder why women are at a disadvantage in the labour market we wonder why the pay gap remains stubbornly open we wonder why there is only one women ceo in the ftse sadly this sexism spans the political spectrum progressive historian eric hobsbawm has this to say in his latest work the new century i think that successes for women in the workplace have been satisfactory there is however a serious problem the extraordinary difficulties of combining high professional posts with being mothers this has nothing to do with discrimination but with the natural law that women are the ones who give birth actually professor it has everything to do with discrimination there is a discriminatory view that because women carry children they are necessarily the prime carers while men sail on in their careers of course there are some things women can do in parenting terms that men cannot they can i breastfeed ii er iii thats it actually but parenting is a decadeslong complex multiskilled job fathers can bond as closely as mothers with their children they can read stories wipe tears noses and bums help with homework teach swimming sing songs advise on first dates lend cars and write cheques for university tuition fees we are a long way from headlines warning that working dads are damaging their children but some new research takes us at least a step closer to a more balanced view christopher ruhm in a paper for the national bureau of economic research in the us has for the first time looked at the impact on child cognitive development of both parents working first he finds that children with working mothers especially in the first year have slightly lower verbal skills at the age of three and weaker reading ability at the age of five ruhm then examines the influence of fathers employment and finds almost identical trends he concludes time investments of mothers and fathers have qualitatively similar effects on children raising the possibility of substitution across parents in other words all the stories about working mothers need to be edited to read working parents in other words fathers can do just as good a job at home as mothers the automatic association of femininity with family is of course damaging for women women are the ones who are made to feel guilty if they work and their child goes to nursery even though their partner works as well and probably for much longer hours until we rethink our attitudes to childcare and take it out of the gender ghetto women will continue to have to fight harder than men to make it to the top of their professions if that is they have children for many women a desire to make it to the top makes children a luxury they can ill afford nine out of male yearold executives in the us have children only a third of yearold females at the same level do these figures are an indictment of our outdated approach to gender and childrearing for all the talk of a new britain and a new century the gendered division of labour remains fixed in concrete embedded in law and replicated in business practice theodore zeldin described the th century as the first in

was it something i said last week i published a paper arguing that women lose out at work because they shoulder a disproportionate share of childcare responsibility and that employers knowing this rationally discriminate against them i therefore proposed that men be offered paternity leave which matches in time and money current maternity provision women and men would then compete on a level playing field the institute of directors said the plans would be devastating to business the telegraph argued that men werent interested anyway this newspaper described the scheme as close to utopian and a waste of legislative effort the tuc said it amounted to an attack on a better deal for working mothers the cabinet office said the report was nonsense most damning of all the department of trade and industry said it was a valuable contribution to the debate ouch rightwing criticisms are easily dealt with yes there would be some impact on business although not a large financial one as i suggest the paternity leave payments be reclaimed from the exchequer as maternity payments are the truth is that the shortestsighted and loudest end of the business lobby have opposed every move to increase time off for workers on the grounds that it would destroy businesses they are always wrong they said it about the fiveday week the eighthour day paid holidays extended maternity rights and parental leave the other argument made from the right but also by some feminists is that a mans place is not in the home because women are intrinsically better carers advocates of this view point out that it is widely held i suppose they mean in the same way that popular opinion was once against female emancipation the idea that men just arent built to care for children belongs in the dustbin of history the attacks from the left are trickier nobody in government or the trade unions is prepared to say publicly that so long as women take more time off than men employers have rational grounds for discrimination plenty of them agree in private needless to say but think admitting it openly would encourage employers in this behaviour i agree with you said one trade union official but you cant say it it plays into the hands of the right this is an absurd situation everyone knows it is happening but progressives close their eyes to it the cabinet office said it was nonsense to suggest that employers discriminate against women because of their role as mothers what employers are the cabinet office talking to has anybody put a lie detector on them we have to face up to the real impact of the gendered division of labour in our society and then do something about it the bias against women wont just go away no matter how hard we huff and puff the tuc description of my ideas as an attack on a better deal for working mothers was odd to say the least especially from john monks an intelligent forwardlooking man how does this square with my proposal for a doubling in the amount of time off available to parents at a cost of around bn a year helping working fathers is the best way to help working mothers by reducing their share of the domestic workload the tuc is an exemplary employer in this area offering male staff three weeks of paid paternity leave i simply want fathers who are not fortunate enough to be tuc employees to enjoy the same or greater rights the best argument against my scheme is that men will not take up the offered leave and that legislative and political energy should therefore go towards giving mothers more time off because theyll actually use it for childcare rather than golf the problem is that every time maternity leave is increased and time off for fathers stands still the gap between mothers and fathers yawns even more widely unless we start equalising the treatment of fathers and mothers soon the gap will be too wide to even contemplate it and until we do women will inevitably be at a disadvantage at work in any case whats to be lost if the government introduces more generous paternity leave and men shun it no money or time will have been lost business will be as usual and i will have to eat a large slice of humble pie but i think i can glimpse a world where women and men meet as equals in the workplace and act as equals in the home maybe it is utopian i can live with that richard reeves is director of futures at the industrial society you can contact him at rreevesindsoccouk,2000-08,wa something said last week published paper arguing woman lose work shoulder disproportionate share childcare responsibility employer knowing

women will suffer even more discrimination at work if the government goes ahead with plans to extend maternity leave without offering equivalent fathers rights the industrial society warns today in an outspoken attack on ministers attempts to promote familyfriendly policies it would be entirely rational for employers to recruit men instead of women if they took the cost of the governments proposals for improved maternity rights into account the society says its intervention comes as ministers are beginning preparations on labours next election manifesto which is expected to make an eightweek extension of maternity leave the centrepiece of a strategy to woo women voters every extension of maternity rights that is not matched by an equivalent extension of paternity rights is a step in the wrong direction every such move gives employers a rational reason to choose bob over mary and seals half the workforce into the womanequalsmotherequalscarer trap the society says in the first report of a series entitled future provocations unlike many previous criticisms of equal opportunities policies which have come from a rightwing free market perspective it was written by richard reeves a former adviser to labour ministers and leftleaning journalist he said last night for the first time in the year history of alevels girls have gained a higher proportion of the top three grades than boys but that success is not going to translate into workplace success unless we break down the roles attached to motherhood and fatherhood the government the equal opportunities commission the tuc and most groups campaigning for parents all make the same mistake of thinking that the pay gap between men and women is irrational and some stern talking will do the trick in fact given the current policies and gender roles it is entirely rational and no amount of talking will do the trick the report includes the results of a survey of parents showing that of mothers were usually called first if a child was ill compared to of fathers the society is calling for parental leave to be paid at of wages for six weeks arguing that if the government were to offer a flat rate of around a week high income fathers would not be encouraged to take time off to look after their children by and large it is betteroff men who run businesses and therefore set the tone for organisations in terms of the acceptability of time off for childcare there is little hope of attitudes changing if the men dictating workplace cultures are not taking time off the report says last night the government denied its policies were biased towards protecting women at work a cabinet office spokeswoman said this government has done more than any other government to ensure that both mothers and fathers can effectively balance their work and home lives it is nonsense to suggest that womens role as mothers makes them less attractive to employers more women are working than ever before making up nearly half the workforce double the number years ago since the proportion of mothers with children under five who are in paid work has increased from to she added womens skills are vital to the success of uk plc businesses recognise that it is in the interests of their bottom line to ensure that women reach their full potential good successful companies recognise that if they offer flexible working practices they will get a more loyal and motivated workforce this will increase their productivity and give them a competitive edge both women and men are demanding a better balance between work and home life that is why the government has started a review looking at how working parents both men and women can be given more choice to help them balance their work and family life,2000-08,woman suffer even

the government will face acute embarrassment this week when a leading workplace thinktank will accuse new labour of encouraging employers to discriminate against women a report from the industrial society will say that the governments obsession with workplace concessions for mothers unmatched by benefits for fathers is forcing companies to avoid employing women altogether wherever possible familyfriendly has come to mean motherfriendly under this government said the industrial societys richard reeves it has further reinforced the divide between men who are seen not to have family responsibilities and women who are seen as having them mothers versus men to be published on wednesday will say that employment discrimination against women now makes more managerial and economic sense than ever before since labour was elected in a catalogue of policies has been promised to help working mothers maternity leave is soon expected to rise to one year from weeks some of which is paid the is believes that longer leave for mothers without a similar concession for fathers will make it even less attractive for companies to employ women since last december both men and women are also entitled to take up to weeks leave in the first five years of a childs life that change was introduced by european directive not by whitehall at least the political right who argue that women earn less because they have children have an intellectually coherent argument said reeves the government is peddling a fiction that women can be mothers at work competing equally with men the report will be accompanied by a survey showing that women with childcare responsibilities are treated much more sympathetically by employers who expect them to take time off but the price of tolerance is often lower pay and less training men who need to look after a sick child are likely to ring in sick themselves rather than admit that they have problems at home women are becoming intrinsically disadvantaged at work because of the role they are expected to perform as mothers said reeves men should be expected to take time off too the is will say that the only way to redress the balance is to provide equal treatment for parents regardless of sex however the cost of partly paid paternity leave for millions of fathers would almost certainly be opposed by the treasury if we are serious as a society about equality said reeves then we have to address the difference between the ability of mothers and fathers to compete in the workplace the government is taking an untenable position when it simultaneously calls for poundforpound gender equality in the workplace and in the next breath further cements women into a unique role as primary carers of children it doesnt add up tony blairs macho decision not to take time off work for the birth of his new baby leo last may will also attract criticism the prime minister was presented with an ideal opportunity to send a clear message about the importance of fatherhood in terms of spending time with chil dren rather than just bringing in the money said reeves when he became a father again he said that being prime minister was the kind of job which prevented him having time off the problem is that lots of men feel like that about their job and the simple truth is that theres no more important job than being a parent a labour spokesman insisted our policies are the product of an extensive listening to women campaign everyone who is trying to help women reach equality recognises that its not a smooth process ministers for women baroness jay and tessa jowell are responsible for championing family policy in whitehall they have already been embarrassed twice this year after promoting tony blairs humiliating appearance before the womens institute conference and after backing a summit on female body image which produced a crop of unflattering headlines the industrial society was founded years ago to promote better workplace practice its first major campaign was to secure the provision of lavatories in factories it provides training and advice to many of britains leading companies

britains million workers have received a substantial boost in the last few years as a raft of employment law reforms set a minimum wage protected parttimers helped the disabled and introduced many other valuable benefits but for many workers the changes are theoretical and have not improved their lives perhaps the worst aspect of the employment infrastructure is a lack of enforcement by the government and a refusal by businesses to observe the new regulations the problem is huge says the low pay unit which sends floods of unhappy workers to get help from citizens advice bureaux employment law is getting so complex that many employees do not appreciate their own rights today for instance could be a red letter day for some women even though few probably realise it in a change to our notoriously complicated maternity rules many women whose babies were expected to be born from today will get a more generous entitlement to maternity pay and leave a new mother can now receive weeks pay and leave even if she has worked for her employer for less than two years until now those with shorter service were only entitled to weeks the maternity allowance a weekly payment for mothers earning between and a week also becomes more generous but claimants have to have pay slips going back for more than a year to calculate the amount due to them and many employers break the law by not issuing any one of the easiest issues to deal with is the minimum wage an hour for workers aged over and for those aged between and the inland revenue polices this legislation through a compliance department if an employer is paying too little workers can ring a hotline number and demand an investigation the revenue has put right many wrongs in this way but it takes a narrow view of its job if the employer has committed a breach of contract say by reducing an employees hours to meet the hourly rate threshold the revenue will not investigate the issue since superficially the law is being obeyed but having compliance officers is very rare for any legislation in most areas the only help given with enforcement by the government is the chance to claim at an employment tribunal jeff masters of the low pay unit says this is only a last resort informal ways of enforcing your rights are always the best ways the employment relationship is still a relationship going to an employment tribunal can be like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut the advice bureaux tend to agree employers can turn nasty and dismiss you says one adviser so if you win in an employment tribunal it could be a pyrrhic victory and in most cases perhaps seven out of a worker will be looking for a reference which is going to be harder to get in these circumstances and the next employer might not look favourably on someone who took their last employer to a tribunal many employees who are getting shortchanged have little ability to fight back according to anna barlow of the acton law shop a free advisory service in west london their english might not be good or they might be working illegally a lot of people just decide to keep their head down and put up with it she says it is not just the traditional cowboy employers who are breaking the law a church cleaner of years standing recently accepted an outofcourt settlement from her employer a baptist church which was paying her only a week for work that she said took hours since the church also provided accommodation it regarded the payments to her as just pocket money many honest middle class families in britain may be shocked to discover that they are breaking the law in the way they deal with their cleaners even if they assume that ms mopp is selfemployed a tribunal could easily decide differently anna barlow who is dealing with one such claim now believes that people who retain cleaners or gardeners should pay the minimum wage give notice if they want to end the relationship and consider giving four weeks paid holiday a year it depends on the facts of each case she says the likelihood is that these issues wont be raised by the cleaners but if something goes wrong you could find yourself in front of a tribunal at the very least there should be a discussion with the cleaner about the issue of employment the good news for some employees is that certain issues can be resolved just by providing the employer with more information small businesses in particular may not appreciate the way the law has changed there is a common misapprehension for instance that employees do not get rights to paid holiday in their first three months of employment while it is true that they cannot claim paid holidays if they leave after three months they are entitled retrospectively to the full four weeks of paid holiday once they have been with the same employer for months barlow has found that many employers are happy to do the right thing in these circumstances once they know what it is many employees will get what is due only if they educate their bosses like all pieces of new legislation the regulations protecting parttimers will not have been implemented by all employers when they came into force at the beginning of july but they do provide the right for parttimers to have the same hourly pay rate as fulltimers doing the same job this sadly is where the law is letting down many people some jobs like those of school dinner ladies are only ever done on a parttime basis and this law has not been drawn up in a way that will help them it will take years for the employment revolution that started with these reforms to be completed those who want to benefit may have to find their own ways of enforcing the new laws low pay unit helpline work for mr d odgy if you do not want to be shortchanged by your bosses a good start is to recognise a cowboy employer and get out fast here are some of the signs of shady operators they operate under a range of business names there is headed notepaper in the office giving different business names for the same employer although you know them as smellie cars they also seem to do business as cowboy cabs and dodgy drivers although there could be innocent explanations they may also be specialists in running up debts under one limited company and then transferring the remnants of the business to another the name of the employer shown on your payslip is one you do not recognise you have rights which you can claim against your employer but if you have no knowledge of the m mouse ltd mentioned on your payslip you may have difficulty enforcing those rights in some unscrupulous setups people and companies are named as employers even though they live in a different country and have no real connection with the business sometimes they are merely the brother of the true owner which provides a useful escape route for anyone wanting to avoid debts they have run up they do not give you payslips you have a legal right to a payslip they are reluctant to give you the written employment contract which is your legal right since a contract sets out the basis for your relationship you are on very rocky territory if you do not have a written record of the basic terms bosses find it far easier to cut your hours or pay for instance if there is nothing on paper know your rights main employee protections your contract you have a basic right to a written employment contract giving details such as hours place of work and pay you are also entitled to pay slips pay anyone aged or over must be paid at least an hour rising to in october those aged to get a minimum of some groups are excluded among them au pairs prisoners and family members working in a family business sick pay you are entitled to receive statutory sick pay if you earn more than a week if your employer runs a more generous scheme than the statutory minimum a flat rate of a week you could get more holidays you are due four weeks paid holiday a year hours in most jobs you cannot be forced to work more than an average of hours a week but the rules are complicated there are many other rules on length of shifts working days and rights to breaks maternity pay the rules are a nightmare of complexity but all working mothers are entitled to weeks maternity leave most women will qualify for statutory maternity pay or maternity allowance many employers offer more generous schemes than the statutory minimum you cannot be discriminated against because you are pregnant or have a family although there are in reality many instances of women being fired parental leave if you have worked for your employer for more than a year you qualify for weeks of unpaid parental leave to be taken before your newborn is five although the rules apply to mothers and fathers few men are expected to take it since the leave is unpaid health and safety your employer should by law provide a healthy and safe working environment many employers even the largest ones are in breach of their obligations under the detailed hamps rules the tuc estimates that million people a year are injured at work discrimination discrimination on grounds of sex or race is unlawful although there are no special legal provisions to tackle discrimination on grounds of age religion or sexual orientation in theory there is no cap on the damages available through an employment tribunal but apart from a few headline cases damages are rarely spectacular the fact that women on average earn just per cent of male salaries is dealt with separately under the equal pay act the remedy is equal pay not unlimited damages redundancy there are intricate rules governing statutory redundancy pay for workers of two years standing the minimum depends on your age salary level and length of employment with

a pledge to extend maternity rights to every woman in fulltime employment will be included in labours election manifesto as the party promises to deliver the most sweeping changes to parental rights since the second world war downing street and the treasury have thrown their collective weight behind the reform which will step up the fight against child poverty by ensuring that no mother is denied full maternity rights the proposal will be one of the main recommendations of a ministerial review group which is examining ways of improving parental rights ministers will also recommend extending maternity leave from the current weeks possibly to a year and increasing the weekly flat rate statutory maternity pay of possibly to ministers on the special crossdepartmental group are determined to ensure that their reforms do not just benefit middleclass parents but are aimed at mothers across the board one of their proposals will ensure that women who do not earn enough to merit statutory maternity pay smp will win the right to the weekly payment women who have not met the strict criteria for maternity rights they have to be in fulltime employment for weeks before the start of pregnancy will also receive smp one minister on the review group said the government was concerned that women who lose out on maternity rights tend to slip out of the employment market after the birth of their child we are very concerned that the less well paid do not have any maternity provision the minister said they are more likely to leave work altogether and go back into benefits if we are to tackle child poverty we must keep mothers connected with work the reform will build on reforms introduced by gordon brown in when he lowered the threshold to women earning between and a week the review will recommend the abolition of the threshold benefiting thousands of women the chancellor set up the parental review group because maternity pay has fallen in real terms in the past years and is now less than half the eu average women currently receive of their pay for the first six weeks of maternity leave this is reduced to a flat rate of for the next weeks the governments reforms will include extending the period of statutory maternity leave from weeks possibly to a year increasing the weekly flat rate smp payment of this could be graded giving fathers two weeks paid parental leave immediately after the birth of their child offering help to mothers who want to work from home after the birth of their child the trade and industry secretary stephen byers whose department is leading the ministerial review said the government can and should do more we want all parents to be able to balance more easily the demands of work with caring for their children he told the guardian ministers on the review group are determined to win over business leaders such as the confederation of british industry who have issued dire threats of the dangers of imposing more regulations however business will not be given a veto mr byers who will speak about the parental rights review in his speech at the labour conference today said our present discussions and consultations are aimed at achieving a broad consensus for a package which provides real choice for parents whilst at the same time not adversely affecting the competitiveness of business ministers will tell business that it is in their interests to improve maternity rights to ensure that skilled women return to the labour market ministers have been impressed by the generous scheme offered by boots which ensures that of women return to work after pregnancy maternity rights campaigners are worried that the pressure on the chancellor to cut taxes in the wake of the fuel protests may lessen the chances of real change

women at a crowded fringe meeting at the labour conference this week were reassured to hear cherie booth say that she frequently discusses the balance between work and home life at the downing street kitchen table with her husband and teenage children what was less reassuring was how much of a constant struggle she found such a balance and how she suspected it probably always would be struggle may be a true description of the high profile blair household but it has been a central plank of the campaign for better maternity and paternity rights for more than two decades that there is no reason why it should be the case for millions of other families indeed campaigners argue that it is perfectly possible to remove the element of constant struggle from family life it is simply a matter of sensible policies there is no reason why participation in the labour market should be at the cost of children or marriages there is now clear evidence that the government has broadly accepted their case on the need for reform of maternity and paternity rights stephen byers trade and industry secretary who is leading the ministerial review on the issue admits that maternity rights provision is inadequate lagging up to years behind provision in many european states the battle is no longer over whether there should be reform but what form it should take it is at the birth of a child that these livability issues as they are known in political jargon are most sharply defined and the battle is greatest this is one of the most physically and emotionally demanding times of womens lives yet they are entitled to only six weeks leave at of their salary followed by statutory maternity pay of a week for weeks harriet harman labours most vocal champion of improved maternity rights argues that smp is too low for many of the poorest paid women in a report commissioned by the knitwear footwear and textiles union the former social security secretary said she found women factory workers returning to work six weeks after the birth often having to give up breastfeeding as a consequence their stories are heartrending said ms harman who is lobbying for one years paid maternity leave to be a labour manifesto pledge for the next election christine gowdridge of the maternity alliance pinpointed the most significant shift which policymakers had to recognise womens participation in the labour market was no longer for a bit of extra pin money but was a crucial contribution to the family income in the past years this change has accelerated in of women went back to work seven years later it had leapt to the significance for the policymakers is twofold first unless income is properly protected the leave is not taken britain is theoretically generous on maternity leave most women can take up to weeks but unless there are savings or a partners income that can support the family few women take the full entitlement people just cant afford to take time off if it is unpaid said richard dunstan of the national association of citizens advice bureaux unpaid leave was a perk for the rich said ms gowdridge so the priority for reform is more leave at full pay said the maternity alliance this argument is also used against unpaid parental leave the experience across europe has been that takeup rates particularly among men are poor unless it is paid properly this year ruth kelly labour mp for bolton west produced a pamphlet calling for a flatrated parental leave rate of a week which mr byers went out of his way to praise second the dramatic shift in womens work patterns has been crucial in persuading the chancellor gordon brown and the treasury that reform on maternity provision is needed what concerned the treasury was that women at the lowest end of the pay scale had the most inadequate rights higher earners benefit from contractual company schemes yet they are crucial to the governments commitment to end child poverty maryann stephenson of the fawcett society said enhanced maternity rights encourage women to stay in paid work and in the long run that saves the treasury money because women dropping out of the labour market are more likely to go on to benefits they are also not building up a pension plus if women take a break when they go back to work they take a job at a lower level and lower pay women workers end up being deskilled and that is a loss of productivity for the economy these arguments are likely to carry weight with mr byerss review because its remit gives priority to how maternity provision affects economic competitiveness and productivity what concerns child welfare campaigners is that the review does not include anyone with a child welfare brief either from the department of health or the home office they claim it makes nonsense of joinedup government campaigners fear that the government will miss the opportunity for radical reform because it is frightened by the business lobby which has declared its vehement opposition the government insists it will not allow business a veto but there are worrying signs that the review will come up with only some cheap symbolism two weeks of paid parental leave is one

carried him inside me for nine months longing to be with him and then had to tear myself away she breastfed her son before leaving for work and when she got home it was terrible trying to wean him when things were going so well i would have loved to have been able to stay with my child for the first year of his life but that would only have been possible if id received pay after the statutory weeks to have had a week would have allowed me to have stayed at home ann hallam and her partner took out a loan with a credit union eight weeks into her maternity leave to enable her to stay off work a further eight weeks we were extremely careful and just got by but as soon as the money stopped i had to go back both she and her partner each earn a year ms hallam was entitled to of her a month salary for the first six weeks and half of that for the remaining weeks of her leave i changed the way i shopped and went to the supermarket daily looking for bargains and special offers i didnt even consider buying clothes she said she enjoyed her job as a housing officer in salford greater manchester but leaving her son dominic when he was four months old to return to work was traumatic my son was so young and vulnerable and part of me felt very guilty about leaving him i was starting to feel tuned into my son and his needs i felt i knew what he wanted and although i trusted the person

the equal pay act should be celebrating its th birthday this year what it is more likely to be doing is commiserating as study after study shows that british women who work fulltime still earn less than threequarters of mens salaries why a new report by the industrial society blames male managers the fact that most decision makers within organisations are male is likely to be perpetuating male ideas about the superiority of male working patterns and male performance at work claims the research may smith an occupational psychologist specialising in gender agrees men are still seen as the main breadwinners and women as secondary earners in consequence better paid jobs are given to men she says it doesnt help that most parttime workers are women she adds the ideal and therefore the best paid employee is seen as having a singleminded commitment to work prepared to work long hours and overtime whenever required the majority of people who have this attitude are men susan block of hay management consultants coaches women into higher salaries she blames the fact that being aggressive ambitious and pushy is often rewarded in men and criticised in women we cant win she says if were too assertive we are seen as not doing our job properly because weve got ideas above our station and if were too nice which women are in fact socialised to be in the workplace we are seen as a pushover both help leave women at the bottom of the pay and promotion pile the equal opportunities commission believes women suffer at two levels on an individual basis they are paid differently for the same job and on a collective level womendominated professions are almost always paid less than maledominated professions says chair julie mellor secretarial work is a classic example its only since men have reentered the field that salaries are rising significantly confirms a spokesperson for the recruitment consultancy manpower research consistently shows however that despite these discrepancies women tend to be less preoccupied with salary and status than men instead women are often more concerned with job satisfaction and receiving nonfinancial perks such as familyfriendly hours and ongoing training says marilyn davidson professor of managerial psychology at the university of science and technology in manchester this means that unlike men they often dont ask for salary increases and in todays marketplace if you dont ask you dont get worse still the industrial society report points out its simply not the done thing to ask someone what salary theyre on unless you share a house or better still a bedroom even at job interviews potential recruits squirm in their seats at the very thought of bringing up the money factor the result is that you are left without a clue what your secretarial colleague ben is paid and in turn your employer is able to get away with paying you significantly less than him in fact universums latest survey claims this veil of secrecy surrounding paypackets means that todays female graduates are more likely than ever to expect and therefore to demand less than men the survey found the average woman anticipates earning a month less than her male peers in her first job and a staggering a month less five years later it gets worse as she gets older says a spokeswoman for the industrial society in her early s a woman earns about of a mans pay in her s in her s and in her s employees should be confident enough to share their personal salary details with each other as a way of exposing discriminatory pay gaps she concludes if from such discussions you suspect you are being paid less because youre female ask your personnel department to provide you with a scatter diagram showing the spread of pay identified by sex so that you can see where you are then advises the industrial society objectively assess your strengths and capability in relation to the organisations needs its a good idea to get a colleague a male one is helpful to get a different perspective to help you make that assessment at this point use your information from personnel on pay together with salary figures for similar posts in the job pages to set

its a typical slice of daily life at the palmfringed hub of the new economy a workplace undoubtedly but one where an unusual definition of work holds sway engineers are chasing each other down the hallways firing softtipped darts from nerf guns their programmer colleagues are busy playing table football or hunched over videogames and when real work begins it is as likely to take the form of a bug bash where programmers stay in the office long into the night until they have fixed a certain number of glitches in the system as it is a conventional meeting or at least this is what the male ones are doing these are scenes from valley of the boys a documentary by monika khushf director of engineering at the software company intuit which alarmed many by demonstrating just how maledominated silicon valleys working culture really is khushf interviewing male and female engineers from major technology companies including sun microsystems apple computers and netscape portrayed a workplace where men spend long hours weekends included constructing elaborate model cities in lego while their female colleagues look on depressed or simply resigned theyre having a great old time one woman told khushf and im sitting there going oh please these women would not be surprised by a new list of the most influential people in the valley compiled by the san jose mercury its leading newspaper not one woman made the top and in britain were no better our three biggest internet companies freeserve the auction site qxl and the software firm autonomy have one woman director between them in any sector this would be a cause for concern but in the supposedly revolutionary crucible of ebusiness where casually attired workers pride themselves on abandoning the hangups of the old economy it is little short of a disaster its not as if there arent any women entrepreneurs to begin with according to the national foundation of women business owners the number of womenowned businesses in the us has more than doubled in the past decade indeed american women seem positively fuelinjected when it comes to startups they are launching businesses at twice the rate of their male counterparts but it is becoming increasingly clear that the old boys network that has been consigned to history is being replaced by a new one focused on the venture capitalists who provide the speculative backing for the valleys big ideas insiders like to portray the new economy as running on little but caffeine and ideas but of course deep down it runs on cash and here a new boys network is vigorously asserting itself according to venture one an organisation that provides information to venture capitalists only of the total venture capital funding in the states goes to companies with women chief executives of the venture capitalists currently working in the us only are women says diana reid of the san franciscobased forum for women entrepreneurs you do the math as they say in san jose reid and others are starting to mobilise the valleys women in a movement that includes women in technology international which holds an annual silicon valley summit in santa clara and a range of incubators such as the san franciscobased womens technology cluster which aims specifically to nurture technology startups run by women not that you will ever get anyone in the politicsfree valley to admit to being an activist we dont consider ourselves to be an affirmativeaction group says reid were just trying to jumpstart excellent business plans in britain the situation is even worse when it comes to venture capital funding lucy marcus who set up hightechwomencom to support women in technologyrelated fields by mentoring and networking says there are a pitiful number of women venture capitalists working in london i can name them without running out of fingers she says launched in march this year high techwomen already boasts members recent months have also witnessed the launch of busygirlcouk the first business technology portal dedicated to women internet entrepreneurs and webgrrlsorguk another networking organisation in the uk getting vc finance is made more difficult because the vcs in town have always been traditional city boys of the oldschool network says may chong of webgrrls they are men who have very little experience of doing business with women let alone women who are younger and more techy than them the bestknown american exception to all this is carly fiorina the chief executive of hewlettpackard and the first woman to head one of americas largest companies as measured by revenues recently named by fortune magazine as the most powerful woman in business she sees the gender divide as part of a wider problem of conformity exactly the personality trait that most valley entrepreneurs expend energy trying to deny diversity needs to become a priority in the hitech industry fiorina says right now there is a virtual wall between available talent and available jobs diversity is not a hiring practice nor a hiring priority in many silicon valley companies this combined with the lessthanopen perspective of many hiring managers means says fiorina that this industry has far too much conformity strenuous attempts are being made to change things the american computer experience for example offers free places to girls on its computer camps predictably computer summer camps are dominated by boys only of campers are girls other educational projects seek to educate the educators surveys show that girls are put off computing by dull programming classes dominated by nerdy boys nursing violent videogames and an inability to communicate in anything other than computer programming languages wendy tan is one of the lucky british women to be shown the

she says of the businesses in the investment portfolio of their major backer the investmentfund firm europweb tan says she is the only female boss ultimately the valleys unstoppable appetite for talent may force change says carolyn leightton founder and chair of women in technology international as the demand for talented technologists grows and the supplies continue to shrink those companies which are committed to removing the barriers for the advancement of women will certainly be the winners although it may be drowned out by the sound of the tablefootball games and the nerfgun shootouts

employers should put an end to a burnout britain where millions of employees work the longest hours in europe and should stop whinging about red tape john monks tuc general secretary said yesterday his call came as the tucs annual congress demanded fresh legislation to boost workers rights including measures to protect staff from unpaid overtime worth at least bn to employers each year a tuc survey estimated that at least m employees regularly work more than five hours extra unpaid a week with half of these working on days off and m saying work stress makes them irritable and bad tempered at home unions told employers to stop complaining about the multimillion pound cost of employment protection sums dwarfed by the value of unpaid overtime delegates overwhelmingly backed a motion demanding a new raft of measures to extend union rights at work including paid parental leave the tuc called for an end of the opting out of the eus working time directive limiting the working week to hours it said one in eight employees more than m was still working more than hours and the directive has failed to reduce the hours of of workers on very long hours to below a report by the national association of citizens advice bureaux found that many employers are also avoiding giving the full weeks of paid holiday to which workers were entitled under the directive the tuc said official figures suggesting unpaid overtime is worth bn to employers were an underestimate with managers contributing more than free each year professionals over and even the lowest paid upwards of mr monks ridiculed employer bodies for inflating the cost of protective measures saying the cost of unpaid parental leave was p per employee a week and better maternity provision p per woman of child bearing age he said the government should be robust in the face of employer opposition to modest improvements they should promote the benefits of necessary regulation and point out the dangers and costs of a lack of regulation employers should stop whinging about the wrong things and start worrying about the right ones i say to the cbi less complaining more cooperating he said lets help people work smarter not longer lets forge a better balance between work and family life lets look at how we can get the economy to grow faster and get to full employment lets ask how we can create more world class firms and how we can build better public services a regional breakdown of the tuc survey showed that workers in london and the southeast were more likely to do unpaid overtime than those anywhere else london workers were the most likely to need time off because of stress while almost one in two workers in the southeast were more likely to be bad tempered and irritable at work workers in the southwest and yorkshire were among the least stressed most people in wales enjoyed their jobs but more of them complained about work pressures than in any other part of the uk one in three in the northwest complained that work caused a headache while scots were among the least likely to take time off work due to stress related illness and only a minority said they did not like their

bored with lining your bosss pockets want to work for a company you feel is doing some good in the world join the club according to the institute of business ethics ibe support staff are joining the rapidly swelling ranks of uk workers who are turning their backs on employers with no sense of moral responsibility with last weeks news that the government is to drop its ethical foreign policy there are likely to be even more of them taking it into their own hands to ensure that employers lacking values are employers lacking loyal staff says simon webley ibe research director but if the foreign office finds it too difficult to stick to its commitments how easy is it for the support worker to find a truly ethical employer the voluntary sector is perhaps the most obvious port of call and one of the most popular voluntary services overseas vso has just announced a record number of applications an indication that workers are looking for a job that does more than just pay the bills the most common reasons given were the wish to give something back and a need for personal fulfilment explains matthew bell vsos director of communications but bills do need to be paid and the financial rewards in the voluntary sector will barely cover your weekly groceries let alone your rent or mortgage the vsos national recruitment campaign launched earlier this year was upfront about job prospects lawyers wanted salary per annum and yes you did read that correctly even paid posts within charities and indeed the public sector can offer far lower salaries than average thats why says webley its good news that more and more private businesses are introducing a code of business ethics something that shows staff and prospective staff just how seriously they are taking their moral responsibilities a typical code will address corporate policy towards its various stakeholders employees shareholders customers suppliers and the wider public standards relating to suppliers for example are likely to include a commitment to ensuring that there is no child labour at any stage of its supply chain and that wages and working hours are reasonable meanwhile standards relating to staff might include policies on what to do if you are offered products such as stationery that you suspect have been made by exploiting workers in developing countries as part of their code some companies such as campa have set up a trust to send inspectors on regular visits to check the ethical standards and practices of all suppliers whether in east london or the far east other employers including marks amp spencer and monsoon have joined the ethical trading initiative eti a membership body that focuses purely on setting standards for labour within supply chains explains david steele its information officer nevertheless research shows that a few employers do write a code of ethics simply to look good upon closer inspection there may be little real commitment thats why its so important for valuesdriven secretaries to ask at the interview stage not only whether there is a code but whether you can see it advises rachel ormond an academic researcher in ethics and employment it will always exist in document form and increasingly it is included on the company website and in the annual report you might also want to ask whether your prospective employer encourages staff to get involved in giving something back to society she adds employees may do voluntary work for example either wholly or partly in company time and usually on projects initiated by the company allied dunbar sends staff on onemonth secondments to help with projects in india and at mamps hour parttime secondments are set up for staff to help with local community projects which are carried out over threemonth periods so important are employers ethics becoming to todays jobseeker that research shows that they are often the deciding factor when a candidate opts for a particular post in reality pay and training tend to be a higher priority for support staff says a spokesperson for recruitment consultancy manpower but because its a jobseekers market at the moment they can often take those two for granted the etis david steele claims that media coverage has encouraged workers to take a broader interest in the companies for which they work there has been a recent influx of documentaries and features highlighting conditions in factories overseas as well as on issues like child labour in this country he says the fact that the internet has created a global economy is also significant we no longer think of a sweatshop in korea as being so far away a spokesperson for recruitment agency adecco adds a further reason jobseekers have a greater choice in selecting companies they respect and share common values with more employers are going ethical every day the result is that if youre a secretary who wants to work in say the city you can now pick a company that you know invests in environmental projects robert weston founder of groundswell an ethical business consultancy explains organisations approach us not only asking how do we become more values driven but how can we be seen to be valuesdriven the second question comes from employers knowledge that to sell their product and to attract the best recruits they have got to have clearcut values shell is one company that has had to work particularly hard at reassessing its approach following past controversies concerning the disposal of the brent spar oil platform and the companys activities in nigeria last year the company unveiled a new ethical advertising campaign in part aimed at improving its image among prospective employees we want to be seen as a company willing to confront these often difficult issues

almost a quarter of the british workforce is now forced to work at some point between pm and am the price being paid for an american inspired society open hours a day seven days a week is turning out for millions to be antisocial working hours at little or no extra pay fifteen per cent are working all night the number of workers on duty during the hours of darkness will be confirmed in a report this week highlighting the potential dangers to children of being passed like batons in a relay race between shiftworking parents sixtyone percent of working families now have parents away from home during early mornings evenings nights and weekends per cent have a parent who works at weekends the numbers are expected to double by its clear that employers are expecting staff to work whatever hours are needed without seeing these as exceptional circumstances said megan pacey of the daycare trust which will publish shift parents this week there has also been an erosion of premium payments for working outside the old ninetofive hours so people often receive no extra money for this either staff are now required to work antisocial hours in a swath of industries far beyond the traditional fields of restaurants and hotels the decline in hour working expected with the contraction of manufacturing industry has been replaced instead by an explosion in the number of call centres shops and newtechnology businesses operating around the clock tom ingham from dorking in surrey who works as an information processor for an accounting firm said im now required to work one week in four through the night we receive extra pay for doing it but its highly disruptive to family life my partner is tied down every evening with the kids and i feel shattered its difficult enough sleeping in the day anyway but i am almost always disturbed as well by the children in the house i also end up drinking a huge amount of coffee which keeps me on edge for hours he added working these shifts is virtually nonnegotiable everyone in our department has to do it you simply wouldnt expect to get promoted or pay reviewed if you didnt the biggest increase in late working in the past five years has come from the retail sector thirtysix stores in the strong sainsburys chain already open all night on at least one evening a week in december the number will be increased to staff are paid a premium for working on sundays or if their shift covers the hours between midnight and am however they receive no extra pay if obliged to work until midnight or to start in the early hours we are now a hour business even if a store is not actually open said a spokeswoman for the chain there is rarely a time when there isnt a skeleton staff on duty at the very least professor sue yeandle of sheffield hallam university a leading labourmarket expert said the clear trend towards people working into the evening and overnight will continue its certainly true that with a small number of exceptions people are not getting paid a premium even without overnight working the development of the entire service sector in late afternoons and into the evening is very disruptive to family life people in these sectors on relatively modest incomes are simply not able to buy proper childcare to cover these hours on their pay there are clear risks to children but middleclass families are suffering from long hours syndrome too judy mella a surgical registrar in dorset is a single mother with four children she is expected to be on call usually on site at least one night a week its part of the job it means i have to have someone to come in and spend the night at home it has meant employing an au pair who absorbs a third of my takehome pay bensummerskillobservercouk how parents can help ages do use junk mail to

fathers will be allowed to take two weeks of paid paternity leave under radical plans to give parents more time to care for their children the idea is favoured by a group of ministers examining ways of improving parental leave without antagonising business leaders stephen byers trade and industry secretary yesterday called on employers to recognise the importance of child caring many parents were trying to juggle the responsibility of being a good parent with holding down a job he said as he launched a consultation on changes to parental leave the government is to publish a green paper this year outlining changes to entitlements giving fathers two weeks paid leave after the birth of their child is expected to among the main proposals at present they are entitled to weeks unpaid leave if they have children up to age five under the new proposal the leave would have to be taken immediately after the birth to allow companies to plan for an employees absence one ministerial source said the aim was to balance the demands of campaigners who want fathers to be allowed to choose when to take their leave with the needs of employers who are wary of improving parental leave a lot of people work shifts and their absence has to be covered by someone else the source said the people who are calling for a more flexible system come from the world of researchers and academics who are a minority ministers are likely to struggle to win the support of business for the proposal this week the confederation of british industry called on the government to resist demands for paid parental

sacked or forced to resign an eoc spokeswoman said yesterday we would be very disappointed if this does not go ahead almost half of the british workforce is now female of about million people in

workaholic habits are damaging productivity and playing havoc with families attempts to improve their worklife balance the government warned yesterday in the first official report on the social consequences of excessive overtime one in nine fulltime employees works more than hours every week mostly men with children and one in eight regularly works both saturdays and sundays the survey found most men wanted more flexible arrangements such as jobsharing and a reduced working week but twothirds thought working part time would damage their careers most women said they would rather work more flexibly after the birth of a child than have longer maternity leave but almost half the employers thought this would be regarded as unfair by the rest of their staff the government billed the survey as the first and largest research into worklife balance in britain it was based on interviews with employees employers and company head offices margaret hodge the equal opportunities minister said the problem facing industry was not absenteeism but presenteeism the long hours culture is alive and kicking we are all working too long hours and it is making us ill that doesnt help productivity and it certainly doesnt support families mrs hodge was disappointed that overtime had increased since when the government introduced the eu working time directive stopping most firms from making staff work more than hours a week we need to ask why introduction of the hour week has not led to greater change in hours of work and presenteeism but the government was encouraged that of employers in the survey agreed it could be acceptable in some circumstances for staff to switch to part time working the survey found of men who lived as a couple with dependent children worked more than hours a week this compared with of women in the same family circumstances of single parents and of people who were single or members of childless couples the long hours of many males in couple households with children may reflect both a need for income associated with children and the opportunity to work long hours associated with the presence of a partner the report said almost half the employers offered stress counselling but only gave assistance with childcare it feels as if we are dealing with the consequences and not the cause of people not getting the right balance between work and the rest of their lives mrs hodge said but the good news was that of employers let staff vary their hours of employees work flexitime and have arranged to work only during term time john monks general secretary of the tuc said bad employers would not be forced to cut long hours until there were changes in the law the one thing the government could do is announce its intention not to renew the individual opt out to the working time directive which sees many people work excessively long hours john edmonds general secretary of the gmb union said it is right that we should hold a carrot out to the thousands of good employers but it is time that the government showed a willingness to wave a stick at the bad ones peter elwood chief executive of lloyds tsb and chairman of employers for worklife balance said we recognise that men need to balance their work and life outside work just as much as women mrs hodge who admitted working incredibly long hours said men had been excluded from previous campaigns for a better worklife balance now fathers too are calling for a better deal with of fathers working over hours every week it means that men are less and less able to spend the time with the family that

problem facing industry was not absenteeism but presenteeism the long hours culture is alive and kicking we are all working too long hours and it is making us ill that doesnt help productivity and it certainly doesnt support families mrs hodge was disappointed that overtime had increased since when the government introduced the eu working time directive stopping most firms from making staff work more than hours a week we need to ask why introduction of the hour week has not led to greater change in hours of work and presenteeism but the government was encouraged that of employers in the survey agreed it could be acceptable in some circumstances for staff to switch to part time working the survey found of men who lived as a couple with dependent children worked more than hours a week this compared with of women in the same family circumstances of single parents and of people who were single or members of childless couples the long hours of many males in couple households with children may reflect both a need for income associated with children and the opportunity to work long hours associated with the presence of a partner the report said almost half the employers offered stress counselling but only gave assistance with childcare it feels as if we are dealing with the consequences and not the cause of people not getting the right balance between work and the rest of their lives mrs hodge said but the good news was that of employers let staff vary their hours of employees work flexitime and have arranged to work only during term time john monks general secretary of the tuc said bad employers would not be forced to cut long hours until there were changes in the law the one thing the government could do is announce its intention not to renew the individual opt out to the working time directive which sees many people work excessively long hours john edmonds general secretary of the gmb union said it is right that we should hold a carrot out to the thousands of good employers but it is time that the government showed a willingness to wave a stick at the bad ones peter elwood chief executive of lloyds tsb and chairman of employers for worklife balance said we recognise that men need to balance their work and life outside work just as much as women mrs hodge who admitted working incredibly long hours said men had been excluded from previous campaigns for a better worklife balance now fathers too are calling for a better deal with of fathers working over hours every week it means that men are less and less able to spend the time with the family that

the problem i have been offered a new job on a two year contract it is in the same field i work in now which i love and ill be earning more a year for less work but i am worried about losing my permanent contract ive tried to persuade my present employers to pay me more but they refuse despite freely admitting they will readvertise my post at the salary i am requesting now so i dont know what to do its all complicated by the fact that i got married this year and my husband and i want a baby within the next couple of years with my present job i have all the stability years of service pension maternity benefits i could want the solution what a dilemma if you had no ties or commitments then it might be easier to pack in a steady job for a better one with a less certain future however your desire to start a family does complicate things a little but dont forget that you will still have some maternity rights in the new job you can take weeks of unpaid statutory maternity leave regardless of length of service once you have worked for your new employer for twentysix weeks ending with the fifteenth week before our due date you can normally claim statutory maternity pay as well for weeks speak to acas number in your phone book for more advice on maternity rights so what you do really depends on what plans you think you might have if and when a baby arrives for example some new mothers are happy to take six weeks off after the birth and go straight back to work others want six months and some want to stay with their child until she starts school more commonly women often decide to go back to work parttime your partners financial situation is also an issue could he support you for a while if the baby arrived at the end of the two year contract and how would you feel about jobhunting towards the end of your contract if you were heavily pregnant the bottom line is that you dont know what the future holds you might get pregnant within the next two years you might not you might find yourself out of work at the end of the two year contract but you might not if you stay put you might get a rise but you might not the only certainties are that you are currently overworked and undervalued but secure and have an opportunity to improve your conditions but at a cost security is the risk of insecurity a greater stress than the overwork you have now

labour sometimes gets it in the neck for the way it puts work uppermost in its social policy single mothers poor people the young who are not in education or training even the disabled all are to be redeemed by finding jobs the government is right emancipation does lie in the workplace earning a living is the principal sometimes the only route out of social exclusion but this focus has made it hard for ministers to get across other messages especially those which urge a better balance of home and job or giving children the large amounts of time and attention they deserve where work is progress who should regret the creation of a culture in which refusal to work excessive hours is regarded by employees themselves as damaging to career prospects or merely soft but what kind of society is it where employers are more likely to offer their staff stress counselling than fork out to help them look after their children new research out yesterday contains more evidence of the extraordinary hold employment has over our lives and perhaps imaginations too despite workingtime directives and a panoply of formal rights and contracts such surveys may it is true accentuate the negative lots of people find work socially rewarding some even play at work but margaret hodge the employment minister is right to focus on the costs of the work culture for children fathers need flexibility if the burden of child care is to be more equally shared the government might say it has done what it can laws to prevent staff from exploitation are in place progress is being made on

once upon a time corporate man cared who had the biggest desk whether he was allocated a parking space and how often the boss asked him for a drink after lengthy office hours now no more what the majority of male employees apparently hanker after is a small corner of home in which they can do their business alone according to the first of a series of studies commissioned by the department for education and employment worklife balance published today a quarter of men already work from home and a further would like to do so among women work from home and a further wish to follow in their footsteps the survey which questioned employees and employers indicates that only of workers prefer being homebased because of childcare most people want to become more effective employees the survey part of the governments attempt to encourage us all to get a life and therefore also save the billions of pounds now being forked out on ill health and absenteeism reaffirms that the british unlike many other europeans cant get enough of work onefifth of employees put in more than hours a week of them fathers oneeighth work both saturday and sunday and almost of employees who work extra hours do so without pay part of the reason for this devotion to duty is that britain is dominated by small and mediumsized businesses more than half of which employ fewer than workers if you work alongside the boss it becomes all that much harder to watch the clock another part of the reason is selfpreservation and job insecurity theres not much point in getting a life if you then have no money with which to enjoy it the worklife debate is also not as the government perhaps inadvertently implies genderblind as peter moss of london university points out it raises yet again the wicked issues the way in which in the workplace time the valuation of care and the importance of production and reproduction have a profoundly different impact on men and women it is telling that far fewer women than men in todays dfee survey wish to work from home why first because as relative newcomers to the workplace their confidence is arguably less a survey published in the summer by management today magazine indicated that of working mothers believe that presenteeism dominates the culture of work families can ruin your career in the same survey of women said there were times when work was a welcome refuge from home compared with only of men why because of course home means something very different to females than it does to their male partners paid work in the home for men may mean precisely that for women it means dealing with children and domesticity as they have always done but even more so because they no longer have the office break one of the ironies of the worklife balance debate of course is that the solution most strongly pushed flexibility can when too narrowly defined add to the burden of women rather than diminish it what it should mean for instance is termtime and parttime work without forfeiting a career or training opportunities what it becomes too often in practice is working long hours for less money if parttime staggered over unsocial times such as nights and weekends and an end to job satisfaction the dfees survey tells us that one in five employees works for companies open hours a day in europe academics such as eviatur zerubavel acknowledge that the time squeeze and the creation of a new worklife balance affect women most acutely and that all parts of society have to contribute to the solutions employers included for instance in holland some companies offer time banks employees accrue time instead of cash bonuses which they can use when they please in britain only of companies offer modest sabbaticals since men now also regularly take time off women are no longer penalised in their careers when for instance they go on maternity leave according to todays survey while almost half of employees are likely to be offered stress counselling to cope with the long hours culture only are offered assistance with basic childcare needs the government is loath to press employers to do more whether on childcare or in creating a different culture yet according to professor shirley dex of cambridge university an end to the longhours culture would cause almost no financial or organisational costs but produce a number of benefits including retention of staff employers of course know the arguments well yet until the government gets tougher and male employees more demanding worklife balance will continue to be viewed as mainly a female employees problem one

this week the rumbustious columnist jeremy clarkson wrote in the sunday times about the bbc on wednesday night i went to a throughly enjoyable dinner hosted by the head of factual documentaries at the bbc who is a woman he starts also in attendance were her two deputies who are women the head of daytime television who is a woman the new controller of bbc who is a woman the woman in charge of regionally made television and ray mears he goes on to list many of the women who hold senior positions in the beeb in his usual blokeish fashion the addition of an acerbic bitter ending to his story is missing however because he concludes that women are just as capable as men at doing these highpowered jobs and good luck to them thanks jezzer yet the bbc with its positive policies towards childcare flexible working and the longterm career prospects of women remains an anomaly in the business world rather than the foretaste of female power clarkson seems to hint at women still face huge levels of sexism in the workplace last week the industrial society urged big businesses to stop living in the past when it reported that just of directors of ftse companies are female most in need of a shakeup is standard chartered bank which has a board of all of whom are male there is plenty of other evidence the new earnings survey just pub lished by the equal opportunities commission shows that at this rate it will be years until the gap between men and womens earnings is closed women who work full time are still earning on average an hour compared with for men in scotland the situation is more acute average hourly wages for women are around less than mens also last month the institute of management released its national management salary survey while it showed that important progress has been made in the number of women managers it is still the case that just can claim the title of manager next look at some of the cases going through the courts this year judy owen won a battle against the professional golfers association earning the right to wear trousers at work a female stationery clerk who had been ostracised by senior managers because she was pregnant won her sexual discrimination case and a former city analyst brought a case against her employers schroder securities claiming that she was being paid less than two male colleagues working in a similar field rebecca miller is a stockbroker in the city she is one of thousands of women breaking into jobs previously reserved for men she agrees that the most noticable instances of sexism within the industry are in the recruitment process itself you definitely have to be more able than a man if you looked at a number of cvs im sure you would find that the women had far better qualifications than the men and the city is still very much an old boy network she says clients are mostly old money and want to be treated as such preferably by someone who went to a school with which they are familiar once in position ms miller says the sexism becomes more subtle in my previous job you could not get above a certain level you had to change firms to get up the ladder although maybe this is the case for men as well i would not say that women are held back but i would say that women have to be more aggressive in the job you can also find that as a woman you are locked out of the office information flow most of the problems stem from the attitudes of men who are not used to working with women who are their equals or seniorsin extreme cases women are subjected to innuendo harrassment and potentially offensive pornographic material which circulates around many workplaces and says ms miller there are instances of positive discrimination this makes for resentment between the men and women in the office because they feel that the females get a fairer deal than them when i got my first job i had long brunette hair when i turned up on the first day i found that all the other women had too i dont want to think that i have been taken on for reasons of positive discrimination half the brokers may think that but im just going to carry on and prove myself the eoc has told the government that women could be the answer to its problem of a shortage of trained soldiers in the army but the services hardly have a good record with female employment even if the army has now introduced what it calls a genderfree physical fitness selection test the commission is calling for a lifting of the ban on women serving in combat regiments which at the moment effectively bans them from one third of the jobs in the army the chairwoman of the eoc julie mellor says many women in the forces have told us they were not happy with the way their complaint of sexual harassment was dealt with and while women are not longer routinely dismissed when they become pregnant attitudes towards women with children remain a problem rather than automatically excluding women from certain posts it makes sense to judge each on the basis of their ability to carry out the job we believe that special measures such as training initiatives to equip women to work in certain jobs which have traditionally been done by men would help boost the number of women applying she says but she admits it is not easy to change attitudes if those women are to be retained the culture within the services still needs to

public sector employers have an enviable reputation for providing equality of opportunity for women but the private sector is catching up the national management salary survey by the institute of management and consultancy remuneration economics shows that of women are at director level in the private sector compared with in the public sector and a groundbreaking study of women chief executives in local government sponsored by pricewaterhousecoopers has shown that female public sector managers feel as vulnerable and isolated as they did years ago according to the research women still feel judged by their physical appearance rather than their ability and it seems that what a senior woman wears is as important as what she does at work pam fox joint author of the study with mike broussine and a visiting research fellow at the university of west of england tells of an aspiring chief executive who overheard a member of a selection panel say you can tell shes hard by the shape of her lips she adds that men and women perceive senior women as lacking charisma and presence especially if they are physically small or younglooking thats not all the equal pay act has been in force for years in december but womens pay in the public sector still falls well short of equality the latest figures drawn from shows public sector women still earning only of the salary of their male colleagues only teachers with a strong national pay structure and an industryspecific review board come anywhere close to parity at across local government from social services to environmental health and from waste disposal to clerical work traditional divisions of labour persist along gender lines women are overrepresented in professions that rarely make it to the top such as social care and human resources and while a growing number of women are entering public accountancy and law common backgrounds for public sector chief executives relatively few make it to the top of their professional tree but the foxbroussine research also found that women are making up their own rules for career advancement and that can only be good news for men and women alike no longer forced down a traditional path of unbroken career advancement many new women at the top have moved from one employment sector to another gaining valuable experience as they go wider perspective one example is stella manzie chief example of the newly formed unitary local authority in west berkshire a cambridge graduate with a degree in english manzie has worked for the nowdefunct association of county councils and also as private sector management consultant the fact that i dont come from a particular professional background has given me a wider perspective she says my private sector experience taught me to deliver work to a tight timescale and on budget and has given me credibility so how can senior and aspiring women make that allimportant career move rita sammons a former president of the society of chief personnel officers in local government suggests that women take time out to develop themselves and their career get involved in national projects highprofile partnerships and network she says if you raise your profile people will remember you there are still so few senior women around sammons suggests that women should aim high the next step is probably easier than you think if it isnt decide what support you need to get there public sector headhunters agree with her and advise women to be more demanding when they look for career advancement maurice smart from local government headhunters tmp worldwide says that too few women ask for the help theyre entitled to if you apply for a job through a professional recruitment consultancy make sure you get measured feedback both on your application and your interview performance he says women often understate their achievements on their cv and dont include enough hard facts smart suggests that women need to make sure their cv works hard for them dont be shy about telling a future employer about budgets youve managed productivity gains youve achieved or changes youve made he says ask for advice on how to tailor your

it is time we started talking up residential childcare the evidence is that working in childrens homes requires some of the highest skills and personal qualities in social care most children who need support remain with their own families or in foster care and the numbers in residential care have greatly reduced the result of this good policy is that young people in childrens homes have usually had very damaging experiences and may have had their difficulties compounded by failures in other parts of the care system the media and the public need very little information to understand that the work is hard and demanding but this is rarely offered why is residential care so stigmatised it is undeniable that some workers betrayed those they were entrusted to care for and that it took young people rather than professionals in the main to reveal the appalling abuse nothing can put right the fact that some of those young people paid with their lives and others with a lifetime of lost opportunities but a bad press for residential childcare has persisted for years in spite of evidence including evidence from young people and their families that good residential care can be liberating and can keep family relationships healthy behind the bad image is a belief often held by others in social care that only familybased care is good for children and this may be combined with a suspicion that anyone wanting to nurture other peoples children outside a family is at least odd and at worst a potential abuser finally there is the apparently high cost of residential care apparently because other parts of the care system are not fully costed and the longer term costs of poor care in terms of careers in crime poor physical and mental health and low educational achievement are not taken into account familybased care is what the vast majority of children need but a whole range of support is necessary to tailor support to specific needs residential childcare is a small but significant resource when used well it can prevent the breakdown of family relationships and offer some young people an option they prefer we are reaching the point when staff doing the most skilful job in social care are being undermined by public criticism and pinned down by rigid procedures the very relationships between staff and young people that create the possibility for the young person to flourish are increasingly hard to maintain because of the ways staff have to operate to survive expert practitioners tend to leave when they cannot do the job well the risk is that we will replace them with staff who can do no more than hold on to young people for long enough for them to fend for themselves as young adults if this happens it will confirm them on a path toward social exclusion there are hopeful signs examples of high quality residential childcare do exist they focus on outcomes a respect for human rights and the young peoples values they have a commitment

oliver smyth is chortling gently as he plays with his lego on the floor blue eyes wide open he grasps a farmyard fence and rushes to give it to his mother one of the family cats slips in and he scampers after it caught up in the joy of being two years old the smyths home is testament to a much longed for child from the numerous photos and jumbled toys to the letter fridge magnets spelling his name yet when he arrived his mother rosie a yearold nursing assistant for an nhs community trust in the west country was granted just days maternity leave in contrast to the weeks given to most new mothers the reason is that oliver is adopted and at present adoptive parents have no statutory right to paid maternity leave it is an issue which the government last week announced it will address after a threemonth consultation on the green paper on work and parents the trade and industry secretary stephen byers admitted that he had been unaware of the discrepancy and signalled his determination to change this rosie and her husband nigel who are waiting to adopt again do not want her to return to work again after six weeks as she was forced to through financial necessity and so in the first case of its kind they have successfully used the human rights act to claim that their child was being discriminated against and force her employer to offer adoptive parents the same maternity leave as birth parents sense of injustice rosies realisation that her employers an nhs community health trust would treat her differently to birth mothers came when she approached them after hearing that she could adopt oliver as a fourmonthold in the spring of the issue of maternity leave had not occurred to her before she had been too preoccupied with three failed ivf attempts she was surprised by the response i was told there was a draft policy agreement that gave six weeks on half pay but that since the board had not approved it it was up to individual managers to choose whether to implement it her managers did not implement the draft policy but offered days special leave for family reasons an appeal to a second manager who had adopted a child brought a further six days but the offer fell a long way short of the eight weeks on full pay and weeks on half pay offered to birth mothers with olivers arrival imminent rosie and nigel felt they were in no position to fight rosie borrowed money and enjoyed a mere six weeks with her baby before she was forced to return to work parttime she said my bosses offered me more unpaid leave they werent going to force me back before i was ready but money was leaving oliver was she admitted very hard it wasnt fair and i thought it was particularly unfair on him i thought the trust was discriminating against him as a baby he was denied the chance to have a fulltime mum for the same amount of time as any other baby she said the sense of injustice continued to rankle and it did not help when a colleague became pregnant all the time i was aware that she and her baby would have weeks together while my baby and i just had three weeks she said with the realisation that she would want to adopt again she began months of campaigning writing to politicians and her union unison she argued that maternity leave was important to allow her to bond with her baby sympathy was offered but the message was the same maternity leave in the words of the department of social security was offered to protect women from the exertions of work immediately prior to giving birth and to allow a period of rest immediately following the exertion of childbirth and then she had a breakthrough on the advice of a judge she contacted a family lawyer who told her that her employer as a public authority forced to adhere to the european convention on human rights may have breached article of the human rights act deprived of mothers time the article is quite broad and bans discrimination on grounds not only of sex race and social origin but birth explained chris hall of crosse amp crosse solicitors oliver as an adopted child appeared to have been discriminated against because he was being deprived of time with his mother that a child with a birth mother would have had a human rights barrister at matrix backed up this view arguing that it was given force because article of the act covering the right to family life also appeared to have been flouted faced with being sued under the human rights act the trust changed its mind and offered six weeks paid leave at ninetenths of her salary followed by weeks on half pay plus the equivalent of statutory pay the policy may not have been quite equal to that for birth mothers and oliver may not have had his mother at home for weeks but at least it would apply to their next adopted child the chief executive of british agencies for adoption and fostering felicity collier said this is an issue that we are concerned about as it restricts the number of people coming forward to adopt the success of adoption will depend on how successful those first few months are when a child joins your family it is vitally important there is time for at least one parent to be at

even if the options for making life easier for working parents contained in the governments recent green paper were all taken up parents in the united kingdom would still receive less help and protection at work than those in almost every other country in europe when it comes to maternity rights parental leave and pay while taking time off to look after children this country is and will remain a long way behind its neighbours the trade secretary stephen byers is proposing modest changes to existing rights things like extending the right to unpaid maternity leave to a year or increasing the flat rate of statutory maternity pay now per week there are also limited rights to work reduced hours for either or both parents after having a child these are balanced by ideas to help make the law and the administration of maternity pay simpler for employers and the possibility of exemptions for some small businesses but labour has made quite clear that not all of the proposals will be implemented employers employees and other interested groups are invited to indicate their top three priorities on a list they have until march to respond to put the proposals in perspective sweden offers days of paid leave per family which can be taken all at once or used to reduce working hours norway offers weeks of fulltime leave paid at of earnings germany france and spain offer fulltime leave for new parents until their child is three years old which in the first two countries can also be used to work parttime belgium has three months fulltime or six months parttime leave backed by a careerbreaks scheme of up to six years the uk was the last country in the european union to introduce parental leave years after a draft ec directive was first proposed and years after sweden even the us was quicker with the family and medical leave act in only five other eu members offer no form of payment for people taking family leave all of them offer earningsrelated maternity pay for longer than the six weeks given in the uk most of them also have wellestablished rights for men and women to work reduced or flexible hours after having a baby this has been fiercely resisted here so far by employers the proposal that got the most media attention was that men should be offered the right to two weeks paternity leave possibly paid at the per week rate the recognition that caring for children is not just the mothers responsibility and that men might need financial help from the government to be able to take a bigger caring role is significant certainly all the evidence from elsewhere in europe is that entitlements to leave are not taken by men in any numbers unless it is paid and paid at a high enough rate to replace earnings from work the big question is why the state should get involved coming from the department of trade and industry the green paper focused mainly on productivity and the business case for changing the law parents especially women need help to balance work and family care because otherwise they and their skills will be lost to employers and the economy either because they have to give up work or because they work less efficiently refreshingly the green paper does offer as one of its goals safeguarding the health and welfare of the mother and child before and after birth the wellbeing of children or elderly dependants of working people often gets lost in todays debate over worklife balance and familyfriendly employment burdens on business usually get more attention the state will get involved because having a child is more than a lifestyle choice it is something special that deserves help and support from employers and the rest of society but should businesses carry the costs of losing staff should childless workers work harder to cover for them many people probably think that the answer to both questions is no over to government if its job is to improve the welfare of all its citizens through time then even where a new regulation might not be in the interests of particular businesses it is still the right thing to do the choice over exactly how much public help should be offered parents is a political one resting on a belief that parents interests should be given priority with a claim on taxpayers the ways in which other european countries provide rights and financial help to families and working parents vary enormously differences do not just come from detailed calculations of cost or labour market structures they reflect different cultural attitudes to the family to the roles of men and women to childcare and to how far the state should be involved france has a long history of trying to encourage more childbirth so it pays benefits only for second and subsequent children germany has traditionally aimed to support the malebreadwinner family and so made it easier for women not to work the scandinavian countries have had a longlasting commitment to sex equality and helping both parents to work finland is proposing to raise its paid paternity leave from to days within a week of a british proposal to raise it from nothing to two weeks this is not because the finns can afford it more than the british it is a priority for them so they choose collectively to spend their money that way nick burkitt researches the future of work at the institute for public policy

like any aphorism the bumper stickers declaring if we had known about grandchildren we would have had them first has a ring of truth everyone has heard about the satisfaction of grandparenting a second chance of parenting within sharply defined time periods yet a survey marking the launching of our monthly grandparents page in g today suggests almost a quarter feel they are being exploited as a source of childcare ironically men who do much less of the caring feel more exploited than do women this is in line with earlier surveys sadly one last month suggested that of grandparents breathe a sigh of relief when their grandchildren are taken off their hands like earlier surveys todays shows that a massive amount of childcare is being provided by grandparents it estimates that more than a third are spending the equivalent of three days a week caring for grandchildren an earlier study estimated that m grandparents were spending more than hours a week babysitting but how long will this provision continue there are several reasons why it could shrink first because of the dissatisfaction grandparents express about regular childminding duties about already refuse to act as childminders second because of the growing number of women in the workforce the average age of becoming a grandparent is still about this will be pushed back if the trend continues towards women having their first baby at a later age but retirement age will also be pushed back we already live in the oldest society that has existed but it is going to get older still fewer births and longer lives mean the number

halffull or halfempty the governments green paper on working parents was greeted with some confusion by campaigners it is one of the most flexible green papers ever written full of possibility but no certainty everything says the department of trade and industry is out for consultation so this rubber document can be bounced either way who shouts loudest wins parents or the cbi next thursday outside the dti there will be a baby blockade with small children and big plastic toys and tractors to mimic the fuel protesters under the banner does the government only listen to those with trucks the demo is demanding better maternity pay paid parental leave and the right to work flexible or parttime hours yesterdays green paper launch was a skilled operation briefers were out in force telling one story to employers and another to the parentalrights campaigners stephen byers started out dismally at the dti remember his wealth creation matters more than wealth redistribution and his attempt to sabotage parttime workers rights he has come a long way since then but he is still trying to appease both sides last april he was briefing that there would definitely be a right to paid parental leave weeks spread over five years since then the cbis digby jones has bullied and browbeaten with such success that no paid parental leave appears in this green paper we were strongly against it says the cbi on the other hand the women in government fought hard too and there are options in this green paper that could profoundly improve life for parents before the manifesto is written byers will have to declare which side he is on women mps and ministers were busy sending out the message yesterday push him hard since the cbi is now the governments political enemy anyway having played strong cards with considerable stupidity byers might as well find favour with the women instead one campaigning backbencher emerged from a dti briefing saying brilliant others were more circumspect britains maternity and paternity rights are the worst in the eu and byers agrees the status quo is not an option mothers trying to return to work after having a baby have been treated cruelly until now no childcare and low maternity pay for only weeks the wonder is that so many do manage to get back to work research by harriet harman for the clothing union kfat found women working in factories forced to return to work within weeks describing an almost unbearable wrench nationally of mothers go back to work well before their weeks is over because they cant afford not to under the familyfriendly tories maternity pay fell from of average earnings to forcing poorer mothers back to work ever sooner now labour will probably promise that the a week maternity pay will rise to and possibly more for the full weeks mothers who can afford it can take a full year off while fathers get two weeks paid paternity leave a good gesture long overdue but one remarkable proposal could profoundly change the working habits of the entire nation all mothers and fathers could get the right to reduced working hours for as long as they wish it would be the first genuine attempt to reform britains longhours culture after the shameful way the government weaselled out of the eu directive imposing a hour maximum week here is a chance to turn labours familyfriendly talk into action but it may not happen the cbi yesterday expressed shock at finding the right to parttime working proposed at all it would be most damaging it is a sticking point for us they said indignant that for once they were not forewarned they will fight it all the way demanding reasoned encouragement to employers instead of a legal obligation however dti research found flexible hours was what parents wanted most this could start a revolution if campaigners push to see that paid parental leave is reinstated too with a right to spread it out across one day a week suddenly the fourday week looks possible and eventually universal why not with more wealth in the next decade why not work less will byers stand firm he has also proposed a loophole that would effectively nullify the right to flexible work small businesses may be exempt that means exempting a third of the workforce including those who most need the right many bigger employers already offer flexibility labour has gone to extraordinary lengths to mollify small employers as if they were a national treasure when the opposite is often the case small businesses are already exempt from many workers rights when the minimum wage was first mooted it was small employers who claimed thousands of jobs would be lost meanwhile large employers briefed sotto voce that if some small businesses went to the wall because they couldnt afford to pay a living wage it would be no bad thing those running small nursing homes or marginal catering and cleaning outfits often offer bad services undercutting better professional companies that give employees decent conditions some economists suggest britains low productivity about which gordon brown fulminates frequently may be partly connected with the uk having too many small companies a quarter of all eu firms employing under people are in the uk as larger companies point out sardonically few small companies choose to be small yet there is a strange treasury sentimentality about them offering special tax breaks and assistance why should they get a dispensation to mistreat their workforce with exemptions from reasonable employment laws should small chimneysweeping companies still be allowed to send boys up chimneys labours manifesto could trounce the tories by offering a revolution for young families it would expose tory family talk for the cant it is one popular move would be harmans idea of a special tax credit for underthrees allowing mothers to stay at home or use it for childcare if they go back to work what about a pledge for stateoftheart nurseries in every neighbourhood for all could the tories refuse to endorse these yet every time they match labour spending as on health and education their tax cuts become more incredible the tories will mistakenly take the employers side on

tony blair has given the goahead for a neardoubling of statutory maternity pay in the most radical changes to parental rights since the second world war mothers will be offered a week to stay at home with their newborn babies a huge increase on the current a week the move which would cost the state an estimated m extra a week is designed to slash the number of new mothers who return to work early because they are unable to survive on the current figure more than half of new mothers return before the weeks of paid leave to which they are entitled with citing money as the reason the plan widely welcomed by family groups is among proposals in the governments green paper on work and parents published yesterday it seeks to bring britains provision for working parents into line with scandinavian and other eu states the consultation document suggests that working mothers should have the right to stay at home for a year after their childs birth with paid maternity leave extended from to weeks unpaid breaks could last up to months instead of the present weeks and fathers could be given two weeks paternity leave paid at the same rate as mothers both parents could have the option of sharing unpaid maternity leave in a surprise move calculated to woo women voters mothers could also have the right to work reduced hours for up to a year after their childs birth the flexible working could continue when maternity leave ends although small businesses could be exempt large businesses could also be let off if they can prove that their business would be unduly disrupted the reduced hours plan which the womens ministers tessa jowell and baroness jay and the employment minister margaret hodge had pressed hard for during a ministerial review process had been widely expected to be dropped in the face of opposition from big business but ministers believe it is the key to retaining the third of women who do not return to work after giving birth at a cost to employers of a worker or m a year to the economy i think this is the most important issue ms hodge said we need to find a way of reconciling the business interests with the interests of a lot of mothers and what a lot of women want is more flexible working hours nearly half of all working women have children under five with the figure likely to be by launching the paper the trade and industry secretary stephen byers said the review group had been surprised to learn that adoptive parents had no maternity rights they would be able to take paid leave in line with birth parents he said he described the worklife balance as one of the key issues facing us in a modern society and insisted that the system had to change the labour market has changed dramatically over the last years and the status quo is not an option we need to give support and assistance to parents but in a way that business will recognise as important he said the employment services would be encouraged to train more temporary replacements for small businesses while cash advances would be offered to cover employers maternity pay theres an opportunity where we can marry both being a good parent and a good employee the proposals out for consultation until march were widely welcomed the maternity alliance praised the governments determination to move things forward the equal opportunity commission said it showed a commitment to

the mother six months of paid maternity leave was definitely definitely a great idea said stephanie prestonhargrave her sole complaint was that the green paper came too late to help her with katie three and emma nine months ive joked that i should get pregnant again so i could benefit from the new packages and have a stressfree time ms prestonhargrave said six months would have made quite a difference a years unpaid leave could be good if you were in a financial situation to take advantage of it i went back to work parttime when katie was weeks old and i didnt like that i felt she was very young with my next firm i should have gone back to work when emma was or weeks old they clearly werent family friendly instead she left the company and now works parttime in an office near her home in manchester she was pleased that the proposals included paternity leave the help of her husband chris hargrave had been essential after the births of their children but she was worried that the green paper might deter oldfashioned employers from hiring women the employer for brian lewis the thought of losing workers for weeks at a time appals him he heads a staff of at britone nail lacquer in st helens merseyside struggling to keep down production costs to avoid losing customers to overseas manufacturers if someone took two weeks paternity leave it would put us in a serious position he said why should i underwrite any individuals lifestyle when my four children were born i took holiday time theres going to be a backlash from people with out kids who want time off its all going to multiply but he believed few of his workers would take advantage of the extra leave i dont believe any male would jeopardise a weeks work for not one of the women who work here and has children has had weeks off on maternity leave they cant afford it the only effect would be to create more red tape were getting closer to the nanny state were tied up looking at legislation when i should be out there getting work for these people in the end it will affect employment the father richard edmonstone found one big difference between the births of his two daughters paternity leave when kirsten now twoandahalf was born his employer at the time said he would have to use his holiday entitlement for time off but when erin now weeks old arrived his new firm offered him a weeks paid leave the difference five days can make is incredible said mr edmonstone of edinburgh a software development manager with my previous company i had to take five days holiday and i felt it put extra strain on the birth you dont have time for a real break because youre dealing with all the hassle of the birth and recovery in a way my new employer has preempted the government with erin they gave me five days of paid leave and i took a weeks holiday my wife clare and i had a real break it also means that if shes ill i can take some holiday time off to help out such policies were in the interests of companies as well as employees when a firm treats you well at times like that it creates a certain loyalty youre much more willing to work overtime to get jobs done the green paper in

stephen byers the modernising trade and industry secretary who relishes his reputation as one of new labours most enthusiastic cheerleaders is an unlikely radical within weeks of taking up his cabinet post mr byers issued the provocative declaration that wealth creation was more important than wealth redistribution hardly the sentiments of a reformer however his green paper on parental rights published yesterday does have a radical edge which would usher in the most significant changes since the second world war in this contentious area the prospect of a near doubling in statutory maternity pay and an extension of unpaid maternity leave to allow a woman to stay at home for a year would go a long way towards taking britain closer to more generous arrangements in europe at the launch of his green paper yesterday mr byers demonstrated his new found credentials as a radical when he declared that britain was way off pace on parental rights the status quo is not an option he said mr byers is not however about to abandon his role as a modernising blairite the wideranging recommendations in the green paper are balanced with concessions to business in the hope of persuading organisations such as the cbi to drop their opposition to reform showing their devotion to the blairite third way mr byers and the womens minister baroness jay spoke of their relish for the challenge of winning over business leaders the two ministers who launched their green paper at a small london business happy computers are embarking on a twopronged offensive to sweet talk business in the first place carrots are to be offered to persuade business leaders that they will not be overburdened with red tape a generous compensation package will help businesses cope with the costs of administering new schemes businesses are also to be offered an advance on maternity payments to ensure cash flow is not jeopardised the second element of the ministerial charm offensive is to persuade businesses that improving parental rights is in their interests improved rights will they say lead to more effective and more loyal employees mr byers detailed his thinking when he spoke of a new opportunity to marry together the goal of being a good parent with being a good employee in the classic language of blairism he added we should not see them as being in conflict his soothing language appeared to fall on deaf ears when the cbi and the british chambers of commerce voiced strong misgivings about the reforms the bcc complained of the cumulative burden imposed on them by the government however one minister who has been closely involved in the review compared the negotiations to the battle over the minimum wage we are at the same stage with business on parental rights that we were with the minimum wage five years ago the minister said business was very hostile to the minimum wage then but no one is opposed now some critics will argue that ministers have gone too far in appeasing business leaders severe restrictions have been placed on the right to parttime work this has been renamed reduced hours and employers are to be given a veto if they can prove that their business would be damaged by an employee moving away from fulltime work despite misgivings voiced by the equal opportunities commission the governments reforms will ensure that labour stands on a significantly more radical platform at the next general election labour was famously pilloried for its manifesto which adopted a safety first approach across a whole range of issues but one minister said the reforms to parental rights which will be a key element of labours manifesto will show that new labour now has the courage to be more ambitious we had to be cautious in the run up to the last election because we had to persuade people we were competent the minister said we have now achieved that which means we can now be more ambitious and set out a real agenda for the second term our parental reforms give us

tony blair has given the goahead for a neardoubling of statutory maternity pay in the most radical changes to parental rights since the second world war mothers will be offered a week to stay at home with their newborn babies a huge increase on the current a week the move which would cost the state an estimated m extra a week is designed to slash the number of new mothers who return to work early because they are unable to survive on the current figure more than half of new mothers return before the weeks of paid leave to which they are entitled with citing money as the reason the plan widely welcomed by family groups is among proposals in the governments green paper on work and parents published yesterday it seeks to bring britains provision for working parents into line with scandinavian and other eu states the consultation document suggests that working mothers should have the right to stay at home for a year after their childs birth with paid maternity leave extended from to weeks unpaid breaks could last up to months instead of the present weeks and fathers could be given two weeks paternity leave paid at the same rate as mothers both parents could have the option of sharing unpaid maternity leave in a surprise move calculated to woo women voters mothers could also have the right to work reduced hours for up to a year after their childs birth the flexible working could continue when maternity leave ends although small businesses could be exempt large businesses could also be let off if they can prove that their business would be unduly disrupted the reduced hours plan which the womens ministers tessa jowell and baroness jay and the employment minister margaret hodge had pressed hard for during a ministerial review process had been widely expected to be dropped in the face of opposition from big business but ministers believe it is the key to retaining the third of women who do not return to work after giving birth at a cost to employers of a worker or m a year to the economy i think this is the most important issue ms hodge said we need to find a way of reconciling the business interests with the interests of a lot of mothers and what a lot of women want is more flexible working hours nearly half of all working women have children under five with the figure likely to be by launching the paper the trade and industry secretary stephen byers said the review group had been surprised to learn that adoptive parents had no maternity rights they would be able to take paid leave in line with birth parents he said he described the worklife balance as one of the key issues facing us in a modern society and insisted that the system had to change the labour market has changed dramatically over the last years and the status quo is not an option we need to give support and assistance to parents but in a way that business will recognise as important he said the employment services would be encouraged to train more temporary replacements for small businesses while cash advances would be offered to cover employers maternity pay theres an opportunity where we can marry both being a good parent and a good employee the proposals out for consultation until march were widely welcomed the maternity alliance praised the governments determination to move things forward the equal opportunity commission said it showed a commitment to

flexible approach geoff meall is a booking agent for bands which include super furry animals the last poets and barenaked ladies and lives in north london his sons luca and charlie are three and two years old when we had our first child he had to have an operation when he was just seven days old he came home in the morning and had to be rushed to hospital the same night my second son born months later was six weeks premature and my partner was in hospital for days after the birth so i was looking after the oldest while visiting my partner in hospital for nearly three weeks i was in an unusual position at work in that we are not selfemployed but my boss is very flexible about the time we can take off i took off quite a bit of time when the two boys were born and my boss just gave me the nod that i could take it as paternity leave the proposed paternity leave wouldnt actually have made any difference to me as we do our own hours and there is no rigid culture as long as i bring in the commissions i can work the hours i like having said that i do spend a lot of time going to see the bands when they are on tour as i am their representative for their live career the more time you take off the more work you have to do when you eventually get back to work generous allowance anselm gurney is a recreation manager at mid suffolk leisure centre his daughter martha is three months old i would have liked the extra time off that has been proposed i got five days paternity leave under the local authority guidelines and the time off was paid the same as a holiday would have been i also took two weeks off as holiday one week at a time in the first month after martha had been born in additional to the paternity leave the time off that the local authority allows is quite generous compared with the private sector where some companies dont allow paternity leave at all from an employers point of view it might become more difficult if the paternity leave meant that you were losing a key member of staff for a longer period of time on balance though i think it is probably better that the father gets the extra time off with his child it seems unfair to assume that the father should have to be at work on the day the baby is born or very soon afterwards i can see however that the extra leave might have a greater impact on a smaller company where the loss of a manager or key member of staff for two or three weeks would have a more significant effect if you wanted to be much more radical one way to make leave more equal would be to allow the mother to go back to work early while the father continued with the equivalent of maternity leave this might make sense for couples where the father has decided that long term he is going to give up his job but his partner is going to go back to work that type of role reversal would be fairer to both men and women interviews by marianne curphey,2000-12,flexible approach geoff meall booking agent band include super furry animal

the trade and industry secretary stephen byers will accuse the cbi and other business organisations of being outdated and out of touch with enlightened company practice on the rights of employed parents this week a long awaited green paper on the balance between work and home life to be published on thursday will claim that improved rights could save business at least m a year in reduced recruitment costs in the long term the government will propose two weeks statepaid paternity leave for working fathers each year the dti estimates that there would be a take up which will cost the state m a year it recommends the rate should be set at the same as the flat rate for maternity pay it will also propose that parents with disabled children should be allowed to take extended parental leave at any point up to the childs th birthday at present access to parental leave stops as soon as a child is five the dti will also propose a range of extended maternity rights but offer no fixed proposals mr byers is to take on both the british chambers of commerce and the cbi by ridiculing their claim that his proposals will be a burden on business he will draw on a dti survey showing massive support for the reforms to press his case the industry secretary likens the coming battle to the struggle to persuade business to accept the statutory minimum wage and will argue that the ideas in the green paper mark a key dividing line between labour and the tories as the election approaches the green paper will argue that if as a result of its proposals only of mothers change their mind and return to work following the birth of their child employers would save m in recruitment costs the average cost of recruiting each individual worker is estimated at for example the nhs loses an investment of if a doctor leaves and if a nurse quits the profession mr byers also hopes to draw the sting of cbi resistance by pointing out that businesses that employ fewer than ten people are likely to have a pregnant member of staff only once every years any company with workforce of less than staff is likely to have a pregnant worker once every five years drawing on unpublished dti data mr byers will cite polls showing that of parents think fathers should have paternity leave and that a majority of new mothers say they are more likely to return to work if the husband has been paid leave at present just of fathers are given specific paternity leave by their employers a further take annual leave and take time off with the discretion of their manager mr byers will suggest that the governments proposals are simply enlightened business practice as of organisations with more than employees already top up maternity pay figures from the department of social security also to be published on thursday will also show that only of companies need to pay statutory maternity pay each year and that of these are entitled to recover of what they pay out from the state a separate department of employment survey will show that more than half of all employers think that everyone should be able to balance their work and and home life provided this does not jeopardise the needs of business mr byers will also cite surveys showing that half of employers will allow some movement from fulltime to parttime work and threequarters of those would make this available to women returning from maternity leave the green paper which has been the subject of extensive discussion contends that many of the proposed new rights are not enforceable without improved child care
