when jess brookes teenage daughter started running away in the night it was terrifying but in when she arrived home with knife cuts to her face we got the shock of our life says brookes it took a week of careful probing to find out what was going on yearold charlotte was being raped and threatened by a criminal gang in the southcoast town where they live the grooming had begun when she was petrified for her daughters safety brookes phoned her councils child protection team for help they didnt get back to me for absolutely ages literally weeks brookes recalls with incredulity when her increasingly distraught phone calls finally did bring a response it was she says absolutely appalling my approach was to be constructive work in cooperation and to give as much information as i possibly could says brookes but when after more weeks of chasing the social workers report landed she and her husband were poleaxed to find they were being blamed for not preventing the abuse from happening it was devastating reading it was like looking at your life but you dont recognise the people who are being talked about she explains everything wed said was twisted everything was looked at through the lens of suspicion even though we werent the people who were perpetrating any crimes brookes experience is far from unique according to a damning report published today by the charity parents against child exploitation pace the report draws on semistructured interviews and focus group sessions with parents or grandparents whose children were sexually abused outside the home their testimony makes disturbing reading lengthy delays in any action taken not being listened to by social workers feeling that their child had not been helped and that they were often viewed as bad parents or even possible abusers themselves nearly all the participants felt social workers had a poor grasp of child sexual exploitation often minimising or dismissing the physical and mental harm their children were being subjected to by criminal gangs the sexual exploitation my daughter was suffering wasnt part of childrens services discussions says nicholas beale a single father from the west midlands who has brought up his daughter on his own since she was a baby i kept raising it with childrens services but they were constantly questioning my parenting my failings and the language that was used was so patronising condescending dehumanising if it had just been one person id have put it down to their individual failings but it was every social worker with the exception of one an experienced community work professional himself beale says he felt so unsupported that he had no option but to request that his daughter go into temporary foster care the emotional strain took its toll and this he says was used against him by frontline workers determined to find fault it was entrapment encouraging me to take antidepressants which i did and then it was were not sure how dad is coping because hes taking antidepressants he recalls baffled and still clearly angry child sexual exploitation is increasingly high profile with cases in rotherham oxford telford and most recently manchester regularly hitting the headlines gill gibbons is chief executive of pace which supports parents attempting to extricate their children from the clutches of the gangs that serially rape vulnerable teenagers for profit she says that although things have changed from the time of the rotherham scandal when social workers explicitly viewed children as consenting to their own abuse the testimony in paces report leads her to believe the shift away from blaming parents has taken a lot longer it has been hardwired into all the training around child abuse that the first perpetrator you look at is parents she says jenny coles vice president of the association of directors of childrens services and director of childrens services for hertfordshire insists that local authorities understanding of child sexual exploitation has developed in recent years specifically as a result of listening to parents it has informed and improved practice so to hear parents are feeling this way is not what youd want she acknowledges frontline staff she explains are being trained on a huge range of uptodate materials while coles acknowledges that child protection methodology was orginally based on abuse and neglect inside the family she argues that across the country that has been developed to a broader guidance to safety planning and safeguarding for teenagers but according to leeds director of childrens services steve walker in some council areas there is still some way to go while it has taken police and childrens services time to understand the complex dynamics of how child sexual exploitation works i think that agencies now have a better grasp of the issues however the approach taken towards families in some childrens social work departments is problematic he says families are assessed through the lens of risk where they are either causing harm or failing to protect which is unhelpful in all but the most severe cases of abuse as a result families experience social work interventions as judgmental and adversarial this makes it difficult to achieve the kind of partnership with families that is needed particularly where there are concerns about sexual exploitation training can bring good results while pace says parents tell them that police response is still patchy and laws enacted to enable police to disrupt perpetrators such as sexual harm prevention orders are rarely used both brookes and beale maintain that the response they received from police at all levels in their different areas of the country was consistently excellent beales daughter is safe now but the trauma they both experienced over eight terrifying months was made worse he says as a direct result of how social workers dealt with him brookes whose daughter also got away from her abusers says she will never again ask social services for help i would say steer well clear she says simply because unless they start to change their ways they are no help at all the reverse theyre very damaging todays report concludes that council childrens services departments must completely change their attitude to families otherwise opportunities to safeguard children will be lost says gibbons the report recommends earlier and more creative responses from social workers a commitment by childrens services to fostering a genuine working partnership with parents and good relationships with exploited children and better quality multiagency working at the top level the policymakers are supportive says gibbons its percolating that understanding down to the people on the ground that has always been the problem that is the hard work parents are part of the solution theyre not the problem she says they have so much knowledge and information about their child and whats going on its wasted expertise some names have been changed,2020-01,jess brooke teenage daughter started running away night wa terrifying arrived home knife cut face got shock life say brooke took week

new home office measures to tackle the growing crime of stalking risk becoming a retrograde step that campaigners warn could prompt an increase in murders the stalking protection orders unveiled today aim to block perpetrators from approaching their victims and allow courts in england and wales to move quicker to ban stalkers from contacting or visiting victims however some experts voiced concern that the powers could be used as an alternative to prosecutions placing victims at greater risk rachel horman chair of paladin a national stalking advocacy service said this would be a retrograde step and could lead to an increase in homicides horman also a solicitor specialising in stalking and coercive control cases added the only way to keep a stalking victim safe in my view is to ensure that the perpetrator is in custody stalking is about obsession and fixation so nothing less than custody will keep victims safe prosecution rates for stalking offences are falling despite the number of recorded cases rising significantly in there were recorded offences according to the home office a figure that climbed to three years later yet only a quarter of the cases in which a charge could be brought led to one compared with when almost half of reported crimes resulted in further action however the proportion of the population likely to have experienced stalking is far greater according to the crime survey for england and wales almost one in five women over the age of have experienced stalking along with almost one in men a court heard last week that bbc newsnight presenter emily maitlis was left scared and let down after a man who stalked her for more than years was able to continue harassing her despite being in prison edward vines who is serving a second jail sentence for continuing to contact maitlis and her family attempted to breach a restraining order by sending her a letter speaking to bbc radio live in maitlis said the stalking had had a devastating impact on her family you turn into this person who shouts at your kids for the wrong thing she said it just makes you jumpy and thats stressful and its tiring and its timeconsuming the new stalking protection orders will come into effect immediately in addition to banning perpetrators from approaching or contacting their victims the orders can also force stalkers to seek professional help the orders will normally last for a minimum of two years with a breach counting as a criminal offence that can result in up to five years in prison the move was described by the suzy lamplugh trust as an important step in tackling stalking suky bhaker acting chief executive of the trust said we hope to see the new order complement the existing legislation to ensure that victims receive a proactive response when they come forward and report stalking clive ruggles of the alice ruggles trust added that the orders could have protected his daughter who was murdered by an obsessive exboyfriend the existence of spos could have made a critical difference in alices case and will help improve the outcome for many others in the future he said however ruggles added it is critical that there is no delay in arresting perpetrators who breach them any other response may well escalate the risk to the victim but horman who has sat on two parliamentary groups for stalking saidthe home office had not learned the lessons of its domestic violence protection orders which she said had evolved as an alternative to prosecution it is vital that stalking protection orders are used in addition to criminal charges an order does not give the perpetrator a criminal record which is important in helping to protect victims,2020-01,new home office measure tackle growing crime stalking risk becoming retrograde step

the clinical psychologist in a family you need a buffer zone for defusing difficult situations dr cathy burges works with child and adolescent mental health services embedded in youth offending teams in berkshire i dont know whether it comes from seeing some very challenging and disturbing situations at work but i think im reasonably relaxed as a parent there have been times when my teens have done something that i would think is normal like staying out too late or having a drink but other parents have reacted very strongly i feel that young people should be able to make mistakes safely it helps them become stronger adults being a parent has undoubtedly helped me be better at my job and working with troubled young people has certainly helped my parenting i started my career when my oldest child was one so my parenting has grown with my clinical practice my children are now and lots of my young clients have had awful experiences family breakup is just one and being teens their brains arent fully developed so theyre more likely to feel things more keenly my tactic is to ask myself what is the function of that behaviour take an offender who might have been carrying a knife when you dig down and find the reason you begin to understand that maybe theyve been held at gunpoint and felt they had to protect themselves i do ask myself that question with my own kids hopefully they dont think im analysing them i have an office at home which is great for defusing difficult situations my children might say mum can i have a chat in your office please its a buffer zone and you do need one in a family the dentist im happy for them to eat sugary treats at mealtimes but fizzy drinks are banned charlotte waite chairs the british dental association england community dental services committee i work with children with additional needs theyre referred to me because they might have difficulty seeing a dentist because of anxiety or disabilities my own girls are now nine and and having them has made me a better dentist especially when it comes to communication not only with my patients but also their parents sometimes its actually the parents who are very anxious i can see a clear correlation between the parents anxiety and issues their child has theres lots of research to back that up its made me very conscious of projecting my own anxieties on to my children i still supervise both my girls brushing their teeth im happy for them to eat some sweets and sugary treats but only at mealtimes and all fizzy drinks are banned i dont like them having anything too acidic and lollies and rock are awful its the prolonged contact with sugar on the teeth that is a real problem i am afraid im obsessed with children falling and breaking their teeth if one of mine falls its all about ok nice bruise show me your teeth i speak from experience i fell and broke my own front teeth when i was it was traumatic and impacted on my future career choice because it made me realise how important it is that children get really good sensitive dental care the dietician breastfeeding was far from the magical experience id expected bini sureshbabu manages paediatric and adult services for the north east london foundation trust ive always known that breastfeeding is best for a baby so with alyssa who is three i was adamant id do it for six months but she got jaundice lost of her body weight in her first week and ended up on formula after that i struggled it was painful i didnt enjoy it and it was far from the magical experience id expected it to be in the end i stopped at around three months and these days id tell patients to aim for six months but that the most important thing is to look after yourself when i was a child we werent allowed to leave the table until wed finished our meal but now we know that can make children into fussy eaters all the same ive sometimes shocked myself by saying things designed to guilt trip my children into eating there are children in the world who dont get the food you get the thing about children and food is that its so easy to let your anxiety get the better of you for example i know the right thing to do with a child whos being fussy about food is to offer a meal give them time to eat it and not offer an alternative if its not eaten but there have been times when alyssa has refused food and ive gone to find alternatives with reeve who is one i dont do that another mistake i made with alyssa was to try to avoid a mess when she was eating id cover her in a bib and wipe her hands if they got food on them but children need to explore and have fun with food the childrens counsellor when they do tests at school dont ask what did soandso get laura campbell is employed by the spark which provides schoolbased counselling in scotland like many parents ive often made flippant remarks to my children lewis nine and carrie five to get them to do things then later when ive been in a counselling situation ive realised how much children take things to heart sometimes ive come home and apologised to my own kids as a result one little boy told me he was frightened because his mum had told him hed be taken away if he didnt behave and i realised id said to my son a similar age that if he wasnt well behaved a mythical scottish figure called maggie murphy might come to get him its easy to underestimate the effect on a child of what you say its also so easy to worry about how your child is doing in relation to others we all do it but ive realised the crucial thing is to put your own child first so when they do tests at school dont ask what did soandso get because youre setting them up to feel that impossible things are expected of them which is very damaging they end up believing nothing they do will ever be good enough and then they become reluctant even to attempt anything my son lewis for example is focused on becoming a footballer id love nothing more than for him to succeed i know i should be realistic but i dont want to burst the bubble so we sat down with a piece of paper and wrote professional footballer in the middle then we wrote down all the other jobs he could do that are connected with football manager coach sports therapist trainer its made him realise that everything doesnt rest on one single outcome its taken off some of the pressure but means he can still reach for his dream the financial expert my kids get pocket money but they get half for good behaviour and half for doing chores russell winnard is director of programmes and services for young money ive tried hard as a parent to talk about money with my children societally its still quite taboo chatting about rent mortgages how much it costs to turn on the lights and tv kids need to know but you have to remember that normal financial interactions you take for granted as an adult can seem baffling to a child talking through what happens when you pay for a basket of shopping by waving your card at a scanner with no actual cash leaving your wallet is actually quite important my kids get pocket money but they get half for good behaviour and half for doing chores its about making the link between doing and earning sometimes its hard especially when your kids get bigger and the things theyre after get more expensive one of mine wanted festival tickets which we paid for on the understanding that wed be paid back with additional chores so far thats not happening as fast as i would like research tells us that at the age of seven children are starting to form spending habits so you should instil values that will help them respect and understand money its about simple experiential learning and sometimes its hard for schools to do this taking groups out to shops isnt easy its something ive done with all three of my children who are and taking them shopping showing them how money works how to budget a shop is crucial the speech and language therapist i thought i had to crack the naughty step and fretted that it didnt work then i decided to trust my knowledge of my own child jude philip is cofounder of nonprofit organisation grow communication the way i work has changed massively since becoming a parent before i had children id give advice to parents who brought theirs to see me but it wasnt until i became a mother that i realised how hard it is to follow through my first child aidan died shortly after he was born and thats helped me bring compassion and humanity to both my work and my parenting aidan was born with potter syndrome which affects kidney development i remember hearing a fellow speech therapist refer to one of their clients as being syndromey and cringed that was someones child they were talking about i try to see each child as an individual putting children in developmental boxes is handy but its simplistic its far too easy to become influenced by people telling you what to do i remember thinking i had to crack the naughty step and fretting that it didnt seem to work i decided to trust my knowledge of my own child and have the confidence to deal with it in a different way its really helpful as a parent to be in contact with young people professionally i love the insight they give me i think its a mistake to claim youre an expert in any aspect of your life its always important to keep an open mind my other two children and those i work with always show me that the child psychologist i remember clearly using biscuit therapy to keep my toddler quiet these are the realities of parenthood selina warlow is a child psychologist my job is both the worst and best for being a parent on the one hand im so fortunate to have the research and theory at my fingertips but on the other hand it does magnify parental anxiety when my first child was very young i was dealing with children with autism spectrum disorder and adhd and then came home and watched my very active baby rolling around i found myself doing what i would advise my clients to do creating a diary filming her building up a developmental history in reality she was just being a normal baby but because i had the theory in my head i had set off on a new path this is exactly when i really value my husbands input were two halves of our childrens parenting as a clinician its very easy to disassociate when its not your child you can dispense all kinds of advice but you have to be careful of doing so within a bubble you need to see how that advice sits in the context of a family the parental emotional pull is very strong take the principle of time out yes its a space for a child to reflect and think and thats what i would tell clients but sometimes id do it with my own children and just want to get them back for a cuddle i also remember all too clearly trying to breastfeed my second baby and using biscuit therapy to keep my toddler quiet these are the realities of parenthood my worst fear is meeting a client in the supermarket with both my children its guaranteed that theyll be rampaging and ill have no control if you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for weekend magazines letters page please email

i was thinking it wasnt abuse because he never hit me these are words that will stay with suzanne clarke her daughter hannah clarke who was burned to death in brisbane last week with her three children told her mother that she had questioned herself for years about whether she was in a domestic violence situation with hannahs father lloyd and her brother nathaniel the devastated mother told a current affair her daughters story of the control and manipulation that preceded her ultimate fear for her physical wellbeing this is such a tragic event said nathaniel we want to be able to help people in a similar situation to what my sister was in and maybe raise awareness of early signs of domestic abuse that are not easy to see not all domestic abuse is physical and as lloyd added we didnt see it for a long time as in the terrible moment australia learnt of yearold luke batty who died at the hands of his father while his mother rosie looked on the camp hill incident of a man throwing petrol over his three young children and his wife in their car and then stabbing himself as they burned brought the urgent question of how to keep women and children in domestic abuse situations safe to the front of the national conscience again our laws have assumed for many years that people who eventually wield deadly violence are physically violent before that and so policing has attempted to reduce homicidal violence by prosecuting lesser violence such as physical assaults on an incidencebyincidence basis but as it has become clear many homicides of women and children by the womans partner or former partner are not preceded by any physical violence hannah clarke was not subjected to physical violence by her husband until he killed her and her three children aaliyah laianah and trey when they were together hannahs former partner controlled microscopic details of her life he told her what to wear he punished her with silence he monitored her phone he isolated her from her family hannahs family said the control presented itself in small ways like the fact he wouldnt allow hannah to wear shorts or walk off the beach in her bikini little things like that in the beginning we just thought hes a prude in hindsight we know there is more to it suzanne said yet hannah knew she was in danger after leaving her partner in november she took a domestic violence order against him which he breached three times in quick succession as he became increasingly desperate he abducted one of his daughters and took her interstate until police recovered her the week before she died hannah asked her mother what would happen to her children if he killed her this conscious awareness that her partner was becoming a risk to her life is what researchers call the golden thread of coercive control and it is this golden thread that is the most accurate predictor of the unleashing of deadly violence london researchers andy myhill and katrin hohl reported in that the dangerous patterns of coercive controlling behaviour were the best predictor of the risk of domestic homicide better than assessing danger by physical assaults alone mainland australia has no laws that directly criminalise nonphysical domestic abuse such as psychological abuse or coercive and controlling behaviour behaviour that makes the victim dependent on or subordinate to the perpetrator behaviour that isolates a victim from family and friends monitors their communications deprives them of autonomy or decisionmaking power or that frightens humiliates degrades or punishes them australia has been arguably very slow to reform a report by the australian law reform commission more than years ago found that domestic violence victims found police to be dismissive towards complaints of domestic violence and that sanctions imposed by the courts were seen as ineffective american researcher evan stark wrote a book in that raised the critical importance of nonviolent control of intimate partners via coercive control that gradually destroys the personhood of their partner he says offenders typically intimidate their partner via daily actions including isolating them cyberstalking sexual coercion financial abuse and emotional abuse and micromanaging their dress speech activity and work according to myhill and hohl police need to ask about coercive control to understand the degree of entrapment of the woman this would reveal the amount of assistance she needs to build support networks so she is able to leave safely deakin university researchers paul mcgorrery and prof marilyn mcmahon called last year for authorities to consider criminalising coercive control in australia following the successful introduction of laws in the uk and especially scotland the death of hannah clarke and her children is a shocking crime that has galvanised public sentiment towards the need to stop domestic violence murders mcmahon says however she says it would be a big mistake for australian legislators to rush through poorlydrafted legislation as a kneejerk response to appear to be doing something we need to recognise the crisis and then we need to have a reasoned response she told guardian australia if we talk to victims they will often say the psychological abuse the intimidation the coercion the controlling behaviour is the worse part apart from the most extreme forms of physical violence controlling behaviour is often a precursor to violence and homicide it is a very potent warning sign but controlling behaviour is also a wrong in itself and we should try to find ways to eliminate it that said mcmahon believes people should not have to live in fear they shouldnt have to live subject to the control or coercion of others if we agree on that that is the impetus for criminalisation the critical question then is how do we do it she said mcmahon points to scotlands domestic abuse bill as the new gold standard although we havent yet received empirical information about how its working mcmahon says anecdotal information suggests the laws have enabled authorities to punish behaviour with significant jail time that would otherwise have been difficult to prosecute including stopping a partner from seeking or continuing employment inspecting a partners home or body for evidence of infidelity threats to expose private photographs of a partner or expartner threatening selfharm to prevent a partner leaving a relationship threatening to harm a partners pets demanding that their partner eat certain foods or that they sleep on the floor queensland and south australia are the only states that have so far considered introducing coercive control legislation mcmahon does not recommend that the rest of australia should copy the tasmanian legislation that criminalised economic abuse and financial abuse because it was poorly drafted and has been rarely used she believes the scottish legislation is as good a starting point as any but warns that legislating to criminalise psychological abuse is so different from physical injury that prosecutors and police will need training in the mechanics of evidencegathering and prosecution we need to get our prosecutors on board we have to get our police on board we need the council of australian governments the attorneys general to look at a model offence and then introduce it she said in queensland doing nothing is no longer an option according to womens legal service ceo angela lynch same old same old is clearly not enough queensland has already implemented the recommendations of the not now not ever report but still women are dying she says womens legal service wrote this week to the premier anastasia palaszczuk calling for coercive control to be criminalised in queensland and for the new laws to be embedded in a broader strategy to respond to violence against women and children and accompanied by comprehensive training for police lynch says one positive impact of coercive control legislation would be that police would need to take a full history of violence in a relationship instead of their current incidentbased approach had coercive control already been a crime in queensland hannah clarke may have been asked for a complete history of her husbands abuse of her including the threats intimidation and sexual abuse the husband could have been charged with a criminal offence the system could have responded in a more serious away he might have been denied bail if he was released he might have had strict bail conditions or a tracking device lynch said this week queenslands opposition leader deb frecklington called for coercive control legislation among a package of other strong measures to reduce domestic violence and intimate partner homicide we owe it to hannah clarke and countless other people who have lost their lives and survivors of domestic violence to make sure we look at a suite of reforms she said in australia if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault domestic or family violence call respect on or visit respectorgau in the uk visit the national domestic abuse helpline website here or call in the us visit the national domestic

in australia a national outcry over domestic violence has been sparked by the murder of hannah clarke and her three young children burned to death by her husband and their father former rugby league player rowan baxter who then stabbed himself to death in the uk the office for national statistics has reported that the number of women killed by a current or former partner has surged by nearly a third hitting a year high eighty women were killed in familial violence in the year to march a rise of on the previous year last week the latest annual uk femicide census compiled by the admirable karen ingala smith and clarrie ocallaghan also reported that women were killed by men in the uk in more than half the perpetrators had a history of violence towards women in eight killings the defence of rough sex gone wrong was claimed a domestic abuse incident is reported every minute in england and wales yet where is the public outcry shamefully the ravages of austerity have put many more women at risk closing refuges slashing legal aid axing specialist domestic abuse services where is the national demand for a sharp reversal it is almost years since the first refuge opened in chiswick london but change has been too slow as internationally recognised domestic abuse consultant davina jameshanman argues limited resources focus too much on high risk when attention to lowerrisk patterns gives women and children the opportunity to break free from the violence so much earlier the domestic abuse bill once enacted may help for instance in strengthening the power of the police response but so much more is required incredibly the uks first domestic abuse commissioner nicole jacobs does not sit at the pms round table on violent crime domestic abuse is not genderneutral it is largely a male crime against women from of victims of domestic violence were female while for domestic homicides of female victims and of male victims were killed by men inequality and the patriarchy are at its heart most women stay with abusers out of fear lack of finances absence of viable alternatives or unwillingness to uproot children but the real question is how do we stop men from across the economic spectrum killing abusing and controlling women and children this article was amended on march the original version said that of male victims of domestic violence were victims of men this was in fact the figure for male victims of domestic homicide this has been corrected and the figure for female victims of the crime also included for domestic violence as a whole evidence suggests that where victims are male a significant number of perpetrators are female,2020-02,australia national outcry domestic violence ha sparked murder hannah clarke three young child burned death husband father

we have two granddaughters aged nine and five the nineyearold is bright and lovely most of the time however if she doesnt get her own way she can be awful she recently came to stay with her mother and younger sister the first day was fine but the next day we had planned various attractions and booked tickets but the nineyearold didnt want to go we went anyway as her sister did and my daughter had to work she then kicked off was obnoxious rude and disobedient we came home early and tried to stay positive cheer everyone along and distract her but nothing worked as a punishment i didnt let her use her tablet my daughter backed me up but doesnt usually take it away i gave it back before bed as my daughter says it settles her it keeps her quiet at home she is on the tablet nearly all day and doesnt want to go anywhere i also feel shes not allowing the fiveyearold to grow up shes very clingy when her mother is around but fine when she isnt she wont go to sleep without her mother my daughter goes to bed with her and hasnt slept in the same bed as her husband for years i worry seeing my daughter so tired she also has no time to herself how can i help it would be easy to fixate solely on the nineyearold and dismiss her as badly behaved but i think shes the one showing up most clearly what is going on this is a fairly disordered family with a desperate need for boundaries and where is the father all i know from your letter is that he snores your daughter meanwhile seems to have to manage both work and childcare with your help during the holidays why i consulted dr alexandra de rementeria childpsychotherapyorguk she homed in on the fathers absence and wondered if his leaving the marital bed was a consequence or the cause of the fiveyearold sleeping with her mother i am an advocate of attachment parenting i have let my children sleep with me when they need extra comfort and i see nothing wrong in answering their needs however in doing that it is also really important as the fulcrum of the family to understand and attend to your own needs de rementeria explained that although your daughter seems to be available at all times to her children she actually isnt if we do this we are not really in charge of ourselves we lose our ability to distinguish ourselves we lose our backbone the very thing that makes us interested and interesting put simply your daughter is exhausting and martyring herself she doesnt seem to know where she ends and her children begin this is neither healthy nor desirable in the long term i wonder where her idea of motherhood comes from does she think she should be constantly available to her children is she afraid of saying no and does she equate this with bad mothering i wonder what she feels guilty about and if that makes her unable to be authoritative the nineyearold seems to sense as de rementeria says a power vacuum and is trying to fill it your daughter needs to do something equally powerful back to get into the drivers seat and take control her daughters overreliance on the screen is telling de rementeria explains the screen gives the illusion that she can meet her needs herself that she doesnt need adult attention but she cant and she does hence the angry terror when it is taken away i feel for your older granddaughter the unit of her mother and little sister is quite impenetrable where does she fit in does her mother make room for just her what is her bedtime like does a screen really put her to bed de rementeria thought it was gratifying that she seemed to respond to your authority a boundary at last although tempting to ignore or distract from her behaviour as you did on your day out its important to recognise and contain her feelings imagine if you were really angry and someone tried to distract you wouldnt it make you even madder try saying you seem really angry this way you are acknowledging her and her feelings but without relinquishing control or giving in if the father cant step up and help to establish boundaries ask if you can help your daughter to do that it wont happen overnight because a lot of needs are going unmet in her family send your problem to

more than half the women killed by men in the uk in were killed by a current or former partner many after they had taken steps to leave according to a report on femicide the fourth femicide census conducted by the campaigner karen ingala smith found women were killed by men in the number of deaths is an increase of on the previous year and the highest number since the census began of the deceased women were killed by a current or former partner only of murders were committed by a stranger of the women not killed by current or former partners were killed by their sons or stepsons while five were killed by a soninlaw or former soninlaw in half the cases perpetrators had previous histories of violence against the victim or other women with three men found to have killed before one had been convicted of manslaughter in and jailed for three years the second who also had a history of stalking had been released from prison in after murdering his previous partner in the third had been convicted of culpable homicide in and had also been convicted of serious violent offences in and the most common method of murder was a sharp instrument with strangulation or asphyxiation the second most common the majority of killings occurred either in or immediately around the womans house ingala smith who runs the domestic violence charity nia said many of the women had expressed fear and warnings about their killer to police other services and friends and family of the women killed in of those killed by a current or former partner had left or were in the process of leaving with of these women killed within the first month and killed within the first year after separation its important that we challenge received wisdom about seeing leaving a violent relationship being a straightforward way that women can remove themselves from the danger of a violent partner ingala smith said the report released on thursday found that overkilling defined as the use of excessive gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to cause the victims death was evident in of cases younger women aged between and were more likely to be subjected to extreme gratuitous violence according to the report it added that while such attacks were often described as frenzied and resulting from a loss of control the evidence suggested that was not the case in one femicide the postmortem carried out on the victim established that most of the plus stab wounds inflicted were very shallow indicating a high degree of control and suggesting the perpetrators intent to torture the victim before inflicting the fatal wounds the report said the femicide census produces a report every year of women killed by men in the uk it aims to provide data on the killings of women by men and aims to highlight patterns and trends which can feed into policy and service responses and in particular prevention and early intervention according to the report there is a high degree of normalisation of mens violence against women and no end of excuses or rationales assumed and extended to perpetrators often without foundation said ingala smith a cofounder of the census she added that closure and

the latest uk femicide census shows that despite more than years of feminist campaigning against male violence the number of women and girls dying at the hands of men is increasing the annual report on such crime in the uk shows that of the women killed in the vast majority died at the hands of a current or former partner were killed by sons or stepsons five by a current or former soninlaw only nine were killed by a stranger or where there was no known relationship three of the perpetrators had killed women previously karen ingala smith the founder of counting dead women from which the femicide census grew first collected data in january she began after looking into the death of kirsty treloar a young woman who had been in touch with a domestic violence charity ingala smith was involved with it was later found that treloar was murdered by her boyfriend once she started ingala smith found she could not stop no one else was doing this work and yet domestic violence alone kills times more women annually than terrorism as a feminist campaigner i am often asked why women are still targeted by male rage our successes have been significant were it not for feminist campaigning rape in marriage in a number of countries would not be a crime and there would be no specific laws against domestic violence but why then has this not led to fewer women dying in recent years domestic violence services and refuges have been closed down or replaced with generic cutprice facilities run by those without any expertise on crucial issues such as risk factors and why women return to violent men significant cuts to legal aid are also a massive barrier for many women seeking injunctions against abusive expartners as is the fact that there are many migrant women with no recourse to public funds who are often turned away from refuges and since former justice secretary chris graylings disastrous reforms to the probation service more male offenders with histories of serious violence towards women are being classed as low or medium risk and released from prison take the appalling case of lisa skidmore who was brutally raped and murdered in by leroy campbell a sexual predator who was deemed to be medium risk by the probation service campbell had numerous previous convictions including rape burglary and attempted strangulation of a woman he had been released from prison only four months before he raped and killed skidmore after serving years for an attack on another woman six weeks before murdering her while out on licence campbell told his probation officer that he felt like doing it again strangulation was a factor in of the femicides compared with between at the same time increasing numbers of defendants are using the rough sex gone wrong defence and claiming that the victim consented to violent and dangerous sexual practices resulting in a womans accidental death in eight of the killings the perpetrator made this claim recently published research found that more than a third of uk women under the age of report having experienced unwanted slapping choking gagging or spitting during consensual sex in five cases children were killed with their mothers in other cases children witnessed the killing the damage to those children is immeasurable and yet where is the support for them we must believe women when they say they fear for their lives it is up to all of us neighbours friends family members and teachers to look out for signs of domestic abuse and report it but we also have to recognise that women are not just in danger from partners and expartners stalking and harassment of women by colleagues and acquaintances can lead to disastrous consequences for the victims and yet these cases are often badly handled by police and rarely successfully prosecuted these women die because there is a virtual amnesty on male violence the conviction rate for rapes is at an alltime low just of those reported the women who die as a result of male violence tell us an important story these dead bodies symbolise the tyranny under which all women to one degree or another live the men responsible for their deaths have committed extreme acts of patriarchal violence and it is easy for other men to distance themselves from these crimes but the fact is that so long as any form of male violence and abuse of women and girls is tolerated the morgues will continue to bear witness to its inevitable and tragic consequence julie bindel is a journalist and activist and the cofounder of justice for women,2020-02,latest uk femicide census show

new figures showing a rise in the number of female victims of murder manslaughter and infanticide in england and wales in the year to march to its highest level for years are extremely concerning so is an increase in the number of homicides in which the victim was under to its highest level since caution must always be taken in forming conclusions based on a single years figures the human tragedies behind such data are shaped by a multitude of factors but it is impossible not to be disappointed that violence against women and children increased during a period when the government was led by a prime minister theresa may who counted domestic abuse among her personal priorities almost half of the killings of women and girls were domestic with involving a partner or expartner while of the victims aged under including boys and babies aged less than one were killed by a parent or stepparent this figure is set to rise as a perpetrator has yet to be confirmed in of child homicides and killings of children by strangers are very rare it is too soon to assert conclusively that the trend in killings of women and children is upwards until the number of female victims of homicide had fallen in most years since the early s when a spike included the female victims of harold shipman but the rise in homicides of women and children who are mainly killed by partners or close family members in contrast to men who are more often killed by friends or strangers means that home life for women girls and boys has become less safe after several years of sharp rises last years fall in the number of male victims is hugely welcome as is a fall in the number of those aged these figures contributed to an overall decline in the homicide rate but while it is neither possible nor helpful to point to a single reason either for this development or for the rise in killings of women and children it is essential to put both into context by promising to increase police numbers by ministers have in effect acknowledged a link between police cuts and rising crime mrs mays domestic abuse bill which would have strengthened protection for some victims fell when decembers general election was called budgets for refuge and crisis services have been stretched beyond breaking point meanwhile an increasingly chaotic situation in the wider criminal justice system has led to welldocumented failures with the position with regard to rape prosecutions especially dire recent guardian research showed that the number of cases referred for charging decisions fell by in the year to september while it is wise to be cautious about asserting causes and effects it is surely not farfetched to suggest that violent men could be emboldened by such circumstances and that women will continue to

the number of women killed by a current or former partner has surged by nearly a third fresh figures have revealed as overall numbers of female victims of homicide hit a yearhigh there were women killed by a partner or ex in the year to march the office for national statistics ons said an increase of from the previous year and figures showed the total number of female victims of homicide that is murder manslaughter and infanticide increased from to the second annual increase and the highest number since the year ending march there were separate homicide incidents in the period up from the the previous year and the highest since when there were the ons said sarah green the director of the end violence against women coalition said this rise in domestic violence murders is extremely worrying we need an urgent detailed examination of every case and what failings they have in common alex mayes external affairs manager at the charity victim support said it is deeply disturbing to see that more women are being killed in part due to a rise in homicides as a result of domestic abuse working with the families bereaved by murder and manslaughter we know that the impact of these crimes is devastating to both families and communities these statistics highlight the fatal impact of domestic abuse and show how much more needs to be done to tackle abuse and keep victims safe the homeless charity crisis is calling for the government to guarantee a safe home for anyone fleeing domestic violence in the forthcoming domestic abuse bill hannah gousy head of policy and external affairs at crisis said these figures are a devastating reminder of why its so important for women experiencing domestic violence to have somewhere safe to escape to and how our continued failure to act is having fatal consequences we know that leaving an abuser can be one of the most dangerous times but currently were leaving women with no option but to return to the very place and person they were trying to flee from because they have nowhere else to go this is truly shameful we can and must do better than this overall there were victims of homicide a figure that is or lower than the previous years total it is the first fall since although this was partly due to those killed in the london and manchester terror attacks and the shoreham air crash being included in the figures the ons said the drop in offences recorded as murder manslaughter or infanticide in the month period was driven by a fall in the number male victims which went down by from to the number of baby girls and toddlers killed in the period also reached a decade high with homicide victims including females under the age of one and toddlers aged between one and four these are the highest numbers since the earliest available figures when six baby girls and eight children aged between one and four were killed in the year to march the most common method of killing continued to be stabbing with homicides

uk often in coercive relationships or unsafe places of shelter threequarters of refugees who responded had been left destitute by the twists and turns of the immigration system mostly after their claims were refused and had experienced depression onethird had tried to kill themselves the statistics are all the more troubling because for many women the need to talk frankly on arrival in the uk to a stranger from the home office about the abuse and persecution they experienced in their home country is simply too hard a task who has the words after trauma and via an interpreter to tell all that and who would have the strength to lay the details of their terror bare before officials who appear primed to disbelieve them here three women share their experiences and hopes in words they wish they could have found sooner veronica all her life veronica has escaped one lifethreatening situation only to find herself in another she grew up in uganda and was raped when she was just eight i think that made me become a lesbian she says i grew up seeing that a man can really kill you in uganda homosexuality is illegal there have been attempts to make it punishable by death so when veronica was caught in a romantic embrace with a fellow schoolgirl the guardian who had paid for veronicas medical treatment after she was raped felt such shame that she took her to a police station there she was tortured and raped still veronica refused the marriage her guardian had arranged for her instead she was sent to england on a student visa the aim was to make sure i stayed in this country veronica says it never occurred to her to apply for asylum i didnt understand that one day the visa would finish and id be in trouble she held a job cleaning trains for three years until immigration officers arrived one day at am to take her to colnbrook removal centre in west london in detention all the trauma of her life in uganda rushed back upon her she lied repeatedly in order to avoid telling the one thing that might have earned her asylum i thought let me die silently with my sexuality she says how could i tell them i was too scared on the basis of her fabricated story she was released and allowed to appeal one stranger after another offered her places to stay nowadays veronica folds herself on to a couch most nights another stranger took her to hackney migrant centre in east london where she finally came out to a gay volunteer asylum seekers can be hostages to fortune with lives turning on chance meetings with strangers i said im a gay woman but all my life ive been lying after saying this she felt something shift i thought no matter if they deport me ive found my people my family its a type of joy veronica has made a fresh asylum claim that tells her full story but she is destitute she wont apply for accommodation because she fears being sent to live outside london and losing the support of the rainbow sisters group for lgbt refugees and asylum seekers id love to work pay for my own house sit on my own toilet she says it might seem an unlikely aspiration to most of us but to veronica it symbolises the height of privacy and guaranteed sanctuary you know how happy i would be to have my own toilet that is my dream she says mariam after she fled war in somalia and arrived in kenya the elders of mariams bajuni clan organised her safe passage to england through an agent the agent accompanied her on the plane and on arrival in london led her to a supermarket then left and never returned mariam has no idea which supermarket because she did not speak english she was rescued only after many hours when a customer noticed her distress mariam claimed asylum the next day but had to wait years to be granted refugee status the language analyst assigned to her first application judged that she was not native in the language she claimed as her own kibajuni despite the interview being conducted in swahili to be told in english a language she did not speak that she did not speak her mother tongue cast a long shadow over mariam he ruined my life she says he was not speaking kibajuni but the home office believed his words instead of believing me i was in pain i came to tell my story and the officials sat down and said no we dont believe you mariam is now having spent the precious years that took her from middle age towards later life in limbo in somalia mariam had been raped and four of her children had been killed by militiamen but it was only in the uk thanks to years of shifting from hostel to hostel relying on charities for food and shelter and attending more tribunals than she can recall that she became depressed in somalia i had family i was sharing the pain there were a lot of us suffering speaking the same language but here i couldnt share it with anybody the pain became so much more in my country i feared the war but here i feared the home office i have been tortured every day mariam receives universal credit and has temporary tenancy of a council home but the years of uncertainty have left a mark i know im safe now she says but i dont feel safe gloria gloria was detained by soldiers from the democratic republic of the congo while attempting to seek refuge in a neighbouring country the man who organised glorias release paid for her flight to the uk and took care of her papers in london he drove her to a new home which had lots of doors although gloria used only one it was always locked until the man came with the key to let himself in he was using me like a wife she says i want or i dont want we do sex all night all night a frenchspeaking cleaner from cameroon helped gloria to escape she led her to a congolese friend giving gloria a chance to tell someone what had happened she said id like to go and find the government for this country if i go there maybe they can help me this interview is the first time she has shared her story of being trafficked in full from being raped and abused repeatedly by soldiers in the drc to being trafficked and seeking asylum all the critical moments in glorias life seem to place her in buildings with doors she cannot open at the asylum intake unit in croydon south london her interpreter who didnt speak her language lingala led her to understand that signing a form would secure her accommodation she pictured a house signed and at am arrived at yarls wood detention centre in bedfordshire i came from torture from abuse i was locked up back home i come here and they lock me up again she says for gloria the process of seeking asylum in the uk has mimicked some of the experiences from which she sought refuge detention and the psychological torment of not being able to see her way to a safe exit now gloria is destitute since her arrival six years ago the home office has considered rejected reconsidered and rerejected her claim the name she gave her real married name did not match the name her trafficker had given her she has had a year in

tickets from the red cross and gets clothing company and advice from wrw in the day she stays on her feet my eyes seeing on the floor if i can find money she says when a police car passes my heart

sara mayers youngest child often asks mum how many days will we stay here each time she tells him they wont have to move again but so far she has been unable to keep her promise in mayer fled her abusive husband and went to the uk from mainland europe with her two children but he found them the family moved and tried to settle somewhere new but time and again he tracked them down in he locked himself in the house with his teenage daughter who only escaped when mayer arrived with the police he then texted his daughter repeatedly saying he would kill her mother six months later when mayer turned up at school bloodied and accompanied by police her daughter stopped speaking to her for the fourth time in five years they had to uproot their lives moving town changing school and leaving their friends like many in their situation the family was in danger of ending up on the streets domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness government figures show that in the year to june almost people were made homeless in england directly because of domestic abuse for those fleeing it is increasingly difficult to find a space in a refuge which offers temporary accommodation and intensive support councils cut funding for domestic violence refuges by almost a quarter between and and last year womens aid found that of all referrals to refuges were declined its study showed of people fleeing domestic abuse end up sofa surfing and almost sleep rough while waiting for a space to become free finding settled accommodation can be even harder according to latest government figures just of households made homeless because of domestic abuse between april and december were offered social housing as a result survivors can face homelessness or returning to their abusers when their time is up at a refuge this is because councils are only required to provide housing for domestic violence survivors if they can prove they are more vulnerable than the average homeless person its actually incredibly difficult to prove vulnerability because the evidence required is hard to obtain says hannah gousy head of policy at crisis one woman who fled her home says she was asked by her housing officer to get a letter signed by her abuser stating that he had raped and attacked her in wales and scotland cuts to refuges have been less swingeing and crucially anyone fleeing from or threatened with domestic violence automatically has a legal right to housing this means the situation is much less acute for the people who became homeless in those countries following domestic violence in the year to april the welsh government decided in that anyone fleeing domestic abuse would be considered in priority need for housing the amount of resources that councils spend investigating vulnerability in essence working to find reasons not to help people would be much better spent directly helping people to avoid homelessness says heddyr gregory of shelter cymru scotland abolished priority need altogether in alison watson the deputy director at shelter scotland says that means women fleeing domestic abuse will be considered homeless and given temporary accommodation and help to find a new permanent home for some this creates a safe escape route where none existed before alison brown has experienced the stark difference between the levels of support available from english and scottish councils she was living in the north of england when her partner threatened to kick the unborn child out of her belly the abuse got worse when her son was born and on two occasions her partner put them both out on the streets she told the council they were homeless because of domestic abuse but was turned away so she went back to her abuser i had to just bite my tongue and stay where i was i couldnt be homeless with a baby brown says i was so scared of him people always say just leave but its not easy when youve been emotionally worn down to a point where you are totally stuck it took me a lot to be able to get up and leave one night in when her abuser was asleep she got her keys and drove straight to scotland and then took a ferry to an island off the coast where she was offered temporary accommodation womens aid helped her apply for permanent housing and she recently got a secure tenancy for a twobed property in england charities are lobbying for a change in the law as part of the domestic abuse bill so that anyone who is homeless because of domestic abuse is considered in priority need for settled housing the bill abandoned when boris johnson called the general electionis expected to be brought back to parliament before easter sandra horley chief executive of refuge says women are passed from authority to authority with each failing to take responsibility for housing women and children escaping violence and abuse those who councils agree to house once they come out of a refuge can be put in wholly inappropriate emergency accommodation such as bed and breakfast with shared bathrooms where single men and alcoholics are staying women can feel isolated or unsafe again which often sends them on a downward spiral says beki turner the housing lead at charity rise which runs a domestic abuse refuge in brighton it was at this refuge that mayers caseworker found a space for the family to start rebuilding their lives mayers face lights up when she talks about her son who settled well at his new school her daughter was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and received intensive support from mental health services she too seemed to be improving the family was due to leave the refuge after six months but despite their circumstances brighton and hove council did not deem them enough of a priority for settled housing they ended up staying another three months at the refuge at great expense to the council which pays not just rent but all the additional costs of specialist support that refuges provide local authorities are trying to address this situation rise has developed a project with the council to prioritise survivors of domestic abuse so they can move straight from its refuge into longterm accommodation the project is due to be implemented this year sylvia peckham head of housing needs at brighton and hove council says were trying to build on the positive move forward and free up the refuge for the next families that need that level of support in august mayer and her children finally moved into a twobedroom private rental largely funded by the council near her sons school and her daughters psychologist mayer has modest hopes for the future she wants to stay in brighton and find a job she says if my eldest starts school its like i have everything her son drew a picture of his hopes which he showed his teacher saying i want a house and my mum to be happy because she cries all the time hopefully one will lead to the other some names have been changed,2020-02,sara mayer

domestic abuse experts are calling on the government to provide emergency funds as refuges prepare for an influx of referrals amid fears the covid outbreak will fuel violence in the home at least violence against women and girls organisations including womens aid have signed a letter to the ministry of housing communities and local government mhclg calling for action over one of the unintended consequences of the coronavirus lockdown in a separate intervention the domestic abuse commissioner nicole jacobs has said the government must provide support to the charities that provide lifeline services for victims of violence in the home throughout the crisis as they face major financial strain the letter composed by the public interest law centre and solace womens aid and which has also been signed by more than civil society organisations and lawyers including the refugee council and doughty street chambers warned that the lockdown will cause rates of violence and abuse in the home to increase isabella mulholland a domestic violence caseworker at the public interest law centre said we are concerned about the disproportionate impact that lockdown measures are having on survivors of domestic violence it is unacceptable for the government to simply point to a general fund which has been allocated to all those in need instead it must secure specific funding for survivors to ensure they are able to access specialist services and safe and suitable accommodation the reality is that local authorities are unable and in many cases unwilling to support and protect women effectively unless the government provides adequate resources guidance and training unless and until this happens survivors will continue to suffer the letter demands a separate emergency fund for local authorities to ensure they are able to adequately house survivors of domestic abuse in appropriate locations speaking to the guardian nicole jacobs who was appointed domestic abuse commissioner in september said early indicators showed an increase in demand for services run by charities for victims of domestic abuse the national domestic abuse helpline run by the charity refuge reported a increase in calls to the helpline on saturday compared with the same day the previous week and traffic to its website and use of web chat facilities have increased smaller helplines focused on family courts and male victims of violence have also reported increased calls jacobs said smaller charities will come under significant pressure during the crisis and called for government assistance to keep the vital services afloat she said there is a postcode lottery of the provision of these services this is layering more stress on a rocky foundation these are great services but they are going to struggle financially if there is no overarching strategy from government targeted to domestic abuse and sexual violence services that are going to struggle to make ends meet and will be dipping into reserves to get through the period karen ingala smith the founder of a pioneering project that records the killing of women by men in the uk said she had noted an increase in deaths in the past two weeks ingala smith chief executive of domestic abuse charity nia and founder of the counting dead women project said initial analysis of her data suggested there had been a higher rate of killings in the last few weeks her figures showed at least eight women have been killed by men in the past two weeks with a further four suspected cases this is compared with women who were killed by partners in the year to march which equates to nearly two a week women are isolated trapped with abusive men so theyre exposed women have less access to support not just community support but services like ours women will not be able to have face to face meetings she said official uk government advice for victims of domestic abuse during the public health crisis says it is in regular contact with the charity sector and the police to ensure that support services remain open during the outbreak an mhclg spokesperson said domestic abuse is an abhorrent crime and its victims must always be fully supported we will do everything we can to help domestic abuse support services keep vital provision fully functioning during the covid emergency we are working closely with charities organisations and councils involved in providing these services and the domestic abuse commissioner to ensure those fleeing abuse have a safe place to go to the scottish government announced extra funding of m to scottish womens aid to ensure the maintenance of key support services and alternative access via online video platforms and text messaging as ministers insisted that the message to stay at home should not deter women from seeking urgent help at her daily briefing on tuesday the first minister nicola sturgeon said there is a real risk that women and children already subject to domestic abuse will feel even more isolated and vulnerable during this crisis so this funding will ensure they have access to support services police scotland said that it would be actively working to identify those most at risk but that it was too early to assess the impact of coronavirus on incidents of domestic abuse across the country,2020-03,domestic abuse expert calling government provide emergency fund refuge

alison is glad the sun came out at the same time the coronavirus lockdown arrived im spending all day on the balcony to keep away she explains im lucky i have one alisons balcony offers her a small degree of distance from her partner whose behaviour has become increasingly erratic since the coronavirus crisis began for the estimated million women who experienced domestic abuse in england and wales last year home isnt a place of safety rather than a chance to catch up on a boxset or long delayed diy project self isolation for women in coercive or violent relationships means being trapped indoors with your abuser alison assures me her partner wont hurt her hes had these episodes before she tells me over a messaging app referring to bouts of heavy drinking that have intensified since the government introduced social distancing measures but hes the worst ive known him for a long time she connects her partners moods with the pandemic he gets angry with me for being super careful about wiping things down and insisting he washes his hands she explains he thinks im being over the top hes angry with me for acting like a mad person and calls me paranoid but hes putting my health at risk too since the outbreak the charity womankind in bristol has had a number of new callers some have directly referred to the strain of being isolated with their partners for an extended period the counselling charity relate has recorded an uptick in enquiries related to the pandemic of its calls in the week leading up march mentioned coronavirus though some of these calls will have been about cancelled appointments rather than relationship issues charities are concerned the lockdown has left many vulnerable women trapped indoors in unhappy relationships all the methods people might have incorporated to relieve their distress are not available to them any more says ammanda major head of service quality and clinical practice at relate some people will be connecting with friends online but that doesnt take you away physically from the problems in the relationship theres nowhere to go when youre in lockdown major is concerned that coercive and violent partners will see this as an opportunity to up the ante because they essentially have a captive the adverse effects of the pandemic is felt most acutely among the vulnerable the old the sick the financially insecure people trapped in abusive and unhappy relationships also fall into this vulnerable category police forces are already reporting domestic abuse cases linked to the lockdown during normal conditions victims of domestic abuse can seek help outside the home or at work staying with friends might have been an option when things got too difficult now many are stuck in the same space as their abuser the window for seeking help has narrowed the home secretary priti patel has confirmed that women can leave violent households to go to a refuge during the lockdown the trouble is after a decade of cuts many refuges have closed one in six has shut its doors since a coalition of charitable groups has called for an immediate cash injection to support refuges and domestic violence services during the coronavirus crisis and many services are facing a difficult dilemma should they close their doors to new arrivals in order to prevent the spread of the virus or remain open for victims some refuge services will have to lock down and stop taking referrals due to the virus other domestic violence charities have begun offering online support but for people with controlling partners who monitor internet activity even seeking help online can be a risk help is still out there for women enduring domestic abuse the charity womensaid has published guidance for staying safe during the outbreak including a silent solution system for victims who may be afraid of further harm if theyre overheard calling there are things friends and family can do too even while social distancing if you know you have a friend who is at risk from a partner major says see if there is a way you can contact them digitally to check out how they are you shouldnt refer to the fact you think their partner is controlling because that might put them at risk she adds but checking in being there for somebody it can help that person back on her balcony the strain of managing her partners moods has led to alison suffering from dreadful anxiety even talking to loved ones feels out of reach she doesnt want to worry them at an already anxious time i really need emotional support she says its breaking my

all crisis situations said marcy hersh a senior manager for humanitarian advocacy at women deliver what we worry about is just as rates of violence are on the rise the accessibility of services and

there has been a rise in domestic abuse incidents directly related to the coronavirus outbreak according to a police leader beverley hughes greater manchesters deputy mayor for policing and crime said there had been reports of abuse linked to the lockdown and said authorities were preparing for serious incidents after a meeting of the regions covid emergency committee lady hughes said i think we are beginning to see a rise in domestic abuse incidents we anticipated this might happen in the very stressful circumstances for many families charities and police forces across the country have been warning of a potential rise in cases of domestic violence in china there was a threefold increase in cases reported to police stations in february compared with the previous year the justice secretary robert buckland told the commons justice committee this week that there may be more cases of domestic abuse online crime and fraud during the lockdown hughes later said the overall level of domestic abuse cases was as expected but officers had begun to classify incidents believed to have a connection to the virus she said families were being asked to stay at home and many had significantly less money as a result of the restrictions hughes said the potential for tension to arise in the home as a result of what we are asking people to cope with in order to suppress the virus is going to increase and therefore we would be right to think this might display itself in an increase in the number of domestic incidents we are called to we are preparing for that some of those most serious incidents will be challenging to deal with particularly if the victim needs to be moved to a refuge but the police specialise in these kind of cases and the local partners local authorities theyre working together really closely to prepare for that avon and somerset police reported a increase in domestic abuse incidents in the last two weeks from to police in cumbria have asked postal workers and delivery drivers to look out for signs of abuse dci dan st quintin of cumbria police said in the coming weeks and months we ask for everyone to look out for each other as much as possible we would also like to extend this plea to those such as postal workers delivery drivers food delivery companies and carers who will still be visiting houses to keep an eye out for any signs of abuse and to report any concerns to us quintin said the bright sky app which can be disguised for people worried about partners checking their phones provided support and information for victims the national centre for domestic violence said it fully supported the plea and warned of huge dangers lurking for victims its chief executive mark groves said while the whole country grapples with the consequences of covid there are huge dangers lurking for victims of domestic abuse and violence we fully support cumbria polices plea to key workers to help the police investigate suspicions or concerns surrounding victims or perpetrators the thames valley chief constable john campbell said his force expected to see a rise in the number of domestic abuse calls he said domestic violence and fraud would become a priority for his force as criminals decide to change their behaviours to take advantage of coronavirus we are seeing and monitoring very closely the issues around domestic abuse we anticipate that it might increase and we will deal with that robustly in a way that you would expect us to campbell said shanika varga a solicitor at stowe family law who specialises in domestic abuse cases said being stuck in a house together for two weeks or longer means the risk of a situation becoming violent is much higher lots of people whether they realise it or not are in abusive relationships and abusers will typically manipulate any situation to take advantage of their perceived position of power varga urged victims to start thinking of a contingency plan for escaping their abusers knowing your options and making sure people are informed and fully prepared to take action if need be is vital dont forget that help is out there she said,2020-03,ha rise domestic abuse

on ordinary days when people arent talking about pandemics i work from home while caring for my threeyearold daughter ive had many years to refine my lifestyle as a freelancer but other parents may now find themselves thrown into the same situation without preparation or choice if childcare centres close because of coronavirus parents will have long tiring days at home with their children playgroups and other social activities will be limited or nonexistent and parents may need to work from home this is already a reality for some people who have chosen to stop sending their children to daycare or to limit their reliance on vulnerable grandparents for babysitting so how can families adapt amanda abel a paediatric psychologist in melbourne reminds parents this is not forever while it is a very trying time and the uncertainty around timeframes is proving unbearable for some it can be really helpful to increase our sense of control as this is often how we manage our anxiety solid blocks of time are precious abels strategies for taking control include speaking to employers about expected working hours an evening shift could be an option or working in bursts so there is time to give children undivided attention as a parent working from home i am grateful my daughter still naps solid blocks of time are precious and should be used for work that requires deep focus not distractions like social media or television and not housework my daughter loves to fold laundry and cook dinner so we do these things together when shes awake children learn through play my previous career as an early childhood teacher taught me that opportunities for play and learning are everywhere parents dont need expensive toys and structured activities to replicate an early learning program in childcare centres educators encourage children to discover what is interesting to them i know about six different recipes for playdough but i havent made any in months my daughter prefers playing in my shoe cupboard she made a dog by threading wooden beads on leftover christmas ribbon this is an activity she created herself that develops imagination and finemotor skills michelle walsh an early childhood trainer and consultant says children learn through play whether its playing with barbie dolls or toy cars playing imaginary games dressing up or being a dog it doesnt matter what theyre playing they are learning walsh suggests parents prepare their homes for play first thing in the morning it could just mean putting puzzles on the floor or setting up some playing cards or a clipboard for drawing then let the day flow show children the passing of time to guide behaviour positively distraction is an excellent technique for babies and toddlers abel says set up some boxes with activities or materials in them that are relatively novel for the children bring these out during important meeting times or for when you need to knuckle down and get some work done children closer to school age will have improved selfcontrol and an understanding of boundaries and time abel suggests using a timer to show children the passing of time while youre working or creating a visual schedule for the day set up some house rules with the kids so they know what the behavioural expectations are during this time give them information they can process after overhearing an adult conversation my daughter said she was sad because so many people were sick talking to young children about covid isnt easy but it cannot be avoided children are impacted by other peoples fears and dramatic changes to their normal routines abels primary message to parents is to ensure kids arent getting information that is developmentally inappropriate for them only give them the type and amount of information that they can process at their age most kids should really only know that theres a virus going around which is like the flu and for most of us it wont be a big deal but the community is working really hard to make sure that it doesnt spread too much i try not to let external stresses stop me from being patient with my daughter but it isnt easy i am much more tolerant of thrown toys and emotional meltdowns when there is toilet paper in my house and now more than ever children need patience and support from the people they love one of the most helpful things parents can do is contain their own anxieties around the situation because as parents our anxiety gets transferred to our kids abel says when in doubt turn to bluey one of the best things for my mental health is sitting on the floor playing with my daughter i prefer to do other things in my downtime and i dont always feel like it trust me but i know it benefits us both i encourage eight minutes of play a day with your children walsh says its just like a bluey episode for anyone who hasnt seen a bluey episode i encourage you to watch one and then choose to play with your children for eight minutes a day its not very long but it really enhances their learning,2020-03,ordinary day people arent talking pandemic work home caring threeyearold daughter ive many year refine lifestyle freelancer parent may find thrown situation

it has been a busy week for adolescent therapist alicia drummond as soon as the government announced schools were closing parents and teachers started begging her for advice about teenagers cut adrift from their friends life goals and daily routines theres suddenly a massive demand from parents wanting to know what to do she is hosting a webinar this week on parenting in isolation via her website teentipscouk and says the first spaces sold out in five minutes parents are really worried and ive had schools on the phone saying please can you do something on how to cope with everyone being at home couples have also been consulting marriage counsellor deborah parker on how they can both work from home with their children in the house all day and not end up in the divorce courts something ive been discussing with couples is that this particular unprecedented scenario is very much teetering on either explosion or irreparable damage within a family or the collectiveness of the family will actually help heal all those times of tiredness and stress when couples dont see each other and have grown apart for this reason its vital parents are realistic about the hours they can work from home while their kids are off school couples should concentrate first and foremost on their children says parker if work takes precedence then children often feel ignored or unappreciated that can lead to adverse behaviour negative feedback and playing up and daily life for couples can become just too overwhelming to ease these tensions she recommends parents work in shifts taking turns to supervise the children and set aside time to chat and listen to each others concerns each day in a room away from the kids nerys hughes clinical director of whole child therapy acknowledges that creating a routine for children is important but she warns parents against taking on the role of their childs teacher if it causes conflict not least because stress hormones can make people more susceptible to a viral infection your number one job as a parent at the moment is to keep your children well and that means looking after their mental health as well as their physical health she says instead of worrying that children are not doing enough schoolwork parents should view the enforced break as an opportunity for some childled individualised learning which most schools struggle to offer i would say to the child lets write down all the different things that you could use this time to learn do and experience then every morning ask them to put a schedule together made up of those things says hughes children and teenagers should also be allowed a few duvet days where they can do whatever they want that way they may be more willing to take a structured educational approach on other days and for example learn a new skill you could say to them you are so lucky you are one of the few year groups ever to get this opportunity how are you going to use it says drummond teens may not yet have twigged that in the future universities or employers will be asking them how they spent their time off hughes predicts that the three main things that children are going to miss are their usual routine their chance to connect with their community and their opportunities to be successful and accomplish things we need roles identity and productivity even from the age of three one way parents can help even young children to feel productive while they are at home is to enable them to help out with housework or cooking it doesnt matter if the accomplishment is curriculumbased it can be learning to make mum a cup of tea putting pasta in a bowl or drawing a picture for someone so they feel connected to the people they are missing even if that gift never gets given because you are selfisolating the child has felt that moment of connection teenagers in particular may miss their friends terribly and due to their adolescent brains feel invincible and omnipotent in the face of the virus warns drummond theyre wired for experimentation without the ability to weigh up longterm outcomes because they may impulsively decide to take risks its worth explaining why guidelines need to be followed my rule of thumb with parenting teenagers is ask dont tell so ask them why do you think were isolating what do you think the ramifications of you meeting up with your friends might be if they do sneak out dont turn it into a big drama instead reiterate why its important that they dont do it again whatever happens dont try to try to punish your teen by taking away their tech what we have to be deeply careful of is not letting them become too isolated we all know that isolation has an impact on peoples mental health and thats particularly true for adolescents encourage them to stay connected to their friends virtually in a healthy way rather than going out and putting other people at risk its also important to keep children informed about matters in the wider world that affect them says parker often children prefer to be told what is going on than to be suddenly given the shocking news that grandmas passed away because she got the virus,2020-03,ha busy week adolescent

by now we all know that voluntary social distancing is key to mitigating the spread of covid in the grand scheme of things lying low for a little while is a small sacrifice to make for the increased safety of all though it certainly will pose challenges not least of which being to our relationships it will become easy to think of one another as a burden writes the atlantics helena fitzgerald especially when we are cooped up together or when isolation breeds feelings of abandonment this raises the question how can we best manage the unusual social circumstances were in what if im stuck with my roommates in engineer ansley barnard spent eight months living in an isolated dome habitat with five other scientists as part of nasas hiseas program which was developed to simulate the experience of traveling to mars during that time she learned several lessons applicable to anyone living with roommates talking about a potential conflict early on prevents things from getting worse says barnard our strategies in the habitat were to be open about our feelings and avoid blame it can help to carve out private places in the same home so that you can decompress alone if you need to she says barnard and her team ate dinner together every evening using that time to set aside any issues and work on their relationships with each other i think having a positive attitude and looking at your situation as a temporary opportunity instead of a setback can help keep you moving forward she says what if its just me and the kids according to joshua david stein editoratlarge of the parenting publication fatherly if youre practicing social distancing with your kids now is the time to readjust your rule structure just like how when you take kids on a plane they can watch as much tv as they want its kind of the same at least for now he says fatherly has compiled a list of athome activities for bored kids the internet abounds with kidfriendly podcasts museum tours and educational videos and stein notes that its a good time to get outside and take advantage of local parks too if your kids are worried about grandparents theyre unable to visit during the pandemic stein suggests without lying frame it in a way that will assuage their worries as much as possible like grandma is doing fine for her safety and our safety were going to rely on facetime for now its also to be expected that your patience will wear thin at times youre going to freak out at your kids a little bit says stein its not the best thing in the world but its not the end of the world dont beat yourself up about it try to do better next time what if im suddenly spending a lot more time with my livein partner this is a situation where you kind of know what is going to happen so you have time to come up with a gameplan says erin davidson a couples and sex therapist chat about what to do in moments where things are stressful normalize that its ok if you get on each others nerves and decide on a signal that means ok we need to take a moment in separate rooms or recognize better communication is needed or perhaps someone needs a hug or to talk about emotions that are coming up davidson says both partners should get comfortable asking for and giving each other space while it may be a tricky time to date lowrisk symptomfree partners living in relative isolation together can certainly use this time to have more sex theres a website called mojoupgradecom and its fun because both of you fill out yesnomaybe questions about sexual things you want to try individually and then it only emails you with the things you both matched up with a yes on she says its a lowpressure fun thing you can do what if im alone for the last three years writer and musician kristal jax has been making ironic barbieheavy memes about coping with mental illness trauma and social issues which she posts to her instagram account dyingbutfine several of jaxs recent posts have centered on covid including a quarantine bingo meme and a multipost filled with ideas for how to distract yourself while home alone such as by crafting cleaning or making your own memes i find humour is a way to connect and let off steam when youre really upset or anxious just have some kind of catharsis she says in addition to taking on domestic projects jax says reaching out to offer support to others if youre able is a good way to feel less alone i find helping people during times of crisis really helps you control your own anxiety because youre like oh i have a purpose she says if you dont know someone well enough to know how they would feel about you checking in on them you could still send a message to them saying hey im checking in on friends right now do you need anything and if youre

ivone vera sits in a small room in a beauty salon in campo grande brazil where she spends her days waxing clients its an intimate space with a bed a table in the corner bare walls and no windows within the privacy of these four walls over the last three years she has heard countless stories of womens abuse at the hands of their male partners what i hear in this room really affects me and sometimes i dont know what i can do there are times i lie awake at night not able to go to sleep thinking about what ive heard she says vera is one of the first cohort of beauticians in the city to receive training by the states justice department aimed at teaching salon workers how to spot the signs of domestic abuse and encourage women to report the crime it is part of mos empenhadas contra a violncia hands committed against violence one of programmes set up by judge jacqueline machado and her team in in response to frightening statistics detailing the extent of violence against women in the centralwest state of mato grosso do sul brazil is the fifth most violent country in the world for women and according to figures from mato grosso do sul with a population of million people had a rate of murders of women per compared with sao paulo which has more than million inhabitants where the rate was vanessa vieira a social worker at the states justice department trying to combat violence against women blames a patriarchal culture we have a rural mentality men see themselves as the boss of the family women are there to help and work for men these attitudes pervade throughout the state irrespective of their socioeconomic background most women frequent beauty salons in brazil and often build an intimate relationship with the professionals there an afternoon training programme for beauticians teaches domestic abuse law covering financial and emotional abuse as well as physical violence they learn why many women stay in abusive relationships and are told what services are available to help workers are shown a film do improvisation exercises and have conversations around the subject vieira says ive seen women who have broken down in tears because they realise that they too have been victims of violence to date beauticians have been trained at sessions in campo grande and salons are participating reaching more than clients a month three beauty schools have signed up as well as travelling beauticians leaflets about violence against women are distributed in the salons six months after the initial training questionnaires evaluate its impact so far clients have revealed that they were living in an abusive situation although there is no data on how many clients have sought further help or left their abuser or pressed charges the project has already been replicated in seven cities in six different states across brazil in her waxing room vera recounts how after her training she helped her sister escape a violent relationship her sister had been with her husband for four years when he started calling her names and telling her that she was fat and ugly the aggression got gradually worse until one day when veras sister raised the issue of unpaid bills he grabbed a knife and pointed it at her threatening to kill her she grabbed hold of it and cut her hand before she fled to her room and locked herself in he left soon after and she my sister called me to help her we went to report the crime and the police came to arrest him now she has a restraining order against him vera uses this story to convince her clients that they can do the same i listen to women i tell them they need to be strong and ask for help i tell them theyre a victim and where to report the crime in another salon in a wealthier neighbourhood naara lippel a manicurist remembers one client who spoke to her about her boyfriend at the time they were engaged and he had starting yelling at her and calling her names she asked me what i thought says lippel i told her she was a victim of violence and that things could get worse she left him and told me that i had helped her take this decision at first i thought i had gone too far but now she is married to another man and is really happy thank god i said something because at least shes not a prisoner in a relationship i dont know for sure but if shed stayed with him i think things would have got worse

yesterday was international womens day you might have been alerted to this when an empowering discount code landed in your inbox but it feels hard to spend too much time being vexed by the cringey corporate interference when women are still being murdered on school runs and in their homes and dying in police custody women were the victim of homicide in australia last year nine have already been killed in according to womens safety advocates the government is ignoring experts and not doing enough we have bigger things to be angry about a conversation about domestic violence was one of the first sessions at this years all about women the annual sydney opera house festival also devoted panels to topics like ageism the women of isis race sexual violence and abortion with a speaker lineup including yael stone clementine ford and chanel miller the survivor of the stanford university rape case keynote speaker lindy west cancelled her appearance late last week here are four takeaways from the event its time to rethink the way we police family violence australias law enforcement system failed hannah clarke and her three children it will continue to fail other women unless drastic changes are made journalist jess hill the author of stella prizenominated see what you made me do called for australia to adopt a network of femalecentric police stations like those found in argentina these stations are largely staffed by women focus entirely on family violence and offer services such as childcare financial counsellors legal help and psychologists for women trying to leave abusive relationships they are designed to be welcoming spaces that encourage women to report violence earlier before it escalates and they work hill says the domestic homicide rate where these police stations are present has been reduced by overall and its been halved among year olds because younger women who have not yet had children with abusive partners are more likely to seek intervention before they become stuck in relationships you dont have to walk into this big forbidding police station hill said youre greeted at the door your children are taken care of and theres no onus on you to go to court or do any of the things australian police say is up to you to be a good victim why wouldnt we try something like that hill asked why not do something radical its proven rejecting beauty standards isnt that simple if we accept that conventional beauty standards harm women does trying to conform to them betray the sisterhood its fraught author and appearance activist carly findlay says she doesnt wear makeup or filter her photos because she believes its important to show our real faces she is adamant that people who are appearancediverse need to be seen as they are and to be constantly representing for those who dont have a platform author bri lee wrestles with similar ideas when deciding what she posts on instagram lee says the line is very clear for me that she would never use an app to facetune her appearance but she acknowledges that if you take photos and pick the one where youre posing to look the slimmest youve not exactly opted out of the patriarchy or even just putting foundation on could be conceptualised as putting a filter on your face lee says where do you draw the line if you engage to any degree how can you judge people at the far end regional australia needs better alcohol solutions adults residing in outer regional and remote australia are times more likely to drink to dangerous levels than those in major cities campaigner shanna whan a woman from rural australia and recovered alcoholic says we need to do more to help australians living outside our capitals to find help she says the bush has unique challenges when it comes to kicking booze there are louder narratives around it being unaustralian not to drink and fewer alternatives to the pub as a site for social gatherings geographic isolation means youre more likely to go big stints without seeing friends or family so when you do get together at big parties or football games the focal point is alcohol and no ones going to show up to an aa meeting in a small town where anonymity doesnt exist but whan borrowed a steps axiom to explain why regional australians desperately need to be able to talk about the issue nothing survives in the darkness youve got to bring it out into the light the common thread of womens resistance through history women have turned to a particular method of activism textiles unlike prohibitivelyexpensive paints explained artist stanislava pinchuk the needle and thread is a medium women have always had available to them its also one that could be made very visible and yet communicate messages too dangerous to yell through a megaphone

womens safety advocates have accused the morrison government of ignoring the advice of experts when it comes to protecting women and children from domestic and family violence instead reannouncing an already controversial scheme the social services minister anne ruston used international womens day to announce the government would put m into a nointerest loan scheme which provides loans of up to to people fleeing violent situations the microloans were part of a package announced by the then families minister paul fletcher and former minister for women kelly odwyer in but faced criticism from advocates concerned about the ongoing costs for vulnerable women as they attempt to rebuild their life already behind financially hayley foster the chief executive officer of womens safety nsw said the government had failed to commit to any serious action in addressing domestic violence across the nation this m could be going directly into the specialist frontline domestic violence services which support women and children to escape and recover from violence foster told guardian australia but instead its being funnelled to a separate agency that women would have to negotiate with and be case managed by in order to access the funds and then repay them with respect whoever has developed this policy has not consulted with or thought about the actual experience of women escaping domestic violence and the services whose job it is to support them through this process foster said advocates were not consulted over the funds and their advice on where money needed to be directed was ignored what is really inexcusable is that we have a national body set up to advise the council of australian governments on reducing violence against women and their children under the national plan the australian women against violence alliance awava and the federal government has spent this m on this initiative without even going through this advisory body she said what is the point of a national advisory body made up of womens safety experts from across the nation if the government is going to just dismiss ignore and bypass it we know that in order to address this enormous social problem of mens violence against women and children in our society we are going to have to be very smart about how we use our resources bypassing the expert body in the making of these decisions is therefore not just disrespectful its also irresponsible women in australia are nearly three times as men to experience violence from an intimate partner while one woman a week on average is killed by her current or former partner after the shocking murder of hannah clarke and her three children the prime minister scott morrison said all levels of government and the legal system needed to reflect on how the family was failed i believe state territory and national governments all of us and our agencies and importantly the judiciary we must all reflect again on these terrible murders he told parliament last month we must reflect on how and where the system failed hannah and her children as it has failed so many others it is so frustrating its so devastating the issue was raised at the council of australian governments meeting where womens safety ministers once again met to discuss changes that could be made to the system experts have repeatedly called for increased funding to services and for those affected to have access to financial help that will not cost them down the track as well as more counselling accommodation and a more coordinated national response the labor leader anthony albanese repeated his calls for a national summit on domestic and family violence on sunday we need to make sure that theres a comprehensive plan he said it does require finance but it also requires listening to the experts ruston told sky news on sunday that while governments were working to address the scourge of violence against women the community also needed to step up we should be ashamed of ourselves in australia that we have the kind of domestic violence perpetration that were seeing she said but until we can convince everybody in australia that they have a role to play in stamping out domestic violence thats not just the federal government or state and territory governments its the community its individuals and really encourage men particularly as role models to start stepping up to the plate and if you see something that you think is disrespectful behaviour towards women then actually go and call it out for what it is because until we change peoples behaviour were just going to be responding to domestic violence and we have to start preventing it hannah clarke and her three young children aaliyah laianah and trey will be laid to rest on monday the family were killed

in dorothy giuntacotter was shot and killed in her own home in massachusetts by her husband and relentless abuser of years william cotter he then turned the gun on himself dorothy had fled from him with their two daughters a few days earlier because cotter had begun to hurt their yearold but she had refused the offer of a refuge she told the police that if her daughters were with her cotter would find them and kill all three she attempted to avert the worst of two terrible outcomes wrote the american journalist rachel louise snyder in an article published in the new yorker in the loss of her daughters lives along with her own that article a raised hand became part of eight years of research from one of the frontlines of what the world health organization who has deemed a global epidemic snyders work is now an awardwinning book no visible bruises what we dont know about domestic violence can kill us in the uk the issue of domestic abuse is not taboo which snyder says the subject still is in the us here while it may be a family secret it is recognised and discussed nationally the impact of austerity on closing refuges slashing legal aid and axing specialist domestic abuse services has kept the issue high on the uk agenda its a crime that impacts on men too but women make up the overwhelming majority of victims eighty women were killed by a partner or ex in the year to march an increase of on the previous year while an incident of domestic abuse is reported every minute in england and wales the government estimates that the social and economic cost of domestic abuse is a staggering bn a year snyder combines the forensic eye of the investigative reporter with her skills as a professor of creative writing but there is an added empathy she explains that when she was nine her mother died her father remarried two months later and became unstinting in his beatings to rein his daughter in violence swirled around me she writes its this personal experience that perhaps helps her to coax women their families and the men who have abused and killed to speak out patrick for instance a retired federal official middleclass narcissistic who murdered his daughter and wife and believes they will be waiting for him in heaven with open arms snyder also talks to the criminologists public health workers domestic abuse advocates police and lawyers who are fighting to stop the harm working in an arena that has its own unique frustrations and challenges as snyder writes love is what makes domestic violence different from other crimes visiting an intensive prison programme to help abusers to change snyder tells a circle of men that she too had been a highschool dropout she too knows about violence i was a rebellious teenager she tells me now on the phone from her home in washington dc i was smoking cigarettes at pot at after her mother died my father married a woman i met on the day of the wedding and took my brother and me to live miles away my dad believed women were secondary to men my brother me and two step siblings were spanked often in an assembly line i wasnt afraid to fight back in september all four teenagers were kicked out of the house snyder dropped out of high school at she worked as a waitress living in her car the manageress let me sleep on her couch for a month they were good people at she says i knew the life id lived for the past three years would also be my life for the next unless i got an education on my mothers side i had an uncle who was a heart surgeon another had devised the tv show the addams family my grandfather was a professor and a poet in snyder without any qualifications presented herself to rick spencer responsible for admissions and grants at her local university north central college in illinois i knew she had been on a rough road but there she sat that took guts she still has that spark says spencer now vicepresident of institutional advancement at the university he gave snyder her chance two weeks into my first semester i loved it says snyder now a tenured professor after her studies she became a foreign correspondent reporting from more than countries before returning to the us in once she began investigating domestic abuse on her home patch she says she realised that here was a crime that linked many of the issues she had covered abroad including child brides in romania and the forced sterilisation of women in tibet across the world women are killed every day by familial violence domestic abuse she writes is as common as rain no visible bruises was published in the us last year halfway through a national book tour last june snyder flew home to washington dc to attend her yearold daughters fifth grade graduation at the airport she received a voicemail from a close friend michelle somethings happening at jasons she said michelles brother jason rieff and his wife lola golumova both diplomats based in washington dc were due to finalise their divorce lola had been given custody of the two daughters and intended to take them overseas on a fouryear posting at am on the morning of june while the girls were at school jason who had bought a gun days earlier shot and killed lola and then shot himself in the us women a month are shot dead a month are killed in total in familial violence i had to tell my daughter that her friends daddy killed her friends mummy then killed himself snyder says her daughter jazz knew how death was delivered with a gun she said i ask snyder why she thinks the rates of killings and abuse are escalating the metoo movement calling out male behaviour has triggered a backlash she suggests just because women are seen to be winning though doesnt mean those men are losing and in britain and the us we have elected macho misogynistic authoritarian leaders that set a tone the violent response has become increasingly normative ten years ago on her return to live in the us snyder met suzanne dubus and kelly dunne who worked at the jeanne geiger crisis center in amesbury massachusetts up till then snyder writes she had always thought that domestic violence was the unfortunate fate of the unlucky few she believed that restraining orders kept women safe that victims could easily leave a relationship if it became bad enough that courts punished men who were violent dubus and dunne taught her otherwise in they had tried to help dorothy giuntacotter supporting her when she filed a restraining order on her husband which he broke and finding a room for her and her two daughters in a longterm shelter which dorothy refused in the wake of dorothys death dubus and dunne were prompted to create the first domestic violence high risk team now emulated in the uk and many other countries to work out how to deal with abusive men more effectively the team brings police hospitals courts state legislature and other professionals together to share information and prevent domestic murder by intervening early in dorothys case detectives had no knowledge of the times william cotter had hospitalised his partner communication between professionals is what makes a difference snyder says thirty years ago a breakthrough in understanding and communicating the clues that point to domestic abuse came in the form of the work of jacqueline campbell in maine and her danger assessment tool which helps health professionals to identify victims she now travels the us teaching others how to use the tool among the risk factors campbell identified are threats to kill extreme jealousy forced sex stalking and a womans isolation strangulation is also a vital clue strangling to the point of loss of consciousness can cause brain damage and internal injuries often not recognised yet of victims in the us are strangled at some point in an abusive relationship drawing a timeline to identify a pattern of abuse as it unfolds sharing the information among frontline collaborating professionals is vital campbell stresses in this way an escalating pattern of control andor violence is revealed and understood as so much more than an isolated accident yet still in the uk according to davina jameshanman who reviews domestic abuse murders for the home office scarce resources mostly go to highrisk cases for instance where attempted murder is flagged up and not to lowerrisk cases where intervention much earlier in an abusive relationship gives the woman a chance to break free snyder says that after the deaths of jason rieff and lola golumova among the first to send their love and support were the mothers of michelle and rocky mosure michelle had had two children with rocky before she was rocky appeared the perfect husband but he was also exercising coercive control over michelle a crime in the uk since but not in the us but in aged michelle was breaking free she had returned to education and had a restraining order on rocky he broke the order michelle went back to him snyder says women return for a variety of reasons including their lack of finances the paucity of protection the fear soon after rocky shot dead michelle his two children and then himself does snyder believe abusers can stop turn themselves around jimmy hasnt abused for years she says jimmy espinoza was a drug addict pimp rapist and serial batterer he had also been sexually abused as a child he became a group leader of a programme to help men desist from abuse in the book snyder notices a poster on the wall at one meeting how do you persuade a yearold to stop beating his wife talk to him when hes across the board the violent men i met didnt want to be violent snyder says what they dont know is alternative behaviours they dont understand that where there is greater equality in a relationship its generally stronger and more satisfying she says that among the measures that may make a difference in tackling domestic abuse are better training for the judiciary and the police constant analysis of risk education in schools and innovative initiatives such as protected housing so a woman doesnt have to uproot herself and her children and travel miles to a refuge snyder wants to trigger an international debate about domestic violence and has her own ideas she proposes an app to provide advice to teenagers distinguishing for instance stalking and harassment from romance and a helpline for men who want to stop the violence and control the uk has a call line respect when snyder had her daughter she was reconciled with her father and stepmother barbara close to death barbara revealed that she too had been a victim of domestic abuse in a previous marriage the book is dedicated to her prevention education and early intervention all matter but something far more fundamental and deeprooted also has to shift because inequality and male power are at the root of this epidemic you have to take the longer view of history snyder says until very recently for instance it was legal for a man to rape his wife im an optimist i have to believe that change is possible no visible bruises by rachel louise snyder is published by scribe to order a copy go to guardianbookshopcom free uk

investigative journalist jess hill interviewed dozens of abused women domestic abuse sector workers male perpetrators childrens advocates and system experts over five years in order to write her awardwinning book see what you made me do here she answers some questions about issues arising from the murders in brisbane of hannah clarke and her three children aaliyah laianah and trey hannah clarkes family described her husband rowan baxter as controlling coercive and obsessive his abuse appears to have followed a familiar script known as coercive control can you explain this coercive control is a very particular kind of domestic abuse its not a reaction to stress nor is it triggered by alcohol or drugs its an ongoing system of control in which the abusive partner seeks to override their partners autonomy and destroy their sense of self the end game whether the perpetrator knowingly sets out to achieve it is to make their partner entirely subordinate a willing slave to do this they isolate micromanage humiliate degrade surveil gaslight and create an environment of confusion contradiction and extreme threat the feeling victims have as the british survivoradvocate min grob tweeted the other day is that the rug has been pulled from under your feet you become disoriented hyper vigilant confused and most likely sleepdeprived you are walking on eggshells afraid youre going mad afraid to make them mad afraid all the time sometimes not even knowing why youre in fear but the panic is there always this abuse can also be incredibly hard for the victim to detect because it happens slowly bit by bit its the total mental dislocation of coercive control which amnesty international has classified as torture that is the hardest thing to recover from coercive controllers may use extreme physical or sexual violence or as was reportedly the case with rowan baxter no physical violence at all for more than years women and children have been saying that except for extreme violence the coercive control is the worst part in fact one of the most common refrains from victims of coercive control is i wish hed just hit me if domestic abuse cases almost always follow the same script as you write in your book why is it so hard to stop them so many reasons but in cases of coercive control i think it boils down to this many women dont know they are experiencing abuse until they are already in situations that are incredibly dangerous partly because coercive control is so poorly understood but also because the perpetrator makes it invisible by the time victims realise the danger theyre in many believe no system will ever be powerful enough to keep them safe if they do report to police if something reportable actually occurs they are making a terrifying gamble will they get an officer whos sympathetic and proactive will reporting their partner make him more dangerous what if child protection gets involved what if he contests for custody there are absolutely no guarantees that they or their children will be protected their suspicion that the system is not powerful enough to protect them is too often correct the justice system is not only full of holes too often it actively colludes with the perpetrator especially the family law system so they stay even after they want to leave and know its dangerous they stay because it may be even more dangerous to leave until the justice system properly assesses and responds to risk and as long as women are made to be responsible for their own safety we will continue to see an intractable domestic homicide rate how do some men come to feel so entitled to their power over women thousands of years of patriarchy has laid pretty good groundwork for this and its not so long since a wife was considered her husbands property and had no legal rights whatsoever it was only in the s that new laws against marital rape recognised that men didnt have the right to demand sex with their wives anytime they wanted prior to that consent was considered to have been given on the wedding day and never revoked today we still live in a society that entrenches womens subordination at every level from the home to the boardroom to our parliament even in the courtroom as we see so often as the harvard psychiatrist judith herman writes the legal system is designed to protect men from the superior power of the state but not to protect women or children from the superior power of men im sure any survivor reading this will know exactly what shes talking about men dont abuse women because society tells them its ok men abuse women because society tells them they are entitled to be in control in fact society says that if they are not in control they wont succeed they wont get the girl they wont get the money and they will be vulnerable to the violence and control of other men it says that if they fail to assert themselves like real men they will end up poor and alone but we dont just see men being entitled to power over their partners some women identify with this too thats because having power over is valued within patriarchy much more for men than it is for women but nevertheless it is regarded generally as a sign of strength to claim power over others to add more complication in many perpetrators who have had trauma or attachment disruption in their childhoods you get another layer of entitlement as one perpetrator told me i never had any control over anything as a child and i vowed that i would never let that happen to me again i would always be in control traumabased entitlement is very common in people who are abusive the notion that i had to go through so much so fuck you you just have to deal with whatever i do to you when that entitlement is thwarted there is this notion of being defied of being humiliated of being shamed this is what has been called humiliated fury when insecurity toxic shame and entitlement combine that is a very dangerous emotional state do behaviour change programs for men work opinions and studies on this are mixed here in australia group therapeutic programs generally run for a few months once a week a recent study by monash university found that of men report that they are violence free or almost violence free two years after the program ended that is a very encouraging result there are a couple of residential therapeutic programs like breathing space in western australia and roomchange in canberra that i think are also really promising they give men a place to live so women and children dont have to leave and they follow up intensive individual and group work with months of ongoing outreach support indigenous mens programs throughout the country are also some of the best ive seen in terms of reconnecting men to what is meaningful but the model i keep coming back to is one that actually takes seriously the deep work that is required to shift men out of longhabituated behaviour its a scottish program called the caledonian model and it runs for two years it combines two approaches to offending that are typically at odds with each other the psychopathology model which looks at what drives a specific person to abuse and the feminist model which looks at how men are socialised under patriarchy and how gender inequality underpins their abusive behaviour to do this it gives abusers six months of oneonone counselling to begin with and puts them in touch with specialists who can deal with any other presenting issues addiction mental illness childhood trauma etc after that they go into a group program with other men where they confront issues around gendered expectations socialisation what actually constitutes abuse and so on then they go back into oneonone counselling throughout that time caseworkers are also working directly with their partners or expartners and their children its a fantastic model how can you help a friend if you think they are being coercively controlled when you first hear those red flags isolation micromanagement rulesetting financial control you need to respond carefully listen without judgement criticise their partners behaviour but dont condemn their partner that may only make them defensive comment on the changes youve notice in them personally and why youre worried about it most importantly dont give up the perpetrator wants their partner to be isolated dont enable them stay in contact if you can remember always that your friend is the expert in their own experience and they dont need you to take over let them know that if they are thinking of leaving they should get in touch with a domestic violence caseworker so they can develop a safety plan lastly dont make your friendship conditional on your friend leaving they may take months or years to leave or they may never leave just let them know you will be there for them no matter what the federal government says it is open to new ideas for reducing violence can you suggest any we need practical action at the coalface that encourages and supports women to seek help keeps them and their children safe and removes the loopholes of impunity for perpetrators if the government wants new ideas here are some bold new strategies proven to reduce domestic abuse here and internationally that we should be seriously considering first the introduction of police stations for women which are solely dedicated to policing family violence and provide a onestop shop for women and children including therapeutic legal and financial help have been proven to reduce domestic homicide in countries across south america and crucially they get women reporting earlier greens codeputy larissa waters is calling for a trial of these womens police stations second we should look very seriously at criminalising coercive control as has been promised by the queensland opposition leader deb frecklington and urged by new south wales mp anna watson criminalising coercive control is not just about locking people up its about changing the paradigm on domestic abuse and requiring police to investigate and report on the entire arc of a relationship instead of isolated incidents globally speaking scotland is seen as the world leader as all of the harms of domestic abuse are included under the one charge third im also a big advocate of localised strategies like focused deterrence and justice reinvestment that develop close and constant collaboration between the community sector domestic abuse substance abuse homelessness and so on and the justice system these strategies break down silos between sector groups that often work at odds with each other they close loopholes in the justice system and they deliver a strong message to perpetrators that unless they accept the help that is on offer and make the rational choice to stop their offending they will feel the full force of the law last fix the family law system the australian law reform commission has delivered a set of reforms that will make children safe implement them what could we do today right now to urgently improve this situation and prevent more murders like this the good news is we know that change is possible here are some critical changes the federal parliament could introduce now to begin with straightaway announce enough secure funding for the womens refuge sector to ensure no woman or child is denied vital protection allocate proper funding for affordable and transitional housing so they can move into homes they can afford reverse funding cuts to community legal aid we just saw in funding removed from victoria legal aid which has cancelled the court network of volunteers who help family violence victims at the family law courts community legal aid is already woefully underfunded there is so much good work already being done if the federal government truly cared about women and childrens safety theyd stop making the womens sector beg and scrape for basic funding in australia if you or someone

the taboo subject of domestic abuse should be brought out into the open and discussed the duchess of cornwall has said before international womens day speaking at the launch of the th annual women of the world wow festival at the southbank centre in central london the duchess said domestic abuse was everyones problem and the solution must be too i find it almost impossible to think that any friend of mine might be living under that horrific threat without my knowing it but that is the power of coercive control and violence in the home it is characterised by silence silence from those that suffer silence from those around them and silence from those who perpetrate abuse this silence is corrosive it leaves women children and men carrying the burden of shame it prevents them from speaking out about the abuse and it prevents them from getting help and at its worst it can be fatal camilla who has been president of wow since said that as well as changing the law talking about the issue was vital in shifting attitudes away from a culture of silence and shame to one where survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame and felt they could get help she said the campaign to end domestic violence needs voices of men as well as women challenging the cultural economic and political context in which we all experience the world we will all benefit from building a society which will simply not tolerate this heinous crime any longer camilla also stressed that domestic violence is a complicated issue that affects men as well as women and that society has a fundamental part to play in changing behaviour we all welcome the new laws on coercive control but laws alone cannot change behaviour she said the dial is moving forward but last year two women a week were killed by a current or former partner in england and wales alone young people she added dont set out to become abusers we need to teach our young men and women what healthy and loving relationships are and that it is never ok to treat anyone with less than respect in the uk one in four women will suffer domestic violence in their lifetime and at least two women are killed each week by current or former partners it is widely hoped that the domestic violence bill will finally pass during this parliament covering a range of issues including banning the crossexamination of victims by their abusers in family courts and requiring tier one local authorities to provide support and ensure safe accommodation for survivors and their children last month the duchess said domestic abuse can affect anybody regardless of social standing or wealth and implored those suffering to seek help nothing makes you immune to domestic abuse happening she said it affects everybody it doesnt matter who you are that would be my message to people whoever you are wherever you are from there are organisations that can help you go and get help talk to them just get up and talk about your experiences they will

domestic abuse in film and television is to be flagged up differently by the british board of film classification the bbfc said it would begin using the term domestic abuse instead of domestic violence in the information it issues to accompany ratings it would also stop using the term themes of because some people felt it trivialised the issue the changes are a response to research carried out with the help of charities womens aid and respect the study suggests the bbfc is making the correct classification decisions on films and tv featuring domestic abuse but too much detail in the information is a minefield as peoples sensitivities and triggers are complex it says for that reason the catchall term of domestic abuse would be used as it is considered broad enough to include psychological and economic abuse gaslighting and non sexual abuse of children the bbfc said the research used a number of case studies for example the bbc drama murdered by my boyfriend which was classified with accompanying information that included strong violence domestic violence theme the rating was broadly agreed with but responses included one from a domestic abuse survivor who said well its not a theme is it if you think through it its real life the research indicates survivors can experience a negative emotional response after watching scenes of domestic abuse especially if it is unexpected this could be traumatising the bbfc said in response it promised to flag up domestic abuse in every case even if the scenes were not category defining david austin the chief executive of the organisation described the research as timely and important it was encouraging to hear that people thought the correct decisions were being made on classifications he said what it has shown is that we should bring our ratings info more in line with what people expect and understand which is exactly what were going to be doing these changes will give people the information they need to choose content well he said most particularly in this case the ratings info will highlight the issues to those that have been personally affected by domestic abuse so they are forewarned of content which could trigger distress adina claire the acting cochief executive of womens aid said this research has given an important insight into what survivors experts and the general public think about depictions of domestic abuse in films and episodic content were pleased that the bbfc has responded to the report and reflected the attitudes in their classification policies meaning that anyone

growing up in a polygamist community shirlee draper heard stories about her fathers childhood how he was pulled out from under his bed in a government raid and taken from his parents i grew up with intense fear of outsiders draper said we called people who drove into town that were not part of our community kidnappers we knew that was a fate we could suffer as our parents had suffered draper was a member of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latterday saints flds a polygamist sect led by warren jeffs who is now in prison for two felony counts of child sexual assault but it wasnt until draper decided to leave that she realized how she had been trapped i saw firsthand how the leaders were able to gain control because of the fear of law enforcement she said in utah polygamy is a felony and it took draper six years to move out i had no way to get help everywhere i went i was visually identifiable as a felon and i was greeted with hostility later when her mother tried to leave the community and apply for a drivers license draper said she was still wearing her flds clothing a collared anklelength dress with puffed sleeves a clerk an employee of the state of utah denied her a drivers license and told her to her face we dont want you here draper said as a result my mom went back to colorado city and she died because she could not access the medical care that she needed draper is now the director of operations for cherish families an organization serving people affected by polygamy what weve done is weve legislated prejudicial treatment to a secondclass citizenry she said lets not create populations and communities that are vulnerable to that kind of exploitation and abuse weve done it to people of color weve done it to sex workers we do it to undocumented immigrants we decide theyre not worthy of living in society and so we ostracize them which practically guarantees that they will be exploited that they will be harmed draper supports a law that would effectively decriminalize polygamy for consenting adults in utah state lawmakers have approved a bill that would reduce the penalties for plural marriage from a felony to an infraction it still needs the governors signature to become law the bills sponsor senator deidre henderson said the fear of government prosecution has created an environment that enables abuse todays prohibition on polygamy has created a shadow society in which the vulnerable make easy prey henderson said because of the very real fear of imprisonment losing employment not being treated fairly and having their children taken into state custody we now have an environment where crime often goes unreported victims are silenced and perpetrators are empowered she said under the bill polygamy is still considered a felony if the person also commits other felony offenses including criminal homicide kidnapping trafficking smuggling sexual offenses or child abuse this bill strikes a balance between giving certainty to otherwise lawabiding polygamists that they dont have to fear prosecution imprisonment or having their children removed simply because they live a polygamous lifestyle while also holding those who commit serious crimes accountable for their actions henderson said utah has had some of the most severe laws on polygamy in the nation it also has the greatest number of people living in plural marriages estimated to be in the thousands though its impossible to get precise numbers because many live in hiding utahs laws governing polygamy can be traced back to its unique history members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints commonly known as mormons once practiced polygamy as part of their religion and fled to the utah territory when they encountered persecution but in order to become a state the federal government required utah to write into its constitution that polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited since the state made polygamy a felony in polygamous families have scattered and formed communities in hiding some as part of religious groups and some independent brenda nicholson is a former member of the same flds sect as shirlee draper but she opposes the move to decriminalize polygamy she believes its not fear of prosecution that isolates people its the control tactics of polygamous leaders themselves they tell you dont trust anything that doesnt come from the church nicholson said men had authority from god they supposedly talked with and for god and so whatever the men said that was it she said people who reported crimes to outside authorities could be expelled punished or separated from family members nicholson was afraid of losing her children not because of the government but because of these male leaders they had gone through a process of deciding who was worthy and who was not worthy three of my children had been judged worthy and i and my husband and our other children were not worthy so they were going to take half my children and give them to a more worthy family nicholson said there was no way i was going to let anybody take my children and so we left nicholson believes more government intervention is needed not less i dont believe that utah really has the intention of truly prosecuting the crimes that are going on theyve had evidence they dont seem to care nicholson said to be told what happened to you wasnt a crime is really hurtful i know there are all these laws around it that apply human trafficking is illegal statutory rape forced marriage child labor physical abuse sexual abuse fraud all of those things are illegal they are very much integrated into religious polygamy people will say we just need to prosecute these other crimes and i agree but the problem is they wont and they arent utah hasnt prosecuted anyone for polygamy in almost two decades instead focusing on crimes such as child sexual assault domestic abuse tax and welfare fraud the state attorney generals office has a written policy of not prosecuting polygamists unless another crime has occurred county attorneys have adopted similar policies some have said the law is unenforceable and possibly unconstitutional joe darger an independent polygamist says court rulings on gay marriage and private homosexual activity have bolstered the case for decriminalization so long as youre not hurting somebody how do you outlaw behavior between consenting adults the difference is polygamists arent trying to get legal recognition darger said its really just freedom to do what you want as a consenting adult he hopes the bill which applies to all genders will help change societal attitudes and separate legitimate criminals from lawabiding polygamists if you want to end the narrative that there are abuses in polygamous communities youve got to take them out of the shadows darger said the majority of them are innocent faithful and civicminded families marginalizing them as committing felonious behavior allows the stereotypes to exist that polygamy equals abuse those kinds of stereotypes exist because no one dares speak up and say anything different he said the law gives people license for bigotry opponents of the bill have questioned whether women raised in isolated religious groups can really be informed consenting adults but shirlee draper finds this insulting nobody would dare infantilize women the way they do women who opt into polygamy draper said from my perspective the most feminist thing we can do is give women the opportunity to choose who they love and with whom they live and thats literally all this bill is doing for my money the more options women have the better access they have to education to healthcare the better choices theyre going to make for themselves she said but as long as we infantilize them and tell them what they can do and what they cant do we remove choices from them as much as they say the polygamists are doing anne wilde is the author of voices in harmony a compilation of womens experiences in plural marriage at years old shes worked for years to educate people about why she and others choose to live in polygamy i have met so many wonderful polygamist families that have no business being labeled as felons wilde said its a shadow over the family because they know and theyve had to teach their children that theyre living that felonious lifestyle she said this kind of removes that shadow but it isnt going to change the opinion of the communities overnight i still believe that polygamy is oppressive to women said mormon feminist lindsay hansen park but she supports the bill we have years of apathy from our state government and law enforcement to prosecute this i found that its nearly impossible to be able to police how relationships work and what a family looks like we need to figure out a better way to get justice for victims who have grown up in isolated fundamentalist groups than attacking family structures she said park is host of the podcast year of polygamy and after talking with victims and advocates she believes this bill removes barriers for people seeking help but its not an easy fixall she said it doesnt bring justice to a lot of victims who leave these groups and dont have any retribution for the things that they went through im convinced that polygamy is a symptom of the problem but its not the problem itself park said the problem is patriarchal hierarchy with religious penalties that takes a lot more to dismantle than a piece of legislation,2020-03,growing polygamist

children and migrant women are being overlooked by new laws designed to protect victims and punish perpetrators of domestic violence charities have said the longawaited domestic abuse bill will be introduced in the house of commons on tuesday for its first reading it was delayed by boris johnsons decision to prorogue parliament and hold an election last year further to the legislation the government has started a review into what support can be provided to migrant victims of domestic abuse the legislation has been broadly welcomed by womens rights campaigners and domestic abuse charities however some groups are concerned the laws do not go far enough to help children as well as migrant or black asian and minority ethnic bame women the step up migrant women coalition comprising more than bame specialist frontline services and migrant and human rights organisations welcomed the bill but said it risked leaving behind migrant and bame women who have been abused they said abused women with insecure immigration status often did not seek help from the police for fear of being reported to the home office and detained deported or made destitute migrant women they added were predominantly barred from refuges and denied a safe place to sleep because they did not have access to public funds gisela valle the director of the latin american womens rights service said by neglecting to address the barriers experienced by migrant victims the bill falls short of realising the governments stated goals of protecting victims and tackling crime all victims regardless of their immigration status must be able to report to the police safely and without fear otherwise they cannot be protected and their abusers will not be held accountable we are disappointed that migrant survivors are once again overlooked in this bill in spite of the recommendations made last year by the parliamentary joint committee on the draft domestic abuse bill to establish a firewall to separate reporting of a crime and access to support from immigration control marchu girma the deputy director of women for refugee women said women with insecure immigration status are more vulnerable to abuse and yet they are unable to report violence and seek justice without fear because there is currently no separation of immigration enforcement from police response to victims of crime she said the bill should ensure all women including migrant women are able to report safely and are protected when they report abuse and not penalised because of their immigration status the government described the latest bill as the most comprehensive package ever to tackle this horrendous crime saying the enhanced proposals would go even further to support and protect victims and punish perpetrators and had been widely supported by charities mps and law enforcement action for children estimates tens of thousands of children have been at risk of domestic abuse since the general election the charitys director of policy and campaigns imran hussain said it was vital the bill recognised a child as an innocent victim and not just a witness emily hilton a senior policy officer at the nspcc said the government was missing a landmark opportunity to make a difference adding it is extremely disappointing that the bill in its current form fails to protect children from the

the government is examining what can be done to stop the use of the rough sex defence in courts to escape justice officials have said as a longawaited domestic abuse bill finally returns to parliament the latest version of the bill is due to have its first reading in the house of commons after it was stalled when boris johnson prorogued parliament and the general election was called announcing its return to parliament the home office said the government was considering how it could curb use of the defence most recently highlighted during the trial of the killer of the british backpacker grace millane in new zealand in that case the murderers defence counsel argued that millane from essex died accidentally in a tragic event that resulted from a toxic combination of alcohol inexperience with bdsm practices and sexual passion going too far in the wake of the killers conviction the campaign group we cant consent to this revealed that in the past decade women and girls had been killed in what was claimed to have been consensual violent sexual activity in the uk senior lawyers and womens organisations called for a change to the law in the uk the domestic abuse bill looks broadly the same as before and still includes plans to force domestic abusers to take polygraph tests commonly referred to as lie detectors similar to ideas mooted for monitoring terrorists if the bill becomes law a threeyear pilot will be carried out on domestic abusers deemed at high risk of causing serious harm if successful the tests would be rolled out nationwide among other proposals the legislation pledges to ban perpetrators from crossexamining their victims during family court proceedings and could require councils to find safe accommodation for victims and their children a measure the charity womens aid said could be lifesaving but the charity crisis said this would not ensure victims fleeing domestic abuse had a legal right to safe permanent housing and could put them at risk of spending years in temporary accommodation court protection orders that ban perpetrators from contacting a victim or force them to take part in alcohol or drug treatment programmes could also be introduced under the laws police costs for bringing the orders to court would be paid for by the government for two years while a pilot of the scheme took place a definition of domestic abuse would be set that recognises economic abuse when a perpetrator controls a victims finances as a specific type of the crime it would also acknowledge the use of technology to target a victim last year nicole jacobs was appointed as the first domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales the independent office of the domestic abuse commissioner which is still being set up will be made a statutory body and publish reports on its findings jacobs will be considering how the government can support children affected by domestic abuse the home office said of the deaths linked to rough sex in the last decade resulted in men being convicted of murder nine led to manslaughter convictions and two ended in acquittals a further case ended in a murder conviction but only after the victims husband confessed police had initially treated the death as nonsuspicious the case of one womans death has yet to go to court in there were two cases in which deaths and injuries to women were blamed on rough sex a figure that

refuges providing sanctuary to victims of domestic violence are running out of space with many full or effectively closed amid an epidemic inside this pandemic the victims commissioner has told mps a perfect storm of problems is in danger of overwhelming support services for those trying to escape violent and abusive partners dame vera baird qc warned members of the house of commons justice select committee she also said on tuesday there was evidence of a newer trend of older children principally teenagers attacking their parents amid frustration about being unable to go outside the former solicitor general reinforced concerns about the rapid rise in domestic violence cases during lockdown earlier this month she warned that domestic abuse killings were up to twice as high as normal since lockdown measures confined millions of people to their homes although the sample size was small there was always going to be an epidemic of domestic violence inside this pandemic baird said it should have been flagged up a lot earlier there have been stories from social services of people not being able to obtain admission to family homes to investigate because they have been told inappropriately they havent got personal protective equipment ppe ministers are working very hard but they are all working in their own silos its imperative that there be more accommodation made available for victims of domestic violence refuges are full others are in lockdown because of coronavirus so cant take in new victims there were refuge vacancies in england on april compared to on the same day last year the womens aid annual survey carried out on a single day found there were women with children and young people staying in refuges across all services in england theres very little accommodation baird said universities and hotels have been offering help but they cannot provide the specialist services required she added an intergovernmental group involving both the ministry of justice and home office should be established to deal with the problem baird urged with the victims commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner also involved a survey published by womens aid on tuesday found that over twothirds of survivors contacted this month said that domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown said their abuser has more control over their life since covid over threequarters of victims the survey found reported that covid has made it harder for them to leave their abuser one survivor said i wanted to leave the relationship however since covid and the lockdown coming into effect it has made it harder to leave i am a key worker who is around covid positive patients so i dont feel like i can go home and stay with my parents womens aid said there was a severe shortage of refuge places even before the pandemic there were about refuges in england and wales in but funding has been cut lucy hadley campaigns and policy manager at womens aid said demand for refuge services far outstripped supply before the covid crisis sixtyfour per cent of refuge referrals were declined in and the number of refuge bed spaces in england is below the number recommended by the council of europe these lifesaving services are now on the frontline of the response to the pandemic they are now facing staff shortages lost income challenges in managing social distancing within communal accommodation and restrictions on resettling women and children into longterm housing this simply means the spaces we have are even less accessible to survivors baird also told the justice committee that there is some suggestion of abuse by older children on parents during the coronavirus lockdown this is a newer kind of domestic abuse which is probably suggestive of kids wanting to go out and not being allowed to we are talking teenagers calls to domestic violence helplines have rocketed she said although complaints to the police have not gone up commensurately there are real worries about access to any help if you are locked down with the perpetrator in the next room labours shadow home secretary nick thomassymonds mp has criticised the governments

mps have demanded an urgent crossgovernment action plan on how to tackle increasing levels of domestic abuse under the lockdown warning that without intervention society will be dealing with the devastating consequences for a generation in a report published on monday the home affairs select committee calls for a raft of measures from the government including an emergency package of funding for support services for domestic abuse victims and vulnerable children the crossparty committee recommends that the government legislates to remove a time limit on prosecuting certain offences to ensure perpetrators of domestic abuse during the lockdown do not get away with their crimes the government should sponsor the broadening of a safe spaces model to allow victims to access support via supermarkets and other retailers it adds multiple support services have reported a surge in calls to helplines while the metropolitan police said they had made arrests for domestic abuse offences an average of about a day since march when people with coronavirus symptoms were asked to selfisolate the domestic abuse bill returns to the commons for its second reading on tuesday the committees chair yvette cooper said staying at home is an important part of the strategy to prevent coronavirus from spreading and save lives but for some people home isnt safe urgent action is needed to protect victims and prevent perpetrators from exploiting the lockdown to increase abuse there are already alarming signs of the rise in domestic abuse our crossparty committee is calling for an urgent action plan from government setting out practical measures to tackle domestic abuse as an integrated part of the fight against covid we are calling for new emergency funding for support services new ways for victims to access help through supermarkets and pharmacies outreach visits to known vulnerable households support for children and a new guarantee of safe housing for anyone needing to leave their home during lockdown because of abuse she added things are particularly hard for vulnerable children we cant abandon them in the middle of this crisis local authorities schools the police and other professionals involved in child welfare need to ensure they are working together to contact and visit homes where children are at risk this isnt just about supporting victims in periods of lockdown when restrictions are eased and victims try to leave or to return to normal life the threat to them could be even greater and the need for support will be acute the emotional physical and social scars from domestic abuse can last a lifetime if we dont act to tackle it now we will feel the consequences of rising abuse during the coronavirus crisis for many years to come a pioneering project called counting dead women has recorded at least domestic abuse killings of women and children between march when the lockdown began and april while the committee welcomed a public information campaign launched by the government this month the report says ministers need to go further with a full action plan led and coordinated by the home secretary priti patel a crossgovernment strategy would need to cover support services housing and the criminal justice system the report says and should extend to the period immediately after the lockdown is lifted when the need for assistance is likely to be acute without strong action to tackle domestic abuse and support victims during the covid pandemic society will be dealing with the devastating consequences for a generation the report says it says the plan should include access to information and support prevention and outreach housing support and refuge accommodation as well as a strong criminal justice response in particular it says support services for domestic abuse and vulnerable children need urgent and direct funding otherwise victims will be put at much greater risk of harm it urges ministers to set up an emergency funding package ringfenced within the m fund that the government has promised for charities dealing with the coronavirus crisis the home secretary previously announced m of funding for domestic abuse helplines and online support while of funding will go to six charities that specialise in supporting victims of domestic and sexual abuse the safeguarding minister victoria atkins said the government has prioritised those at risk of domestic abuse in this national health emergency this has included a dedicated national campaign to provide practical help to victims and supporting charities by giving them the funding and the resources they specifically said they needed to help people through this crisis we are taking action across government alongside the youarenotalone campaign we are increasing funding to boost online services helplines and technology support at the request of charities and i am working with the domestic abuse commissioner about how they can use the governments m fund to

social distancing is saving lives every day but the physical and psychological toll of the lockdown is not spread evenly among us care home residents prisoners and children in the care of the state are just some of those whose health and wellbeing have been disproportionately endangered for the common good and the enforced social isolation of a lockdown is a particularly terrifying prospect for victims of domestic abuse and their offspring abusers so often rely on isolating their victims from friends family and colleagues in order to prolong and worsen the impact of their abuse the lockdown has aided and abetted them in their mission to terrorise around of adults report having experienced domestic abuse in the last year the overwhelming majority of them women two women a week are killed by a current or former partner since social distancing restrictions came into force last month there are alarming signs that domestic abuse has surged the national domestic abuse helpline has seen a increase in calls and the metropolitan police have reported a increase in charges and cautions for domestic abuse the pandemic also makes it more difficult for women to access help not just because they may be constantly monitored at home but because three quarters of domestic abuse services have reported having to reduce their services because of staff selfisolating and social distancing requirements this week the longdelayed domestic abuse bill will return to parliament for its second reading it comprises some welcome measures including the creation of a statutory definition of domestic abuse which includes emotional coercive and economic abuse as well as physical violence and the legal establishment of a domestic abuse commissioner but it goes nowhere near far enough in tackling the hurt that is going on behind closed doors the nature of domestic abuse means that properly addressing and preventing it is relatively resource intensive it is not simply a matter of removing a woman and her children from an unsafe situation domestic abuse survivors need ongoing support first to be able to leave their abuser and then to process the trauma that years of damage can inflict evidencebased perpetrator programmes are required to reduce the risk of them reoffending either with their former partner or a new one none of that comes cheap yet the bill provides nowhere near the level of resourcing that is needed to keep women safe like all locally funded services those for domestic abuse have faced significant funding cuts over the last decade the extra funding announced by government in february for refuge services will not fill the gap the number of refuge spaces in the uk is almost a third lower than that recommended by the council of europe and there has been no extra funding allocated for community services which are accessed by most domestic abuse survivors while the legislation would give the police greater powers to enforce domestic abuse protection orders the government is planning no resources or training for already stretched law forces the bill also does nothing to recognise that the government is complicit in the abuse of migrant women through its hostile environment policies many have no recourse to public funds and so are unable to access statutory support leaving them trapped in lifethreatening situations abused women whose migrant status is insecure are put off from seeking help from the police because it can result in their deportation and separation from their children too often abusers know this and use it as yet another weapon of intimidation all victims of domestic abuse and their children should be entitled to support regardless of their immigration status the cost of properly resourcing domestic abuse services pales in comparison to its huge societal cost which the government estimates at bn a year it is small change compared with the vast sums that have been rightly found to protect the economy

alison young lived in lockdown long before covid for most of her eightyear marriage her controlling husband only allowed her to leave the house for authorised trips that was invariably food shopping and when i got back he always checked the receipts the mileage and searched the car for crumbs in case id eaten when i was out which i wasnt allowed to do she says if you bent the rules or argued back you didnt know how hed react sometimes hed let me laugh it off other times hed have a knife at my throat so the fear never left it was either just under the surface or spilling out of every pore in the first four weeks of lockdown in the uk women and four children are believed to have been killed by men most while shut inside their homes thats double the already mindbending average of two women a week at the same time womens frontline services are reporting recordbreaking cries for help calls to domestic violence helplines have increased by while traffic to their websites is tripling theres an unprecedented demand for refuge places children too are more vulnerable than they have ever been some social services have reported that before the easter holidays the number of atrisk children who have been allocated a school place actually turning up to school had dropped to below in certain schools it had fallen to zero ive been reading the reports about these lockdown murders and women desperately needing help and its always depicted as people living under pressure in extraordinary times and losing the plot says young who now runs an unofficial support network for women like her when youre living it its not like that at all its about how abusive partners behave when theres no public scrutiny when everyones looking the other way its about someone using every change in circumstance for leverage and adapting to every new way of living by massively tightening control dr jane moncktonsmith a former police officer and forensic criminologist at the university of gloucester spent years studying hundreds of intimate partner homicides interviewing families and public protection professionals in order to plot the slow creep from first meet to murder last year she published the homicide timeline which identified eight stages that killers pass through the first is a prerelationship history of stalking domestic violence or coercive control the second is declaring love and moving the relationship forward very quickly third is a tightening of control this could be rules about a partners spending habits the friends she sees the clothes she wears before lockdown most controlling people were at stage three says monktonsmith stage four on her scale is a trigger event something that threatens the killers sense of power and control often its their partner leaving the relationship but it could be so many other things retirement or unemployment illness a new baby or lockdown all our abusers are now in stage four says moncktonsmith whoever you are covid has taken your control away youve lost control of where you can go what you can do you might have lost control of your finances if youre with children hours a day and theyre too noisy too messy if your victim gets ill or isnt able to keep the children and the house the way you want it she says im not saying that everyone at this stage will move to homicide but every abuser is now more volatile and higher risk and if that person is impulsive or comfortable with violence it can pass through the next stages escalation a change in thinking planning and homicide very quickly young recognises this pattern all too well for her the trigger event was losing her job it was through no fault of my own there was a restructuring and my job didnt exist any more she says i remember sitting on the train home after i had been told so frightened i could barely see it was terrifying i knew i had to tell him and i knew i was in for it i had a wellpaid job and he didnt work so he needed me to he took my bank card i wasnt allowed to go anywhere because according to him every time i left the house it would cost money living together in their own personal lockdown youngs partner became more violent and less predictable it escalated really quickly she says he threatened me with knives and ive been raped many times it was after her partner pulled her from her bed as she slept to drag her around the room like a rag doll that young turned to a friend who helped her escape for laura camm the trigger event was the birth of their daughter when she arrived he wasnt the most important person any more camm says he could see i was weak and tired and overweight he bought a running machine put it in the middle of the living room and had a go at me when i wasnt on it the abuse escalated really quickly he started strangling me whenever we had an argument he strangled me to the point of unconsciousness although camm managed to end the relationship and keep her house her partners behaviour has again escalated since lockdown i have a health condition that puts me at higher risk of covid i have an nhs letter identifying me as a shielded patient so ive had to stop my daughter from seeing him she says i dont trust him to keep to social distancing rules or to bring her back to me he has a record of not keeping to the arrangements and its usually me that has to go out and do the running around he is sending me hundreds of abusive texts threatening me with police and social services and telling me hes going for full custody a few days before lockdown my parents put a doorbell with a camera on it on to my front door and the first person we saw on it that day while i was at work was him right now he knows where i am and i dont feel safe natalie page founder of the court said which supports survivors of abuse who are fighting over access custody and finances in the family courts says that lockdown has piled on another layer of risk ive been contacted by women whose former partners havent returned the children since lockdown started she says or women whose former partners are using the opportunity to intimidate them threaten them take long walks past their houses because they know that women are alone and vulnerable and normal rules dont really apply against all this of womens frontline support is reporting a reduced service because of less facetoface contact as well as staff sickness and technical issues including a basic lack of laptops to enable working from home the home offices recent pledge of m for domestic abuse services will help although it has been heavily criticised as nowhere near enough the mp jess phillips alongside campaigning groups such as southall black sisters have enlisted hotels to open their doors to women urgently needing to flee abuse the next stage is for the government to underwrite the cost however suzanne jacob the ceo of the uk charity safelives believes the priority should be removing the perpetrators the victim shouldnt have to leave the home especially now in a pandemic she says one thing police are asking for is a relaxation in rules around domestic violence protection orders which allow them to remove perpetrators for a very limited period and also a relaxation in rules about how long people can be kept in custody this has already happened in other countries including italy the womens equality party has also called for special police powers to evict perpetrators of domestic violence in lockdown moncktonsmith points to the irish response where police are checking in on previous victims sending a clear message to households they know to be high risk for women living in lockdown in fear there is a great deal of information on the internet womens aid has a page dedicated to safely covering your tracks when searching online for information refuge now has a webform which allows a woman to set up a safe time to receive a call if they have one every woman should know about the silent call service says moncktonsmith if you call and cant talk press twice and the police will act on it for the rest of us she says be alert if you do know someone who is suffering have a secret code system something they can say if theyre frightened like i need a pint of milk shop assistants postal workers and delivery drivers should also be aware that now that gps surgeries are hard to access and schools are closed they might be a victims only point of contact if someone looks like theyre pleading but cant say anything if they pass you a note please act on it she adds dont intervene

at least suspected domestic abuse killings in the uk have been identified by campaigners since the covid lockdown restrictions were imposed far higher than the average rate for the time of year it has emerged karen ingala smith the founder of counting dead women a pioneering project that records the killing of women by men in the uk has identified at least killings between march and april including those of children looking at the same period over the last years smiths data records an average of five deaths her findings for which are collated from internet searches and people contacting over social media were raised during evidence to the home affairs select ommittee on wednesday dame vera baird qc the victims commissioner for england and wales told mps at the remote session counting dead women has got to a total of domestic abuse killings in the last three weeks we usually say there are two a week that looks to me like five a week thats the size of this crisis a number of domestic abuse charities and campaigners have reported a surge in calls to helplines and online services since the lockdown conditions were imposed reflecting experiences in other countries smith who is also chief executive of a domestic abuse charity said i dont believe coronavirus creates violent men what were seeing is a window into the levels of abuse that women live with all the time coronavirus may exacerbate triggers though i might prefer to call them excuses lockdown may restrict some womens access to support or escape and it may even curtail measures some men take to keep their own violence under control we have to be cautious about how we talk about increases in men killing women over the last years in the uk a woman has been killed by a man every three days by a partner or expartner every four days so if this was averaged out we might expect to see seven women killed in days in reality there are always times when the numbers are higher or lower but we can say that the number of women killed by men over the first three weeks since lockdown is the highest its been for at least years and is double that of an average days over the last years smiths research shows at least seven people have been allegedly killed by partners or former partners during the period while three people have been allegedly killed by their father the committee also heard evidence from nicole jacobs the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales she said time limits on investigating crimes would need to be relaxed to allow survivors of violence in the home to report perpetrators once the coronavirus restrictions were eased i have heard from police about the need to extend the time by which people can report crimes there are people who are experiencing abuse right now who arent able to call the police because it wouldnt be safe for them said jacobs but they may well want to report a crime later so we need to allow for some extension to what the normal timescales would be for that kind of thing crimes that are summary only which means that they can only be tried at a magistrates court including common assault and harassment must be prosecuted within six months jacobs said services must prepare for the inevitable surge of domestic abuse victims seeking support when the lockdown lifts she said there were concerns that some of the millions of pounds of government funding announced for the charity sector may struggle to reach small local charities that supported specific groups we need to allow those charities to quickly and very simply bid in and get the funds they need to sustain what they are doing but also plan for the inevitable surge that we will havethere will be people that are waiting and trying to survive every day and then will access support as quickly as they can when some of the lockdown is lifted she told mps in the uk call the national domestic abuse helpline on or visit womens aid in australia the national family violence counselling

fiona dwyer the chief executive of solace womens aid the capitals largest provider of domestic abuse services sounds incredulous at the inadequacy of the advice coming from the government priti patel saying that victims of domestic abuse dont have to stay in the house they can just leave shows she has no understanding of the dynamics of domestic abuse and no interest in it either says dwyer over the weekend the home secretary announced a campaign of support for domestic abuse victims that involves people drawing a heart on their hand plus m for the sector the need could not be more urgent according to the counting dead women campaign since lockdown on march at least women and children have been killed by men they knew six more killings of women by men in that period are yet to be confirmed as domestic homicides as well as domestic homicides dwyer warns that what were also going to see is an increase in suicides people who really want to flee but cant and feel they have no other choice solaces refuges across the capital are now completely full and because nobody can move on from the spaces none of its selfcontained units are coming free so will the extra m from the government be enough for any individual charity focusing on violence against women and girls that amount would be huge because we run things on a shoestring dwyer replies spread across the whole country its pitiful she thinks the money will mainly be spent on the national domestic abuse helpline which refers women on to organisations like solace to provide a roof over victims heads regarding accommodation weve sent numerous letters to various secretaries of state including priti patel and had no response to any of them she says we welcome the inclusion of tackling perpetrators in her announcement suggesting that they should be the ones to leave and would like to see how the home secretary plans to put this into practice in the meantime we are still funding accommodation from our emergency appeal for those women and children who have managed to flee since the lockdown began solace has had to pay for emergency accommodation for women who have fled their homes including a heavily pregnant muslim woman with three children who was turned away for help by a council housing department it wouldnt step in because the government advice has been that nobody should move so housing officers are interpreting that as everyone should go home dwyer explains its a madness and its really terrifying us that we are still seeing people turned away at this time all her organisations facetoface support to help traumatised victims make safety plans or organise the best way to flee has had to go online unplanned spending on tablets laptops and other communications tech for solaces support workers to keep in touch with clients has been expensive the charity which has an annual income of just under m is burning through money it has not budgeted for solace and the public interest law centre wrote a letter last month asking the government to provide emergency funding for domestic abuse organisations during the pandemic right now we need money if we dont get that funding more people will die she says dwyer is trying to anticipate the level of funding needed both now but also after the crisis when she expects services to be inundated even in the healthiest relationship being cooped up is extra pressure weve now got a situation where perpetrators may never have worked from home and end up becoming even more abusive then if youve got someone using it as an opportunity to further isolate you saying we need to selfisolate we cant go out well its really difficult and we dont know how long this will go on for victims only have bad options she points out either you leave and become homeless or you end up sleeping somewhere really unsafe or you stay at home and risk your life and as the risks soar for victims so too does the pressure on staff at domestic abuse charities they are now cleaning refuges daily but have not been able to access personal protective equipment ppe despite a number of suspected covid cases whole houses have had to selfisolate but they have not been tested despite some people being very unwell says dwyer solace is now having to deliver food to its refuges that are in complete lockdown and there have also been suspected covid cases among employees which she explains has had an impact on staffing levels and heightened the anxiety of the workforce we have developed a redeployment list so that staff from other services are supporting each other says dwyer all senior managers have also volunteered themselves for the list yes im really stressed because its stressful she adds we have amazingly resilient staff and working through it all together has been great but what we want is to be able to continue to support our services thats the biggest thing my concern as well is for the wider sector because we know the smaller specialist organisations will be completely drowning at the moment of course it doesnt help that domestic violence services have been slashed since although the domestic violence bill introduced by theresa mays government is seen as a big step forward it looks unlikely to be passed any time soon and none of the m pledged by the government earlier this year to help fund domestic abuse refuges has yet reached those providing services and while dwyer welcomes the creation of the first domestic violence commissioner nicole jacobs she says on its own its not enough she insists that the government and society need to take domestic abuse more seriously its become normalised for a lot of people its become seen as inevitable says dwyer but its not curriculum vitae age lives

chilling figures that show a surge in domestic abuse are beginning to emerge as couples spend enforced time in their homes together during the covid lockdown ten women were killed by men five of the victims were within married couples in the uk between march when government lockdown restrictions began and april the national domestic abuse hotline run by charity refuge reported a increase in calls in the same period and between march and april womens aid experienced a increase in users visiting its live chat site compared to the previous week i fear that these statistics will tragically worsen over the coming weeks as more and more women suffer increased levels of abuse at the hands of their partners i know from personal experience what it is like to live like this and the prospect of doing so is unimaginable with potentially devastating consequences for thousands of women within weeks of me saying my marriage vows and having a simple band of gold slipped on to my finger my life became more complicated lovingly prepared homecooked dinners were angrily rejected by my new husband because i hadnt predicted his preferred meal that day id dress for a night out and be told he didnt like my choice of outfit phone calls to old friends began to feel uncomfortable as he lurked nearby monitoring my conversations i naively accepted these foibles as the reality of married life the human flaws surfacing after the veneer of dating falls away in reality what i was experiencing i recognised many years later was coercive control since december this emotional and mental manipulation of someone in an intimate relationship has been formally recognised in criminal law as a corrosive form of domestic abuse and often as it was for me too a precursor and adjunct to physical violence gradually he chipped away artfully alienating my small circle of friends manipulating me to his moulded vision of wifely submission undermining all my independent decisions actions or emotions after a while weary of the daily commute and perhaps subliminally hoping that i might restore some of the magic in our relationship i began to work for myself from a desk in the spare room of our cottage but my newfound liberation from corporate life had the opposite effect on my domestic life i became a prisoner in my own home answerable not to a boss but to an increasingly demanding husband fuelled by spiralling alcohol consumption that made him more volatile than ever the slightest thing might trigger his rage leaving me in a state of heightened alert in his presence it was no longer a jibe or the silent treatment that came when i made the mistake of occupying the bathroom if he wanted to shower but an angry fist punched through the ceiling or a hand around my neck pinning me to the cold tiled wall my feet hovering inches from the floor the stench of alcohol on his breath that accompanied a slightly maniacal glint in his eyes meant i knew i was likely to wake the next morning with a tender dark purple patch somewhere on my body i took to wearing rollnecks and scarves even on warmer days and was using concealer in industrial quantities my wrists were often red raw from his vicelike grip and my eyes were pink and puffy from the constant crying sunglasses became an essential accessory i lost count of the vases and pieces of crockery that met their end after violent contact with the wall or floor i began to fear i might suffer the same fate the darkest days came when the violence wasnt merely a shove a slap or even semistrangulation but brutal demanding agonising sex against my will that left me gasping and streaming tears into a pillow that i wished would suffocate me it was of course rape even between spouses nonconsensual sex is a traumatic assault no less of a crime than a harrowing attack on a stranger after increasingly turbulent years my living hell ended in a court injunction and a prolonged acrimonious divorce the wounds have healed but the scars will always remain today i fear for the millions of vulnerable women and men around the world who will struggle to escape abusive partners compared to just over three on average over the same period in each of

actually in difficult times we dont want situations to escalate a lot of the resources we have available will be about helping people to deescalate difficult situations and manage themselves in a crisis callers are more concerned about being indoors more and worried about not being able to control their own behaviour and feeling quite hopeless and helpless as there are more limitations on the other services they can get to which increases anxiety even more kirkpatrick said the charitys member organisations that work with perpetrators are having to move to non facetoface work some domestic

department and those across government can ensure that this additional investment is made available as soon as possible and also in ensuring that organisations operating on the frontline are given the necessary financial flexibility in order to ensure that they can make best use of the available funds it is important they are not unduly burdened by reporting restrictions whilst of course ensuring

equipment and covid testing thomassymonds asks for increased public messaging through supermarkets pharmacies and other appropriate areas to provide information on the means by which victims can signal the need for urgent police help he adds we are seeing initiatives such as these being coordinated in some areas of the country but such is the scale of the risk and challenge it is vital that government step in to provide additional leadership in this area some of the most at risk people in our communities simply cannot afford for these vital services to be undermined at a time when they

for most of us the announcement of the lockdown last month was a sober even daunting moment it is hard to imagine how terrifying it must have been for those who knew they would now be confined with their abusers as the un secretary general antnio guterres warned on monday the threat for many women and girls looms largest where they should be safe in their own homes the warning was first sounded in wuhan where activists reported that domestic violence rates were soaring due to the lockdown since then around the world orders to stay at home have made many victims more vulnerable the cause of domestic abuse is the perpetrator not coronavirus but rates of violence increase in many emergencies and this crisis is doubly perilous because it is simultaneously closing routes to safety one of the most chilling reports is that calls to helplines in italy have actually dropped while text messages and emails have increased from women who do not dare to ring while their abuser is close by in the uk the national domestic abuse helpline has recorded a increase in calls and online requests for help since the lockdown began visits to its website are higher than in the last week of february children too are vulnerable while those with a social worker are still attending school the easter holidays have now begun and other children will no longer have the opportunity to access support at school mr guterres has rightly urged all governments to make preventing violence against women a key part of their covid response in the uk organisations that deliver services to those affected have warned the government that action is needed now austerity has already had a punitive effect on the sector now police health services and local authorities as well as refuges and support groups are under new pressure from the combined effect of additional demands and reduced resources due to illness and selfisolation smaller organisations in particular face huge financial pressure cash is urgently needed to support and bolster current work and address new needs for example moving services online where possible for groups helping victims and those such as respect which works with perpetrators looking for help to stop womens aid has also asked for protective clothing for workers and testing in refuges in scotland nicola sturgeon has already announced that she is increasing funding to scottish womens aid and rape crisis scotland ministers should also stress that victims need not wait to seek help while reinforcing the importance of the lockdown in general they must say loud and clear that people should leave home if they need to do so for their safety and remind them that services are still open they should also publicise helpline numbers and websites and remind those in danger that they can call and simply press when prompted so that they do not risk being overheard like the lockdown itself these could be lifesaving measures in the uk visit or call hours or

domestic abuse survivors have been told they must appear in person to give evidence to mps despite raising concerns about coronavirus infection risks the requirement has raised criticism from charities and campaigning groups eighteen domestic abuse and womens rights groups including womens aid refuge and amnesty international have written to the leader of the house of commons jacob reesmogg to say it is unacceptable to require survivors of domestic abuse to attend parliament in person socalled hybrid parliament arrangements allowing individuals to provide evidence to scrutiny committees via video link are set to end next week after a decision by reesmogg at least three women who have experienced domestic abuse are to give evidence on june to the public bill committee for the domestic abuse bill a longawaited piece of legislation going through parliament the role of the committee made up of mps including ministers is to scrutinise the legislation line by line nicki norman the acting cochief executive of womens aid said we welcome the public bill committees decision to hear the expert evidence of domestic abuse survivors as they scrutinise the landmark domestic abuse bill however it is clearly wrong to require them to give evidence in person this requirement is unsafe for survivors especially for women from black and minority ethnic communities and those with disabilities it will put survivors and staff supporting them at risk and force them to breach current government guidance the government must urgently reconsider this requirement we also urge the bill committee to make time to hear from a wide range of organisations working to end domestic abuse including organisations supporting marginalised survivors whose voices are often unheard other signatories to the letter include the end violence against women coalition respect safelives and rape crisis england and wales a government spokesperson said the landmark domestic abuse bill will transform the way we support victims and tackle perpetrators the government is committed to ensuring the house of commons has the opportunity to hear from survivors and we are looking at options to facilitate remote participation for those in unique circumstances so their voices are heard and they can continue to contribute to the bill a commons spokesperson said the scheduling of legislation in the commons is a matter for the government staff have been drawing up plans for socially distanced physical public bill committee meetings work is being undertaken to enable such committees to take evidence remotely from midjune the domestic abuse bill includes plans to force domestic abusers to take polygraph tests commonly referred to as lie detectors among other proposals the legislation

the surge in recorded domestic violence in recent weeks poses a big challenge to the uplifting messages about human nature now associated with the work of star author rutger bregman but the bestselling dutch historian offered some responses to the grim trend this weekend in a hay festival conversation with the writer actor and model lily cole admitting that his latest book humankind should have included more analysis of the destructive forces behind domestic violence bregman told cole that since its publication and even more since the imposition of an international lockdown he has thought hard about the issue ive been thinking that school or certainly the traditional english public school model is like a prison in that you cant get out and it is hierarchical as a result they have a lot of bullying on the other hand if you mix ages and academic ability this is less of a problem said bregman and i wonder is the classic household setup similar to a strict school with its inequalities in reply cole who has her own positive book on human behaviour who cares wins about the potential for a gift economy out in the summer noted that some anthropological studies have suggested that nomadic tribes show less evidence of domestic abuse and it is the privacy and isolation afforded by a closed domestic setting that can allow abuse to develop unchecked bregmans earlier book utopia for realists coupled with a talk he gave at davos about taxes in which went viral have made him popular internationally particularly with those trying to shape a more positive narrative for human societies of the future the digital hay festival event was watched by fans from around the world bregman said he hoped the pandemic may now allow for societies to change to me the message of my book feels quite timely the first chapter is about how people respond in a crisis but we actually have an extraordinary amount of evidence showing that you get an explosion of altruism he said even before this in the past years so many ideas that were once dismissed have become quite mainstream the tide is really turning cynicism is out bregman also said he hopes to break down the old binary oppositions between left and right capitalism and communism and state and the market to create a possible third way that is closer to anarchism it is not tony blairs third way he said telling cole he is attempting to reclaim two historically stigmatised terms not just anarchism but communism and take them back to their original meanings when i talk about everyday communism i am teasing a little it is a provocative idea but then we all do a lot of sharing a lot of the time we dont draw up contracts for everything it would be impossible on top of all that interaction we have put the market and

annie had endured two years of domestic abuse when the coronavirus lockdown restrictions were imposed it was at this moment she finally started to believe her partner would kill her you cant go out with anyone theres no way to get away from it youre stuck with it hours she said but the intensity of the lockdown prompted annie to take a crucial step she resolved to flee her home and seek shelter in a womens refuge annie was taken into one of refuges run by the charity hestia across london boroughs while the experience has been lifechanging for her the covid crisis has thrown up new challenges for those living in protected accommodation as well as the staff who are risking the virus to keep the services running through interviews and diary extracts annie and two women in the reigate and banstead womens aid refuge in surrey have provided the guardian with unique insight into life there in the time of covid i was concerned about coming to the refuge anyone would be but if you know that youre going to be able to get far far away then its worth it annie said so you just have to go through all your fears and break them down a little bit rebecca who is pregnant and has children found the first few weeks of lockdown hard im trying to come to terms with the news of a lockdown the virus being pregnant and in a refuge with other families that i have no control over how they should keep up with hygiene she wrote in her diary so many fears and questions linger in my mind how will we share the toilets we are told that if one of us gets sick they will use the toilet and the shower downstairs and that is where my room is rebecca explains she and the other tenants agree to a cleaning rota to allow some social distancing sharing the communal areas is becoming a sort of nightmare because you dont know if the people here have the virus or not she wrote i keep to my room as i consider myself a high risk i am very anxious and worried when my kids go out to the back garden and interact with other children rebecca is a migrant and has to apply for a destitution domestic violence concession allowing her to claim public funds while applying to settle in the uk she found the challenges of homeschooling in a new environment difficult i now have to be a teacher to my kids and make sure they complete school work she wrote they are feeling disappointed but at least the whole country is on lockdown not just us so it doesnt make us feel disadvantaged i try as much as i can to assure them other children knock on the door in the refuge which makes her anxious she wants her children to feel at home but she is concerned about the virus i live in fear of the unknown she wrote the women may feel anxious about the virus in the refuge but the staff are working hard to ensure they are in a safe environment charlotte kneer the chief executive of the reigate and banstead womens aid refuge and a survivor of abuse said the big worry is its a communal living environment in the same way as nurseries if one gets a bug it goes through the whole place its the same for us we have women children in a small space where theyre sharing facilities were trying to make sure that every day theres enough cleaning stuff im worried that if someone gets it theyre all going to get it we have a plan that if someone has it or suspects they have it theres a bathroom only they and their children use only come out and use the kitchen when no one else is around kneers refuge can house up to vulnerable women and children at a time it offers clean furnished rooms with televisions and teamaking facilities a communal living area and kitchen and a large garden with playground equipment one member of staff is on site every day to hand out rations of food and toiletries multiple support services have seen a surge in calls to helplines during the lockdown period but there are fears that the already creaking refuge system in england and wales will not be able to cope with the number of women looking to flee abuse sally also a mother said the lockdown had brought with it additional anxiety and frustration but i would like to add that no matter the delay and any problems we get this is the best place to be under the circumstances of domestic abuse first of all me and my child we are safe we receive a lot of emotional and practical support here it was very helpful to understand how serious the abuse was that i went through and how important it is to always keep my address secret and leave no chance for my perpetrator to contact me the assurance that we did the right thing removing ourselves from abuse and understanding that it wasnt all just my sensitive feelings or overreaction went a long way in feeling more confident being manipulated for years makes you doubt yourself in every thought you have and every step you make she had to take a covid test while staying in the refuge after a visit to hospital for a stomach sickness and high temperature while at the hospital one of her children spent the night with one of the refuge workers but social services recommended this was limited to the one night it was difficult he didnt want me to go without him and he was crying on my way out she wrote i was very worried about the covid test if it would be positive maybe my child had it too then the possibility to pass it on to the woman who was looking after him also my housemate who has asthma and her kids she was ultimately discharged and the test returned negative but because she had visited a hospital she had to selfisolate for two weeks from the rest of the refuge although her housemate offered to help i was having difficult time accepting help my expartner that i spent years with he used to call me worthless and useless and ungrateful all the time she said slowly he destroyed my selfesteem and my personality i was just there to cook food and clean and take care of his needs this left a very big impact for me to ask and accept help from anyone now not being able to do my usual daily things was making me feel anxious and stressed a lot she says that selfisolation compounds how isolated she feels having left her previous home refuge helped me a lot she wrote it was a lifesaving decision to move here but there always comes the feeling of isolation having to go through lockdown and now selfisolation made it even worse especially when you are sharing your home with another family you dont really feel free at your own home you dont even feel that you are at home the shortage in spaces in refuges during lockdown has

him another has an ex banging on doors and windows at night demanding to be let in an angry male smashes a spade against his exs front door trying to force entry one caller has been threatened with a shotgun by a family member and has barricaded herself in a room a teenager asks police to take her away from her abusive parents finding lockdown with them intolerable a young girl calls in tears shes not a victim of abuse but shes finding lockdown with her family a bit overwhelming and says she wants people to relax wednesday were still getting the usual calls which arent relevant to police and many appear to be oblivious to the crisis an elderly man has had a tv delivered and hasnt a clue how to set it up i tell him this isnt an appropriate use of the emergency line he tells me its an emergency for him i give him a couple of numbers to call thursday mental health has always been an element of many calls to the police and the crisis has brought about a notable increase either from people suffering with their own mental health or concerned friends relatives and partners perhaps theyre not getting their usual level of support or the absence of normality has exacerbated their problems a man walking the streets calls to say hes being chased by aliens i hear him knock on a strangers front door asking to come in some calls make me smile im praying to allah the prime minister will be ok one person says i usually phone you when im drunk but today i am not you will be ok too were meant to ask in any call where officers will be attending if anyone at the property has covid symptoms but when someone is screaming and shouting and youre struggling to get basic information its not always possible we advise the public on physical distancing guidelines yet our callhandlers can only comply with them when space permits friday were getting a lot of calls about people breaching physical distancing the majority of people are abiding by the rules but there are still large gatherings taking place particularly in warmer weather some curtaintwitching detectives are providing exact times of the comings and goings of neighbours even photos and car registration numbers there will be innocent reasons for many people such as delivery of shopping and medication and there simply arent the resources to investigate smaller incidents you wonder what the true motivation for some of the calls is but some tipoffs are valid and helpful a cupping business has a steady stream of customers visiting i dont know what cupping is so the caller explains as i look at some quite gruesome photos on google suction cups are placed on the skin of the back sometimes cuts are made and blood is drawn a dog grooming business is open when officers go to the address the proprietor is about to

stalking support services and police forces have recorded a surge in perpetrators turning to online tactics to harass their victims during the coronavirus lockdown paladin a national stalking advocacy service and the suzy lamplugh trust which runs the stalking helpline reported a surge in cyberstalking involving social media messaging apps and emails in the first four weeks of the lockdown but the services and police warned there were still repeated examples of physical stalking despite the covid restrictions including a case in which the perpetrator waited outside the victims isolating parents house when the victim dropped off essential goods police forces took part in a nationwide stalking awareness week in april but the chair of paladin rachel horman remains critical of the police response to the crime saying they dont take it seriously and thats not changed since the lockdown horman a solicitor who works on stalking and domestic abuse cases said paladin had seen a increase in contacts from victims both by phone and email since the lockdown was imposed she said theres still a problem because they feel more isolated than ever they cant reach out to their normal support networks family friends etc because obviously theyre locked down like everyone else but stalking is still going on some people think that theyre safer now because people cant go out the same thats not the case the police unfortunately are still not taking stalking seriously despite everything they say the police will look at the incident in isolation without joining the dots together and looking at the whole picture the suzy lamplugh trust said nearly million people in england and wales are victims of stalking every year the trust said there was a drop in contacts to the helpline initially as people adjusted to home isolation but this has risen considerably with one caller describing feeling like a sitting duck in cases recorded by the trust stalkers have used the coronavirus as a threat one person told others that her victim who ran a cafe had the virus and did not wash her hands and another threatening to give their victim the disease the main stalking behaviours being reported to the helpline during the lockdown were unwanted phone calls emails and text messages and contacts over whatsapp facebook and instagram the trust said suky bhaker the chief executive of the suzy lamplugh trust said during the immensely difficult circumstances that many are experiencing amidst the covid pandemic it is essential that victims of stalking are not forgotten and that essential services continue to support them one police force nottinghamshire reported a near doubling in stalking reports during the lockdown period with cases from march to april compared with cases during the same period last year some victims in the force area have been forced to close down their social media accounts after stalkers targeted them on average times before they contacted police the force has issued two stalking protection orders under the lockdown with another one in the pipeline against a man in his s katy bourne the chair of the association of police and crime commissioners who was a victim of stalking called on pccs police forces and criminal justice agencies to ensure that despite the pandemic they were still putting robust measures in place to keep victims safe bourne the pcc for sussex said stalkers now have hours in the day uninterrupted to obsess over their victims a stalking advocacy service in bournes force area veritas justice reported a increase in cyber and online stalking activity bourne added the rise in cyberstalking due to the lockdown concerns me deeply we know all too well that this behaviour causes extreme distress and can unfortunately escalate quickly the severity of risk to a victim is now defined by the amount of time invested by the perpetrator in their obsession so with many victims receiving over text messages emails phone calls a day we know that these strong fixations could have a more sinister outcome bourne said that when lockdown restrictions were eased reports of physical stalking crimes were likely to rise as victims and their perpetrators have more freedom of movement and there may be an increase in thirdparty reporting bourne said she was concerned that interim charging protocols for the crown prosecution service did not specify stalking as a priority offence while not all stalking cases will reach a crisis point research has proved that early identification of stalking behaviours is ultimately about homicide prevention she said the uk national stalking helpline is on,2020-05,stalking support service police force recorded surge perpetrator turning online tactic harass victim coronavirus lockdown paladin

every vulnerable child has access to school during lockdown right our daughter liora sarnaik age has an education and health care plan and a social worker so meets the governments definition of vulnerable and should have been able to go to school when lockdown started i actually thought i might be one of those people who work from home learn how to bake a cake sort through the attic have zoom chats but liora hasnt been at school today there are only children attending lioras excellent special needs school downs view in brighton normally there are more than liora is not one of the these are all children who live in residential care because their families have not been able to cope with caring for them so they dont have a choice about going to school liora has three lifelong conditions uncontrolled epilepsy a chronic kidney condition and autism she cant speak and shes doubly incontinent shes beautiful upbeat and humorous and her father rahul and i adore her i desperately want to send her to school because without it she is home fulltime and needs someone to care for her all day every day from the moment she gets up to the moment she sleeps no weekends off my last day off was before lockdown so why are we not sending her to school on the first day of the lockdown i spoke to a school staff member on the phone its up to you of course but i wouldnt send her he said i cant see how it can be safe many of the pupils like liora dont have language they cant speak or understand more than simple words such as food drink toilet the majority have saliva issues they dribble and wipe their mouths on any available person or surface they dont know how to wipe their noses they are not able to wash their hands without help and often resist it they dont know how to social distance they dont know anything about the pandemic many are also violent to parents and teachers and they are not able to stop biting punching and kicking liora is not violent to others but she is to herself banging her own head with her fists when in pain or frustrated she needs close physical contact at all times to be cared for properly lioras headteacher adrian carver says if he lets more children into school they could simply die of contracting coronavirus these are his words not mine because it will be impossible to keep them and his staff safe hes having to turn desperate parents away which he hates doing as he knows how hard it is for us its pretty glib then of the government to announce that all children meeting the vulnerable criteria will receive an education clearly he has no understanding that thousands of disabled children cant go to school and thousands of families in utter crisis are having to care for their children fulltime the disabled childrens partnership has just launched a survey focusing on the hidden lives of families with disabled children during lockdown the findings will be announced some time in may and i expect there will be many stories like mine parents like myself cant provide what a school can offer we have constant big challenges with personal care with behaviour and with sleep deprivation as our children are often up in the night as well as being on the receiving end of violence today ive been punched kicked had an umbrella smacked around my head been screamed at hes smashed up the house again a parent wrote on one of my whatsapp groups without school its not only our children who are vulnerable its the whole family siblings hide in their rooms to get away from the behaviour parents are close to breakdown lioras father and i have a sense that we are expected to just suck it up so what do we need i want recognition at the highest level for families caring for their disabled children i want to know that if lioras dad and i fail to survive looking after her fulltime there will be a place for her in residential care a place she can be safe however there are no places in residential care in normal times never mind in lockdown and i want professional carers to be valued and paid properly for their extremely specialist skills caring for children like liora skilled carers leave their jobs because their wages are so low us parents are in a constant fight with each other first to get carers and then to keep them we are like rats in a trap its about recognition its about not being forgotten beverley cohen is a

when we first went into lockdown i suppose i thought well this i could deal with perfectly well if it wasnt for the baby obviously not being able to leave the house for months except to buy groceries and exercise isnt something i would choose but if i didnt have the baby this would be fine i could rewatch all the sopranos work my way through that list of korean films my friend camille sent me play video games i could bake more like everyone else is brew my own beer spend every evening cooking elaborate meals i could find myself suddenly in the sort of situation my friend david is in on a temporary teaching contract at corpus christi college oxford having spent most of the year lodging in a small room but now with everyone else away has been gifted full run of a mansion once occupied by the archbishop of canterbury life would become one endless rainedoff holiday but not for me because of the baby it is not hard to see why for so many people lockdown has provided ample opportunity to start resenting the existence of their children very few people it turns out when they decided to have kids considered what it might be like if they had them around while being forced to work from home during a pandemic both my partner and i work her maternity leave actually ended the literal week lockdown started our son was supposed to start nursery so what this means for us is that we now split work and childcare roughly down the middle of the day minding the boy for increasingly frazzled chunks as we try desperately to stay on top of everything else attempting somehow to replace the rich playtime schedule he used to enjoy in the world before the disaster the pressure is real and intense and there is every reason to suppose that i as his dad am getting off relatively lightly consider the trend academic journal editors have noted that women under quarantine are submitting fewer papers the burden of care work continues to fall disproportionately on women even in our relatively egalitarian household my partner is the one who has to be up in the night with the lad to feed and rock him back to sleep but now i want to say something wild and shocking something dangerous even something that im sure almost everyone reading this is bound to hate me for asserting actually the best thing about lockdown is looking after a baby the reason for this is really very simple for me and i imagine for most of you every lockdown day is fundamentally the same every day the same routine and so every day bleeds into one last year a norwegian island called sommary which is the sort of place where its perpetual daylight in summer and perpetual darkness during winter announced as a sort of publicity stunt that they were going to abolish time now this abolition appears to have been extended across the whole world the only difference is that while the sommary timefree zone campaign imagined the end of time as a sort of liberation you could have a coffee on the beach at am we under lockdown have become slaves to a flat clock living the same day over and over again the only exception of course is if things are even worse if you or someone you love gets sick or loses their job if the disaster comes to you directly but a baby by contrast is that rare sort of human individual who can actually learn new things while trapped in a small private home when lockdown started our son was eight months old he could babble but he couldnt say any words he could sort of walk if you held his hands but not very well he could sit up but not by himself he couldnt really stand we tried to read him books but he was never really very interested all he ever wanted to do was suck the sides he was a terrible sleeper and could basically only be coaxed to do it if he was in his buggy or lying on his mother but now the baby is nine months old he can say the word cat which he typically does while literally running after the cat as he loosely clutches one of our fingers he can sit up fluently and haul himself up into a standing position using the furniture which he has also started to use to coast independently about hes mostly lost interest in his train and now much prefers banging and stacking wooden bricks he also has a little casio keyboard which he has somehow figured out how to hack so it can play piano and organ sounds simultaneously he is now so into books that he will literally demand to be read them and has very quickly mastered all the flaps in both dear zoo and wheres spot hes still an absolute wretched sleeper but we have at least convinced him albeit after days of screaming to do his naps in his crib he becomes more of a little person every day the world is opening up for him even the tiny restricted world of our home it is now somewhere in which he is clearly capable of recognising concepts and categories such as cat in which he has an obvious sense of his own agency another development has been that we were forced to get him his own remote control to distract him from chewing the real ones he now diligently points it at the tv sure that something might happen if he figures out how to press the buttons right of course the baby is incredibly hard work and im sure if you have kids theyre absolutely terrible in their own ways too but during lockdown he gives us back something incalculably valuable in return for our care a reminder that there might still be some progress that the endless sameness we would otherwise exist under might one day give way to something else i love you mate as you continue to talk as you continue to walk as one day who knows you might even learn somehow to sleep tom whyman is an academic philosopher and writer,2020-05,first went lockdown suppose thought well could deal perfectly well

children whose fathers spend time playing with them at a very early age may find it easier to control their behaviour and emotions which has a beneficial impact as they get older and start school according to a new study research carried out by cambridge universitys faculty of education and the lego foundation looked at how mothers and fathers play with children aged to years and how it affects child development while there are many similarities it found that fathers tend to engage in more physical play like tickling chasing and piggyback rides which researchers claim appears to help children to learn to control their feelings the research is based on a review of data from studies carried out mainly in europe or the us between and which found a consistent correlation between fatherchild play and a childs ability later to control their feelings researchers found that on average most fathers play with their child every day but even with the youngest children play tends to be more physical with fathers enjoying boisterous roughandtumble play with toddlers those children who benefited from highquality playtime with their fathers were according to the study less likely to display hyperactivity emotional or behavioural difficulties they also appeared to be able to control their aggression and were less likely to lash out at other children during disagreements at school paul ramchandani professor of play in education development and learning at the university of cambridge and one of the authors of the study said physical play creates fun exciting situations in which children have to apply selfregulation you might have to control your strength learn when things have gone too far or maybe your father steps on your toe by accident and you feel cross its a safe environment in which children can practise how to respond if they react the wrong way they might get told off but its not the end of the world and next time they might remember to behave differently children who only live with their mother need not be at a disadvantage the authors point out all parentchild play interactions in the early years are linked to more positive cognitive and socioemotional outcomes for children one of the things that our research points to time and again is the need to vary the types of play children have access to and mothers can of course support physical play with young children as well ramchandani said fellow author dr ciara laverty from the lego foundation said the findings had policy implications suggesting structures were needed that give fathers as well as mothers time and space to play with their children during the early years even today its not unusual for fathers who take their child to a parenttoddler group for example to find that they are the only father there a culture shift is beginning to happen but it needs to happen more,2020-06,child whose father spend time playing early age may find easier control behaviour emotion

there is something horribly sad about an empty playground for weeks now the primary school next door has been far too quiet save for the odd key workers child no breaktime hubbub no morning schoolrun chaos i didnt realise how much i had missed the sight of small persons exploding through the gate at home time until a handful returned this week one more baby step perhaps towards normality but the truth is childrens lives are not really back to normal and will not be for some time talk to parents and the stories come spilling out of angry children sad children bewildered children who have only just got used to lockdown and are now thrown off balance all over again by emerging from it this week i spoke to the mother of a sevenyearold who burst into tears at the idea of going back to school because she was terrified of getting coronavirus and dying and another whose toddler is so unsettled by returning to his old nursery after three months off that he wont sleep in his cot children are sticklers for routine and like to know whats coming but we can no longer tell them with any certainty its stressful enough for grown adults so every parent will wonder about the psychological impact of growing up under this shadow will the millions of children born or raised in a pandemic shake off their strangely disjointed early lives when its over or will there be longer lasting effects for the covid kids the crossparty house of commons petitions committee has been trying in a fascinating set of hearings on family life in lockdown to shed some light on that curiously underexamined question the maternal mental health alliances alain gregoire testified to a huge increase in mental health problems among new mothers which should sadly have been predictable imagine the loneliness of maternity leave with no grandparents swooping in to take the baby for a bit no cafes to hang out in no playgroups for finding others in the same boat and clinging to them he would he said also anticipate greater difficulties among young children who in the near future will be attending nurseries after months of parents having to manage children with emotional or behavioural problems at home without expert help from school or nursery over half of adoptive parents surveyed by adoption uk meanwhile reported greater anxiety distress and challenging behaviour among their children whose traumatic early lives can make them unusually sensitive to change but while ministers are now finally making plans to help children catch up academically the government has said little about coping with the emotional and behavioural aftershocks of the pandemic even as mental health professionals are bracing themselves for a tsunami of postpandemic referrals its obvious from the unemployment figures that child poverty will soar without some major intervention we know too that the gap between rich and poor childrens attainment will widen while schools are closed thanks to studies on how disadvantaged children slide backwards even during the long summer holidays but its harder to gauge the impact on childrens mental health which was more fragile than anyone would have liked even before the pandemic the work is starting the nuffield foundation has launched a research project on the changing face of early childhood in a pandemic the childrens commissioner anne longfield is on the case and several academic studies are underway but there are precious few precedents for children in developed countries losing this big a chunk of their lives down a black hole there will of course be lucky families brought closer by the intimacy of lockdown it has transformed the landscape of fatherhood giving new dads who can work from home far more time to bond with their babies several friends with teenagers confess to a bittersweet nostalgia for lockdown which has bought time with restless offspring they wouldnt otherwise have had denied the company of their friends even surly yearolds may eventually be bored enough to talk to their parents although the days of hanging out as a family are ending now as teens seize on the easing of lockdown to reclaim more freedom than the rules would strictly allow but while one lost summer feels like a tragedy to teenagers it may turn out to have been more critical for toddlers now missing out on an entire developmental stages worth of learning to share play and listen with other toddlers which is half the battle in getting ready for school for other children too small to understand exactly whats happening but old enough to have soaked up their parents anxiety and grief there will be consequences by all means get the schools back as soon as safely possible but dont imagine that will be anything like enough gaby hinsliff

serial domestic abusers or stalkers should be registered and monitored in the same way as serious violent and sexual offenders a group of crossparty mps have said as they put forward a proposed change to domestic abuse laws currently passing through parliament the amendment to the domestic abuse bill for england and wales which is at the committee stage of scrutiny would put serial domestic abuse and stalking offenders on the violent and sex offender register visor and subject them to monitoring and management through multiagency public protection arrangements mappa visor is a database of records of those required to register with the police under the sexual offences act those jailed for more than months for violent offences and those thought to be at risk of offending while a mappa is a coordinated arrangement between agencies responsible for managing an offender in the community the amendment is designed to help authorities join the dots and prevent further tragedies committed by repeat domestic abusers and stalkers like that of hollie gazzard who was stalked and murdered by asher maslin maslin was involved in previous violent offences three on gazzard on an expartner and seven on others other relevant cases include that of molly mclaren who was abused and stalked by joshua stimpson he had done the same to at least two women before but mclaren knew nothing about his history he stabbed her times the proposed addition has been tabled by yvette cooper the labour chair of the home affairs select committee and backed by the conservative chair of the women and equalities committee caroline nokes it also has the backing of the labour mp rosie duffield who has been praised for speaking publicly about her own experiences of domestic abuse cooper saiddomestic abuse and stalking destroy lives there are too many heartbreaking stories of people who have suffered terribly or even lost their lives as a result of domestic abuse or stalking by someone who had committed similar atrocious crimes before thats why we need much stronger action against serial abusers who go from victim to victim and arrangements to track and monitor those perpetrators in order to protect future victims and prevent further abuse serial domestic abuse and stalking offenders should be proactively identified and monitored in the same way that other violent and sexual offenders are action must be taken to protect others from them in the future they must not be allowed to keep reoffending with impunity wrecking more and more lives laura richards founder of the paladin national stalking advocacy service said i have worked on many cases over the years and the same failures same patterns repeat the lessons are never learned women are being spectacularly failed every day it is systemic failure and we need urgent law and culture change to focus on the perpetrators behaviour i strongly urge the government to look at the evidence base of hundreds of women and girls who have been abused terrorised raped and murdered by serial domestic violence offenders and stalkers who were allowed to offend with impunity and ensure this important amendment is supported in the domestic abuse bill this will save lives paladin cited further cases where such a change would be pertinent linzi ashton was beaten strangled and murdered by michael cope who had strangled two previous partners his repeat pattern of abuse towards women was not joined up justene reece took her own life after nicholas allen coercively controlled her and stalked her relentlessly when she left

the day my mothers conviction for the murder of my father was quashed marked a turning point for our family and for society yet why a year on from the landmark case that recognised the abuse my mother suffered are we still failing victims of coercive control and seeing her story as unique my mother sally is now discovering life as an independent woman for the first time since the age of free from the coercion and control she experienced for over years from my father watching her learning to make her own decisions while slowly unshackling from his spectre have been moments to cherish our journey has not been without difficulties weve had to learn how to acknowledge a life lost in my father and how to rebuild our relationships my mothers story represented one of the worst cases of coercive control reported she was only when she met my father who was he was charismatic funny and charming and young love bloomed however early on my mother challenged him about seeing another woman he responded by dragging her down the stairs and throwing her out of the door for the rest of her life she was scared to confront him in case he did it again a culture of fear and dependency followed over the next years he bullied and humiliated her isolated her from friends and family controlled who she could socialise with controlled her finances and restricted her movements coercive control which was added to the statute book in is no longer a new offence extensive training has been provided to police forces in england and wales yet we are still failing to correctly record it following recent reports of disparities between forces clare walker a domestic abuse consultant said the police record domestic abuse wrongly i know they do from reading their logs namecalling and the like are not logged as domestic abuse coercive control offences doubled in the year ending march from to considering that coercive control is the bedrock of domestic abuse these figures show gross underreporting they represent a fraction of the domesticabuserelated incidents recorded by the police the same year calls to domestic abuse helplines have increased by up to during the lockdown rachel williams who was shot and severely injured by her violent partner in says the government doesnt understand coercive control government needs to recognise coercive control because at the moment the impact to them of physical violence seems to be more severe but when you speak to a victim they will tell you the mental torture far outweighs the physical it certainly was for me she says this failure to raise national awareness and correctly record offences of nonphysical forms of abuse such as coercive control and economic abuse not only silences victims it abandons them furthermore the sustained mental impact on victims can raise the risk of suicide or as in cases like my mothers cause people to lose control and strike out at their abusers it is a reality that my mothers case is not unique and that there are more women still in prison whose abuse has not been properly explored the centre for womens justice is currently supporting women serving murder sentences and two serving excessive manslaughter tariffs where their abuse has not been taken into consideration the charity plans to publish key research later this year on what is and isnt working within the justice system for women who kill in situations of abuse opportunities to better understand and tackle domestic abuse consistently present themselves in the voices of survivors and specialist services time and again these voices seem unheard and the urgency to tackle this epidemic is absent the longawaited domestic abuse bill now at the committee stage offers a onceinageneration chance to change our approach not only do we have an opportunity to better tackle domestic abuse but to provide strategies and awareness to tackle its very heart coercive control through relationship education and by including amendments that cover postseparation abuse something my mother was subjected to the chance to do this is now not being able to see my mother on the first anniversary of her freedom has been difficult much as it has been for many families at this time but it has been a stark reminder of the neardecade she spent in prison it has served as a reminder too of the many victims who remain isolated with

if you believe the negative stereotypes only children are innately insular and maladjusted if you believe the science practically no developmental differences exist between only children and kids used to squalling with siblings but when it comes to how only children are weathering social isolation during the covid pandemic its hard to know what to believe are selfsufficient only children unusually capable of hunkering down with their own company for months or with playdates cancelled and school on hiatus is one really the loneliest number after all the answer as you perhaps anticipated hinges on the unique personality of every individual child according to the writer megan lane so far isolation has been a nonissue for her nineyearold daughter simone from the outside looking in she is the same happy child she was prior to lockdown says lane she has yet to mention loneliness oliver a yearold only child living in brooklyn has also been evenkeeled throughout quarantine sure he found seeing all his friends cancelling their birthday parties kind of sad but on the other hand hes been using his extra time to take up photography its a little bit hard being an only child during lockdown because i only have myself to hang out with he admits before sensibly adding but its probably a good thing because were living in a new york city apartment and if we had one more person it would probably be too tight according to the child clinical psychologist dr henrilee stalk parents of only children need not worry too much about the longterm effects of childhood social isolation at this point were expecting that a lot of kids who are coming out of this lockdown will continue to be resilient and adaptive says stalk thats especially true if parents are modeling calmness and providing solid consistency and structure throughout their kids days by communicating well with their child and striving to provide sufficient activities of course it can be tricky being your childs sole friend and playmate especially when youre a parent juggling work household responsibilities and your own anxieties the biggest challenge for us as parents with an only kid is the entertainment factor says sara gillooly a realtor and mom of fiveyearold alina normally she would have kids at daycare to play with or youre able to socialize with your friends who have kids and now she doesnt have any of that so you feel bad youre like ok well ill play barbies or legos or whatever it is you know after three hours of play youre kind of done right we were thinking of getting a dog to have a break which is crazy because a dogs not a break older only children like simone and oliver can be quite capable of keeping themselves busy ive seen simone happily turn a cardboard box into an owl costume a twohour project that she completed on her own while i took care of household chores says megan but thats not to say older kids are necessarily having an easier time with all this in fact stalk says kids in their preteens and up are potentially the age group that would have the hardest time being away from their friends because friends play such a big role in their life at that age as theyre understanding their identities as individuals apart from their families because maintaining friendships is important for older children stalk encourages parents to support whatever methods of socialization their kids gravitate towards for oliver thats looked like playing a lot more call of duty that isnt you know my favorite activity says melissa olivers mom but its kind of amazing that he has never had any interest in video games before and just realized all of his friends were there playing together so hes like ok im going to play some video games although kids are generally resilient stalk notes that mental health and behavioral issues can be exacerbated by the stress strangeness and stagnation of the pandemic if you have a child with a tendency to be more socially anxious around their peers we would expect that their anxiety would potentially worsen with less peer exposure says stalk the same goes for a child who is more prone to low mood or at risk of depression some children may develop new behaviors while sheltering in place for example sara noticed alina regularly a very happy kid has become a bit anxious you cant leave the room now without her panicking when before she really wouldnt care she says according to stalk its perfectly normal for children with no history of behavioral issues to express unprecedented anxiety anger or sadness in response to the stresses of lockdown fortunately stalk believes kids will probably recover from such feelings within a few months of resuming their regular social patterns i think as we start to move towards six months of quarantine we might be looking at more difficulties says stalk social development for kids is a lot like scaffolding you have to build it up and if there are gaps that can be a little hard to recover from if we are facing longstanding cultural changes and were not really able to create as much social interaction as we like that could potentially cause some difficulty for kids as they develop their development might look less focused on individual interaction and potentially might move towards more comfort with virtual interaction she says whether they have siblings or not kids today are coping with stress strangeness and isolation during a formative time one day they will tell us exactly what kind of an impact the pandemic had on their lives,2020-06,believe negative stereotype child innately insular maladjusted believe science practically developmental difference exist child kid used squalling sibling come child weathering social isolation covid pandemic hard

domestic abuse calls to the police surged by more than a tenth in london during lockdown research reveals driven by reports from neighbours and family members there were calls to the metropolitan police concerning domestic abuse in the weeks from march up on average compared with the same period in the increase which equated to about more domestic abuse calls a week was driven by thirdparty reports such as neighbours rather than the victims researchers at the london school of economics centre for economic performance cep found prof tom kirchmaier the director of the ceps policing and crime research group and coauthor said the increase in calls from third parties might point to an increased awareness of noise because neighbours are now at home or a potential underreporting by domestic abuse victims or a combination of these factors the london school of economics and the met launched a social media campaign during the period directing people to tobeheardcouk which provides information on how calls can be used to alert the police even if the caller cannot speak working with the mets strategic insight unit the team found the overall level of domestic abuse crimes not

respectively dr ria ivandi the research coauthor and postdoctoral cep research economist said there has been a considerable shift in the type of abuse recorded during lockdown with abuse by expartners falling but abuse by current partners or family members rising this is important as it shows some people are suffering considerably more these victims should be targeted by focused policies our work

domestic abuse campaigners and victims have accused the government of not valuing the lives of migrant women in forthcoming legislation on the issue they are urging the government to make lifesaving changes to the domestic abuse bill which will be debated for its final stage in parliament on monday the step up migrant women coalition a collection of more than bame specialist frontline services migrant and human rights organisations including the latin american womens rights service southall black sisters and amnesty international uk has accused the government of leaving a gaping hole in the groundbreaking legislation arguing that it will not provide any support for abused migrant women who have no recourse to public funds the decision to leave migrant women out of this bill sends the message that their lives are not valued they are disposable they are secondclass people they are invisible said pragna patel the director of southall black sisters currently domestic violence victims on spousal visas can access support for three months but women on any other visa with a no recourse to public funds stipulation cannot with this bill the government isnt just invisibilising abused migrant women its worse than that said patel it knows they exist but it is deliberately choosing to ignore their needs she said the issue had been brought up repeatedly with victoria atkins the minister for safeguarding who said more assessment of the situation was needed the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding jess phillips has tabled an amendment proposing a pause on the no recourse provision for migrant victims who meet a legal aid test the argument the government uses is that these women should go home and have their whole lives taken away by their abuser said phillips in these situations the state is continuing the threat of the perpetrator who says no one will believe you you wont have anywhere to go and have no support and right now the abuser is absolutely right phillips argued that the bill also did not provide economic stability for communitybased support services although she welcomed a statutory duty on local authorities to provide support for victims in refuges specialist services for black women or disabled victims and male victims are no better served than they were said phillips they will have new tools but the funding decline in the specialised sector during years of austerity wont be abated by the bill the bill also includes a statutory definition of domestic abuse and would establish a domestic abuse commissioner and create a new domestic abuse protection notice and domestic abuse protection order womens aid is calling for an end to the presumption of contact in domestic abuse cases we know through our work that safeguarding concerns are often not believed or understood in the child contact system said sophie franciscansfield a senior campaigns and policy officer at the charity we need fundamental reform changes have already been made to the bill including the addition of a clause to remove consent for sexual gratification as a defence in court proceedings for causing serious harm following an month campaign by we cant consent to this after a campaign led by the nspcc the bill will now explicitly recognise that children are victims of domestic abuse in their own right and the bill has also been amended to guarantee survivors access to special measures such as screens and waiting rooms in all courts and to expand a ban on abusers crossexamining their victims campaigners including labours stella creasy are continuing to push for an amendment that would lead to misogyny being treated by police as a hate crime agenda the alliance for women and girls at risk is calling for training for frontline professionals to be made mandatory this would cost m and would provide longterm savings argued agendas chief executive jemima olchawski simply asking the question in the right way is the first but crucial step if followed up by appropriate support it has the potential not only to change lives but to save them she said a spokesperson for the home office called the bill a gamechanging piece of legislation that will transform how we deal with this horrific crime adding that the government had announced m to support victims of domestic abuse sexual violence and modern slavery womens

during the pandemic according to an investigation by the bbcs panorama threequarters of victims also say the lockdown has made it harder for them to escape their abusers the joint investigation by panorama and womens aid is the first indepth study into how the nationwide shutdown in response to covid has impacted victims of domestic abuse using statistics obtained from uk police forces under freedom of information laws the panorama programme to be screened on monday evening reveals that there was one domestic abuse call every seconds in the first seven weeks of lockdown the recorded calls include reports of violent offences such as kidnap arson revenge porn and even poisoning on the programme presented by victoria derbyshire one woman using the name jess explains how the pandemic had intensified the abuse she was enduring on the night the lockdown was announced she said her husband told her what this meant for her she said i was at home with him we were both listening to boris johnson and he looked over at me he had his arms folded back and chest out cos he knew that would intimidate me and he looked at me and he said let the games begin and he said if you think it was bad before with the rape youre in for a rough ride so the rape started really really really bad really bad curtains would get closed tv would be up loud front door would be locked music would be turned up

warned that the lockdown would result in an increase in domestic abuse and violence nineteen days after lockdown began the government announced it would give an additional m to domestic abuse helplines and launched a social media campaign to encourage people to report domestic abuse but fiona dwyer ceo of the womens aid charity solace told panorama the timing was dreadful it should not have taken days to mobilise any sort of action and what it highlights is that it wasnt a priority for the government it wasnt thought about for the better part of three weeks and then m is just really its a poor effort victoria atkins the minister for safeguarding told panorama that she does not believe the government was too slow to act when we were talking to charities in the very very earliest

the tragic story of a manager who tried and failed to save his employee from domestic abuse has stayed with elizabeth filkin he did his best but he didnt know what else to do she says filkin the director of employers initiative on domestic abuse a business network that raises awareness of the crime says the manager offered support to his employee after becoming concerned that she was being abused he said he would go to the police with her but she said she had a plan in place and was fine a few days later the womans partner killed her after he discovered she was planning to leave it was devastating for that manager and all of the employees says filkin whose network has enlisted more than firms since lockdown began the shift to more flexible home working has been hailed by some as a gamechanger for working parents and cited as one of the few potential positives for women from the coronavirus crisis but as more companies consider making working from home a permanent goal campaigners and politicians including the former prime minister theresa may are warning that home is not a safe space for every worker faced with having to keep staff safe while overhauling work practices a growing number of firms are offering more support including paid leave and emergency accommodation while also training publicfacing staff to spot the signs of domestic abuse and offer help to those in distress filkin cites another manager who feared for an employee and instead of contacting her in ways that could have been intercepted he told her that her presence was required in the office for one day and that she would need to bring her passport so her records could be updated that allowed her to come into the office and he pointed her to a specialist service where she got help he might well have saved her life each year million people in the uk are affected by domestic abuse and during the lockdown there was a sharp increase in incidents as victims were trapped at home with perpetrators for more and more firms the penny is dropping that they need to act says suzanne jacob the chief executive of safelives who provides training to help managers and other employees recognise telltale signs of domestic abuse and offer support during lockdown we have seen an increase in major firms stepping up and investing in domestic abuse awareness training and resources she says its hugely encouraging because domestic abuse is not a private matter it is a crime that is enormously damaging so employers have a duty of care to take it seriously larger firms are implementing a range of measures to protect staff the law firm linklaters for example worked with safe lives to create a new policy and support package and now provides emergency accommodation and up to days paid leave it has also partnered with the charity surviving economic abuse we want to send a clear message to any of our people living with abuse that they are not alone we care and the help they need is available to them says david martin a global diversity and inclusion partner at the firm the housing association stonewater has been awarded domestic abuse housing alliance accreditation after improving specialised schemes to support people fleeing domestic abuse after increased demand during lockdown aviva is training staff to help clients who might be victims of domestic abuse and has introduced a package of measures to help staff were helping our frontline colleagues to know what to do if they take a distressing customer call or have concerns that something isnt quite right says danielle harmer avivas chief people officer domestic abuse comes in many forms and as an insurer its crucial that we spot the warning signs whether the abuse is physical psychological or financial victims can also find sanctuary in shops after the uk says no more campaign set up a network of safe spaces during the lockdown including in boots superdrug and morrisons pharmacies they simply need to ask to use the consultation room and are then provided with specialist domestic abuse support services and national helplines but according to nicole jacobs the domestic violence commissioner for england and wales still more companies need to urgently tackle the issue and the government should be forcing them to do so she argues that the uk should learn from new zealand where employers are required by law to provide days of paid leave to survivors of domestic abuse some employers have started to offer this on a voluntary basis and i call on the government to place a legal duty on employers in this country to provide this kind of support she says a workplace can become a lifeline for survivors and a place of respite and safety but equally employers who fail to understand the dynamics of domestic abuse can add to the anguish faced by those subjected to it,2020-08,tragic story manager tried failed save employee domestic abuse ha stayed elizabeth filkin best didnt know else

womens charities have raised concerns that victims of domestic violence are being refused places at refuges even when there is capacity because they do not speak english those turned away include a mother with a monthold baby who was fleeing violence after being held as a slave by her exhusband karma nirvana which supports those at risk from forced marriage and honourbased violence said the issue had been exacerbated during lockdown during that period there was an increased demand for refuge places and a dearth of interpreters across the public sector of women the charity could not find a refuge for during lockdown it said five were turned down by six separate refuges for not speaking english they included a woman who came to the uk three years ago and was held in domestic servitude by her violent husband and his family she said they forced her to cook and clean and never gave her money even when she was pregnant and needed essential items after the birth they even kept money i was given as a gift there was a lot of emotional and physical abuse and they threatened to take my child away she said adding i felt trapped and i used to cry a lot after she fled with her baby karma nirvana contacted several refuges including some that had capacity and promoted spaces for victims unable to speak english but they all refused the mother a place eventually the police were contacted and she was put up in a hotel until a suitable refuge was found natasha rattu karma nirvanas executive director said weve had cases where weve had to advocate to the ends of the earth for someones safety because of a language barrier despite there being a place available we are talking about women whose lives are at risk it is mainly migrant women who are suffering and it is discrimination rattu said the issue was part of wider inequalities facing black asian and minority ethnic women and that funding should be ringfenced to improve service provision for these communities she said we have real issues coming out of lockdown around resources and funding when we talk about black lives matter and equality it should be an opportunity to ramp this up the agenda ikwros womens rights organisation which supports middle eastern and afghan women and girls set up its own refuge in partly in response to the language barriers faced by its clients its founder diana nammi explained we only have eight beds so we have to refer women elsewhere language should not be a barrier to safety but this is a problem and its completely unacceptable at the moment we are providing language support for four clients in other refuges because it was the only way we could get them in lucy hadley campaign and policy manager at womens aid which has more than members that run refuge services in england said the situation was really concerning there has been a shift in recent years to competitive tendering practises in local authorities which dont always value quality over cost this means in some cases there are organisations without specialist expertise running some refuges pathway project which runs two refuges in staffordshire was among providers that had struggled to provide refuge space because they could not access appropriate services to support nonenglish speaking women it said years of budget cuts made it harder than ever to provide translation services its ceo hayley baxter said wherever possible we have worked with agencies to provide translators and english courses but this has become increasingly difficult and more support for migrant women is vital there is little or no free or affordable services for charities to access that can provide the help we need in the form of translation services she added it is extremely sad that in organisations are still having to make the decision to turn migrant women away not because of lack of space but because they cant be offered the service that they need and deserve a spokesperson for the ministry of housing communities and local government said it was completely unacceptable for refuges to turn women away because of a language barrier they said since weve invested m in safe accommodation services to support victims of domestic abuse and announced a m package to help survivors during the pandemic including a m emergency support fund for charities providing refuge this article was amended on august

when koas boyfriend strangled her in she managed to escape by jumping out of a secondfloor window at the time the two had been dating for about three years the fall ended up breaking her ankle but koa was able to run to her neighbors and call if my will to live hadnt outweighed his will to kill me i would have been dead she says koa and her boyfriend stayed together for several years after the assault they lived together and had a child throughout the relationship koa says the abuse continued in as she was preparing to spend christmas with their baby daughter and her parents she looked up and took in the holes all over her house from where her boyfriend had punched the walls thats when she decided to leave it took a few more years for the couple to split they finally did so in but that wasnt the end of their story koas ex has spent the last years stalking her and their daughter now a teenager over that time koa now has taken out multiple protective orders against her ex has moved between four us states and even had her identity legally changed with the help of a domestic violence services program about a decade ago the guardian reviewed police reports and citations court transcripts disability findings emails text messages and audio recordings to verify koas account of her relationship and the aftermath and is using a pseudonym to protect the subjects privacy she has considered leaving the country but hasnt wanted to the us is her home i honestly do not remember if he has even been penalized on paper koa says for violating protective orders the abuse she suffered during and after their relationship has left koa with physical and mental disabilities including a head injury which has resulted in persistent memory problems and complex posttraumatic stress disorder a type of ptsd that comes from enduring longterm trauma she suffers from episodes in which she loses consciousness due to anxiety according to documents the guardian reviewed related to her disability claims the documents directly tie her health problems to her exs abuse specifically noting his assault eleven years is a long time to stalk someone koa says the justice system has done little to protect her and sometimes has put her further in harms way koas case may sound extreme but the circumstances that led to it the repeated failures of the criminal justice and family court systems technically in place for her safety are common years of seeking protection from these and social services have left koa having to fight for herself and her daughter without the support she needs to fully extricate herself from her abuser koa recalls calling the police after multiple other instances of her ex becoming violent with her before the couple split up which usually resulted in a verbal warning or a citation since he assaulted her in koas ex has spent brief periods in jail and koa says a psychiatric hospital but has always gotten out and been able to find her the last time koas ex physically assaulted her in he punched and attempted to strangle her according to a letter from the shelter where koa stayed after the attack in the new life that koa has tried to build away from her abusive ex he has appeared through some combination of bureaucratic mismanagement and law enforcement officers failing to abide by practices meant to safeguard survivors of intimate partner violence several years ago a law enforcement officer revealed koas changed identity and address to her ex after the guardian ad litem the courtappointed person who is meant to represent a childs best interests assigned to their childs visitation case recommended a wellbeing check this compromise of privacy was both a flaw in the system intended to protect her and simply the way things work sometimes when the guardians of that system dont prioritize victim safety it ultimately helped koas ex remain on her trail when the coronavirus outbreak hit the us koa noticed she felt safer than she had in years her ex hadnt contacted her in quite some time it had been more than a year since shed moved from the east coast to hawaii a decent amount of time for someone used to relocating roughly every year and a half to keep her location secret travel restrictions and lockdown procedures meant koas ex wouldnt necessarily be traveling anytime soon and although she dislikes having to wear a mask in public koa realized she appreciates the anonymity its provided nobody can recognize me she says i am scared for when they say ok you dont have to wear a mask any more this relative feeling of security disappeared when koa got a text from an unfamiliar number in april the text which has been reviewed by the guardian contained koas home address at the time nothing else she couldnt verify who sent it but she believes it was her ex around the same time koa says she received texts from another unfamiliar number the sender identified as betty which koa knew to be the name of the woman her ex married sometime after they broke up the name has been changed to protect the subjects identity one of the texts contained a callback number when koa tried the number betty answered but denied sending her any text messages the women are no longer in contact but koa says betty told her that her marriage had also turned abusive and she believed koas ex was headed to hawaii in may the pandemic then became more of an obstacle than a protection courthouses operations were limited and advocates koa had previously been speaking to had gone silent probably overwhelmed responding to situations arising from the pandemic all koa could do was relocate again in midapril to a place she describes as very private but temporary shes tired of running but with the pandemic straining legal and advocacy resources she feels trapped unable to ever truly let her guard down reports of intimate partner violence have surged across the globe since march but stories of escalating abuse tend to focus on people who live with their abusers not those who have escaped tk logan a behavioral scientist at the university of kentucky who studies stalking says abusers are probably still stalking their exes during the pandemic even if this behavior hasnt been formally studied yet were hearing about increased calls about partner abuse logan says but metrics that track stalking are more nuanced and therefore not as readily available many studies on stalking require survey respondents to answer questions rather than rely on reported numbers from agencies studies logan has conducted in the past found that about half of abusers stalked after a protective order over the years koa has taken out three protective orders against her ex all in the east coast state where her parents lived and where she and her ex lived at the time of his assault she feared filing orders in other states where she had no family or support system would give away her location although the orders specified no contact with the victim her ex was able to either call her from jail or have a friend contact her on his behalf after the last protective order in koa says her ex built a small army of people to harass her online for months accounts she didnt recognize posted comments questioning the credibility of her claims about her exs abuse and threatening physical violence according to logan spreading rumors that can damage reputation is a typical stalking behavior so is creating financial problems for the victim koas ex has only paid a fraction of his courtmandated child support and hacking their social media accounts though only of stalking victims said they were stalked for five or more years per us bureau of justice statistics logan says former intimate partners who were abusive tend to stalk their victims longer than stalkers who did not have intimate relationships with their victims approximately one in six women in the us are stalked in a year according to the stalking prevention awareness and resource center sparc of those women the national coalition against domestic violence says are stalked by current or former intimate partners meanwhile pandemic conditions can exacerbate prior stalking behaviors says jennifer landhuis the director of sparc in washington dc victims have less access to protective factors such as jobs and services and abusers may have more time to gather information on their expartners landhuis adds landhuis says sparc recommends victims seek out local service providers like shelters and consider reporting the stalking behavior to law enforcement but koa has found that this advice hasnt always applied to her in april after receiving the anonymous text message containing her home address koa says a local domestic violence shelter turned her away because she didnt have hard proof that her ex was nearby instead the shelter suggested koa call the police if her ex showed up at her home an administrator for the shelter responding to a request for comment said they operate as an emergency shelter and couldnt discuss particular cases when koa called the local police department to report that she believed her ex had contacted her however an officer notified koas ex of the report an act she feared would anger her ex putting her in more danger she called the police department back and spoke to a lieutenant intending to explain why this was a potential problem the lieutenant insisted on the merits of police calling her abuser to tell him to leave her alone the guardian has verified koas account of this conversation with an audio recording of the call how will this guy stop if he never knows youre making a complaint against him the lieutenant can be heard asking koa on the call koa said her goal was not to put law enforcement in touch with her ex im just trying to make a paper trail she said so that when he does get me then people know who to look at the lieutenant told koa that it was normal protocol to contact the subject of police reports when koa asked to see the departments policies that state this protocol the lieutenant told her youll just have to take my word for it speaking to the guardian for comment a different lieutenant from koas local police department said depending on what type of case is reported contact may be made with the suspect for followup judge elizabeth hines who presides over a domestic violence court in ann arbor michigan notes that instantly responding to abusers who begin stalking their exes has been effective in stopping those behaviors no matter how small the protective order violation is hines says it is crucial for offenders to hear from law enforcement which sends the message that more serious violations can result in jail time this strategy however puts tremendous pressure on stalking survivors to report the harassment to law enforcement whom they may not trust for various reasons it also assumes victims can identify intimate partner violence stalking at its outset for years koa saw herself first as a survivor of assault then a victim of the criminal justice system that failed to protect her only after that did she consider herself a domestic violence survivor i had no idea that i was in a domestic violence relationship until she says today it has been years since koa has directly spoken with her ex she says she has no clue as to whether he traveled to hawaii in may or not though she believes hes still on the mainland but knowing that the police have been in touch with him she has prepared herself for another encounter and the sense of safety she once felt has been slipping away over the course of several conversations koa spoke about the ways in which the pandemic could make things harder for her next time there is word from her ex she and her daughter are considering moving abroad but leaving the us could be nearly impossible under current international travel restrictions still koa hopes to change her circumstances she says she is moving forward with a complaint against the guardian ad litem who requested the wellbeing check that resulted in koas personal information being shared with her ex several years ago she is also working on finding someone to help investigate her child support and custody case from which she says was mishandled im not letting this define me says koa for now fighting for freedom from her abuser has become a part of her daily life between family courts failing to hold her ex accountable law enforcement officers revealing her location to her ex and domestic violence services being unable to accommodate her protecting herself has become almost a fulltime job its a job koa has gotten very good at legal documents letters from shelters and audio recordings of phone calls create a detailed paper trail of her search for closure and tell a story of loopholes and close calls that end with koa relying almost entirely on her own survival instincts for safety shes been her own best means for survival so far,2020-09,koas boyfriend strangled managed escape jumping secondfloor window time two dating three year fall ended breaking ankle koa wa able run neighbor call live

must do under the safety plan there are things on the list the father the reason we are all there isnt even required to turn up to the meeting i am her voice when she feels unable to speak i am a fierce advocate articulating the level of responsibility they are placing on the survivor of abuse and comparing it with that given to the perpetrator all this is done virtually and i wish i was in the room with my client to support her through this i video call her as soon as the meeting is over she is fast descending into a panic attack thankfully we have been working on grounding techniques

emotional resources and self care guides i contact rape crisis for a consult i call her back to update on my actions and she begins to cry i didnt think anyone would care she says i thought theyd say it was my fault thursday i facilitate domestic abuse awareness training for brighteyed social work students an overwhelmingly majority of safeguarding referrals to social services relate to domestic violence i ask them how much of their degree syllabus is dedicated the topic we had a lecture on it one volunteers and the others nod friday a client was attacked by her husband last night and is in hospital i spend the morning on the phone with the safeguarding lead nurse and the refuge coordinator this time when my client is discharged she will not be going home i call another client she is reluctant to talk she was referred by social services and doesnt want to work with me my role is to support survivors to stay safe whether or not they decide to leave we run through a safety plan for her at home and i give her several phone numbers should she ever need us in the afternoon i have my clinical supervision an essential part of my practice we talk about my week and i shed some tears for my clients and what they have endured i reflect on the impact of my work on myself and go through some visualisations to help me release any trauma i may have absorbed this is my reset this is what means i will come back in on monday ready to do it all again i work with highrisk survivors for a short window when they are in crisis my job is to make them safer i wonder if they know how i

six months ago our country went into lockdown almost immediately we saw both the best and the worst of human behaviour for many charity truly began at home with family members caring for shielding relatives and neighbours pulling together in new and different ways but for some it was abuse rather than charity that began at home deeply troubling statistics have shown the sharp rise in domestic violence since march it is thought that globally cases have escalated by in the uk more than a third of specialist services have reported an increase in requests for their support yet nearly twothirds of victims have felt unable to seek help for fear of repercussions from their partner or because of the restrictions of covid safelives the ukwide domestic abuse charity of which i am patron has been undertaking an online survey of people living in abusive relationships over the past few months the responses have been heartbreaking his emotional and verbal abuse is escalating the longer were isolated and im concerned that mentally i wont survive this every so often he gets on his high horse and pushes me or spits in my face and he shouts and scares us psychologically i feel unsafe being coercively controlled by my exhusband as he has my daughter he is using the covid situation to further control and making it difficult as i am in the vulnerable category too i am powerless and have noone to help me no one to help me over the years i have been privileged to meet many women men and children who have escaped domestic abuse and who are determined to tell their stories to save others one such person is vicky she managed to leave a violent relationship and her expartner was sent to prison but vicky rather than celebrating found herself grieving for the life she had had before the abuse so she decided to move forward by using her albeit unwanted personal knowledge of domestic violence to help others she started working for the police supporting victims and witnesses of crime with a particular focus on those who had experienced stalking today vicky says i am about to commence my independent domestic violence adviser course there is life after domestic abuse i am evidence of that but far too often those living with abuse do feel there is no one to help i have learned how vital it is to spread the word about the help that is available for any readers in that situation please know that you are not alone as well as the national helplines details below you can also find assistance in shops including boots superdrug and morrisons pharmacies where the uk says no more campaign has brilliantly set up a network of safe spaces if you request a private appointment in a consultation room you will be given information about how to access national advice lines and local specialist services some of you might be worried about a friend or relation in these situations a simple inquiry can be incredibly powerful earlier this year safelives started the reach in campaign as it is so hard for those living in an atmosphere of coercion and fear to reach out safelives provides guidance on how you can prepare open a conversation gently ive noticed you seem a bit down has anyone upset you listen reassure and support one woman whose concerned workmate took her aside writes if you are a colleague of someone who you believe is being abused ask them say you will help they may deny the abuse say they dont need help but your offer will make them stronger in many ways they will know inside they have an option that they will be believed and when they do escape the abuse it will be in part because you reached in the medias role in reaching in is equally crucial and i am deeply grateful for the guardians work in this area i have often said that domestic violence is characterised by silence of the abused of the abuser and of those who dont know how to intervene but the media have the ability to break this corrosive silence bringing us the voices of victims shattering the taboo and raising awareness of what we can all do to stop this heinous crime as ever efforts that are united are the most powerful in the words of safelives together we can end domestic abuse for everyone and for good after six months of lockdown it is clear that covid is not the only pernicious disease that has been attacking our society while many aspects of our lives are now slowly returning to some kind of normality we must also remember there are those for whom the lockdown of fear and abuse remains it is therefore vital that we continue to do everything we can to help

in late july i tweeted asking families with autistic or learning disabled children to share their experience of sparkling actions by health and social care professionals i was writing a book about how professionals could make a difference in the lives of children and their families and the manuscript was woefully negative the tweets started appearing and the thread grew across the next few weeks they included extraordinary examples of what i came to call pockets of brilliance an administrator who included pug memes in the appointment letters for a dogloving young patient professionals who were prepared to sit on the stairs so a child could stay in their bedroom during a visit the gp who told one mother i dont know very much about autism but i promise you that i will do all i can to learn another gp who rang a mother in the evening after hed been kicked during a distressing appointment gently asking what he could do to help these behaviours could be badged as reasonable adjustments but to give them any type of label is part of the problem the shoehorning of human actions based on kindness thought and sense into jargon dehumanises what should be everyday normal conduct these tweets generated a visceral feeling in me in part because of the simplicity of the actions captured why would you not ring someone after a particularly difficult appointment to check on them isnt remembering what children like and engaging with their interests an obvious way to generate good relationships telling a parent their child has been a pleasure to support is commonplace surely and then i return as i often do to the way in which our beautiful son connor was left to drown in an nhs hospital bath while nearby staff finished an online tesco order certain people children and adults in our society are consistently and routinely positioned outside of being human leading to an erasure of love care and thought by social and healthcare professionals they become disposable some people kicked back on the tweet thread asking why should basic decency be applauded these encounters are not examples of brilliance they are examples of good practice and shouldnt be held up as something special i agree the problem is they remain so rare that they are extraordinary some stories dated back years and part of their power and significance is in how much they stand out in peoples memories these pockets of brilliance provided a hook of relief to write around but there were further knocks i contacted one mother to ask if she was happy for me to include her tweet as a finale to the book as it was so moving particularly given what had happened to connor a support worker on daughters unit has asked if she can switch her shift so she can be in the car to bring my daughter home for good on thursday she had tweeted the mother replied that i could use it but it wasnt to be the high point i had hoped to finish on she added that despite the support workers request she didnt actually turn up with her daughter she still has no idea why in addition to the tweets key largely unknown figures emerged through my research people who called out appalling practices sometimes repeatedly in the s michael pantelides from cyprus was working as a nursing assistant at ely hospital in cardiff and raised concerns about abuse his concerns were ignored and he eventually wrote to the news of the world leading to the first nhs public inquiry and the setting up of the hospital advisory service a precursor of the care quality commission cqc waless first minister mark drakeford chillingly says it took fresh eyes to recognise the abuse four decades on terry bryan a nurse at winterbourne view approached the bbc after witnessing horrific abuse by staff on residents at the assessment and treatment unit for people with learning disabilities and autism he had made complaints to his employer castlebeck and the regulator the cqc which were all ignored in may panorama exposed the abuse with shocking footage captured by a reporter in a few weeks of working undercover at the unit near bristol what has also become clear to me is how much the treatment of people and their families remains on a failing loop despite extensive research legislative and policy change to make their lives better and potentially transformative moments like the exposure of the winterbourne view scandal at the heart of this loop are loving families and a diverse range of allies surrounded by a large cast of bystanders who instead of fresh eyes have vision clouded by ignorance and sometimes prejudice to rehumanise society we need more people with guts and integrity who are prepared to step up and call out poor practice and to look afresh at how we could do things

girls with autism are not being diagnosed because they are adept at camouflaging their behaviour in an effort to try to fit in according to a new study autism is diagnosed in of the population and a diagnosis is made more often and earlier in boys with a reported ratio of four males to every female according to the paper published in the journal of autism and developmental disorders the study explores how autism may manifest differently between sexes with females who have autistic traits using behavioural camouflaging strategies so that they appear less autistic in social interactions which can in turn lead to a delay in diagnosis researchers from the centre for innovation in mental health at the university of southampton university college london and liverpool hope university looked at social reciprocal behaviour such as taking turns following someone elses lead and being flexible in a study involving participants aged between eight and including both autistic and nonautistic boys and girls participants were asked to take part in an interactive drawing task in which a researcher and participant took it in turns working together to create a drawing points were awarded for reciprocal behaviour among female participants the autistic and nonautistic children had almost identical scores with autistic girls achieving an average score of compared with in the neurotypical group among boys however the nonautistic children achieved a significantly higher social reciprocity score at compared with in the group with autism dr henry wooddownie research fellow at southampton education school at the university of southampton said better awareness of camouflaging could lead to increased support for those who might otherwise miss out we need to raise awareness of camouflaging in general in terms of educating school staff gps and other practitioners because there seems to be a lot of autistic females flying under the radar as things stand and we want to raise this awareness so that girls who need it can access support at the earliest stage possible because early intervention is usually key in promoting positive outcomes dr julie hadwin of liverpool hope universitys school of education studies added camouflaging itself is something that can lead to difficulties its a stressful effortful thing to do girls describe camouflaging as constantly having to be something theyre not and of course thats a really difficult thing to maintain jolanta lasota chief executive of ambitious about autism the national charity for children and young people with autism said the impact of camouflaging could be catastrophic for autistic girls and women attempting to mask or hide autistic behaviours in social situations is extremely damaging to young peoples mental health she said we work with many autistic young women who have reached crisis point after struggling for years without getting the help they need autism is still often wrongly thought of as a male condition and we need to tackle this outdated stereotype otherwise autistic women and girls will continue to face the damaging consequences of a late or missed diagnosis,2020-10,girl autism diagnosed

year for domestic violence that any of us who are in the sector now have ever experienced says foster there have been just so many more strangulation cases so many threats to kill so many more serious head injuries and sexual assaults have been going through the roof she says the coronavirus restrictions combined with unemployment and financial stress linked to the pandemic have caused domestic violence cases to spike across the country at the same time those on the frontline say that despite the federal governments m in additional domestic violence funding announced in march there simply havent been enough resources to meet demand for chronically underfunded support services unprecedented demand in july a survey by the australian institute of criminology revealed almost of australian

the first commissioner for domestic abuse for england and wales who will have significant powers once the domestic abuse bill becomes law early next year has committed to working closely with the campaign to tackle femicide the killing of women at the hands of men at a virtual event last thursday attended by more than people nicole jacobs expressed her sheer frustration at the postcode lottery and lack of a coordinated response on the part of agencies to tackle the killing of women we all have such an urgency for change she said the event marked the publication of the femicide census entitled if im not in on friday i might be dead the words of judith nibbs beheaded by her husband dempsey nibbs in the census reported last week in the observer analyses why and how over a year period women were killed by men one woman died on average every three days twenty men killed twice the rate of killing has remained unchanged over the decade in spite of increased awareness investment in police training and changes in the law jacobs the designate domestic abuse commissioner was previously ceo of the charity standing together and has worked to tackle male violence towards women and girls for more than years she pointed out that her powers allow her to seek information from public bodies make recommendations and to expect the authorities to respond within days the femicide census highlights how data in areas such as recording ethnicity histories of abuse and official inquiries into police conduct in investigating abuse and femicide are often sparse inaccurate or incomplete the census was founded by karen ingala smith chief executive of nia a sexual and domestic violence charity and clarissa ocallaghan a former solicitor they head a small team who research each killing with pro bono support from freshfields bruckhouse deringer an international law firm and consultants deloitte the census only includes cases in which it can be legally said a man has killed this woman the report states that patterns of male violence are persistent and enduring we need to see the patterns to stop women being killed ingala smith said on thursday patterns of male violence were discussed by a panel on thursday that included professor jane monckton smith from the university of gloucestershire she has established eight stages in a relationship that may predict femicide they include a history of stalking andor abuse coercive control planning to kill and a womans decision to leave the relationship the femicide census records that in of cases perpetrators had a history of violence sixtytwo per cent of women were killed by a current or former partner four in of the dead women had left their killer or had announced an intention to do so we still think deaths are about a man out of control a red mist coming down so they are not predictable monckton smith said they are nimco ali the governments adviser on violence against women and girls speaking in a private capacity said that a womans experience of male violence is vital in leading and shaping policy davina jameshanman who has reviewed many domestic homicides for the home office said that when women speak out about their abuse as seven in dead women in the census had done they go unheard they are routinely assumed to be liars in a call to action ocallaghan said that of charges of murder in femicide secure a conviction and that is a success unlike the abysmally low conviction rate for rape when a woman is allowed to speak in court the system becomes beyond dysfunctional it is only when she is dead that it is hyperfunctional she also pointed that none of the leaders of the main political parties had commented on the census and the persistence of the rate of femicide shame on them she said jacobs said that to tackle femicide and violence against women and girls we need to drive change by establishing what good looks like,2020-11,first commissioner domestic abuse england wale significant power

imagine a man hitting his partner the picture that comes to mind probably involves a scruffy individual his hand raised and his face contorted with fury we can all condemn that cant we but what if the angry face is familiar seen thousands of times in a very different context if it belongs say to the worlds most famous and admired footballer diego maradona judging by the outpouring of grief that followed his death at the age of it seems too big an ask to admit that our heroes especially our sporting heroes have been credibly accused of domestic violence maradonas face just doesnt fit in that unpleasant picture unless youve seen the video first aired on an argentine tv channel six years ago it appears to show maradona hitting his then girlfriend a former professional football player called rocio oliva who was three decades his junior unsteady on his feet maradona shouts at her and then appears to strike her twice the slaps are clearly audible on the soundtrack as is oliva shouting at him in spanish stop stop maradona didnt challenge the videos authenticity but he did deny hitting oliva i grabbed the phone but i swear to god that i have never hit a woman he insisted it wasnt the first time oliva accused maradona of abusing her although charges were never brought another incident occurred on a plane in front of dozens of witnesses when maradona verbally abused oliva before grabbing her by the neck the couple split and got back together several times before oliva left maradona for good two years ago maradonas death on wednesday happened to coincide with the international day for the elimination of violence against women on the same day official statistics revealed that a fifth of offences recorded by police in england and wales during and immediately after the first national lockdown amounting to more than a quarter of a million in three months involved domestic abuse these statistics might have given maradonas obituarists pause for thought but they didnt domestic abuse is routinely overlooked or rendered invisible especially if the alleged perpetrator is an elite sportsman or famous actor when the olympic athlete oscar pistorius shot dead his girlfriend reeva steenkamp commentators initially bought his story that he believed she was an intruder it was only much later and after protracted legal proceedings that pistorius was found guilty of murder relationships in which women are abused are often described as volatile depersonalising blame but maradonas jealous outbursts he once threw oliva out of his home in dubai after wrongly accusing her of flirting with the manchester united goalkeeper david de gea will be horribly familiar to any woman who has experienced coercive control last month glowing tributes were paid to the scottish

published in cilento described locking herself in a bathroom for protection after connery hit her in the face knocking her to the floor and a second blow sent me flying its not even as if he was a repentant abuser i dont think there is anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman although i dont recommend doing it in the same way that youd hit a man he said in an interview with playboy in an openhanded slap is justified if all other alternatives fail and there has been plenty of warning he confirmed his views in an interview with barbara walters in not condemning domestic violence

one in five offences recorded by police during and immediately after the first national lockdown in england and wales involved domestic abuse figures have revealed police recorded more than a quarter of a million offences flagged as domestic abuserelated from april to june the office for national statistics ons said the offences represent a rise of from the same period in and an increase from two years ago the ons said the number of offences flagged as involving domestic abuse had been increasing over recent years so it could not be determined whether the rise was due directly to the pandemic in april may and june roughly a fifth and of offences recorded by police were flagged as domestic abuserelated the number rose each month with the biggest rise between april and may the easing of lockdown measures at this time may have made it safer for victims to seek help the ons said as restrictions eased the proportion of offences that were domestic abuserelated fell slightly likely due to

abuse than black white or asian people the figures revealed helen ross from the onss centre for crime and justice said the number of domestic abuserelated crimes recorded by the police continued to increase in the year ending march this may reflect improvements in police recording and an increase in victims willingness to come forward up to date evidence shows this increase continued into the lockdown period however it cannot be determined whether this can be directly attributed to the coronavirus pandemic she added data suggests that experiences of domestic abuse may have intensified

people who work for a welsh commissioner will be eligible for financial support to leave an abusive relationship in a pioneering scheme designed to break down a key barrier that stops domestic abuse survivors escaping the welsh future generations commissioner sophie howe has launched a policy believed to be the first in wales and possibly in the uk giving staff suffering domestic abuse access to a grant or loan howe said financial constraints were one of the biggest bars to leaving an abusive relationship and is hoping other organisations across wales and further afield will follow her example in march last year the commissioner became the first employer in wales to offer paid domestic abuse leave to her workers a policy since adopted by the welsh government and at one welsh local authority under the new financial support policy employees working for howe can apply for a cash grant of up to a salary advance or a loan of up to to help pay for anything from essential supplies to relocation costs including rent or a deposit on a home howe said domestic abuse has longterm consequences for victims and their children we often think this is just a matter for police or social services but the reality is that employers have a massive role to play in helping to keep their employees safe in work and at home howe has workers and hopes her scheme will encourage others to introduce similar policies she said we all have a duty to help others to live free from domestic abuse and to protect those around us from harm if there is a barrier to safety that this money can alleviate we will make it available whether that be for starting a new home to adapting an existing one childcare or even paying for pet boarding gwendolyn sterk of welsh womens aid welcomed the scheme saying violence against women domestic abuse and sexual violence is everyones business mutale merrill the ceo at bawso which supports victims of domestic violence from black asian and minority ethnic backgrounds said women face enormous challenges in leaving their families and everything that is familiar to them in order to escape abuse and protect their children they face financial uncertainty mental dislocation and often language barriers which complicate understanding and communication the commissioner worked with the domestic abuse campaigner rachel williams from newport south wales who was shot by her partner in williams said this could help so many people who are prevented from leaving a situation that could kill them people are offered financial support for many reasons including losing a job yet someone leaving a dangerous home often doesnt know where theyre going to sleep that night this sort of practical support would have given me another option i would have left years sooner had i not been worrying about where my children and i would go and live society puts pressure on people especially women to leave an abusive relationship without always thinking about how they might be able to youre starting again from scratch sometimes after years of building a home the commissioners role is to be the guardian of future generations this means helping public

victims of domestic abuse should not be denied legal aid because they have assets trapped in a home the high court has ruled the judgment has been handed down as a legal watchdog warns that those who need legal services are being failed partially because of cuts to legal aid the domestic abuse ruling by mr justice pepperall concluded that a single parent and domestic abuse survivor who had only in the bank should not have been refused legal aid for a child custody case the decision according to campaigners means the legal aid agency can adopt a less restrictive approach over granting help to survivors of domestic abuse where they have trapped capital in homes which cannot be sold or borrowed against the laa will have to reconsider whether to grant legal aid to the woman who has only been identified as claire the public law project which supported her argued that many domestic violence survivors are denied by the laas strict interpretation of its rules daniel rourke a plp lawyer said no one should face an abusive former partner in the family court alone because they cannot afford legal representation the ruling has implications for other women in claires position the laa will have to carefully consider whether it is appropriate to include the value of their homes when considering their applications for legal aid claire said this ruling could mean i wont have to face my abuser in court without being represented the last time i had to face him in court was horrendous i had to speak for myself whilst he was there with a barrister i was so nervous and scared that i was physically sick in the courtroom my mum has already taken out so many loans to help me through this so hopefully she wont have to do that anymore if it means that other women wont have to face their abusers in court that will be amazing it really is an injustice being told you have to sell your house to fight your abuser olive craig of the rights of women said we frequently speak to women who cannot afford to pay for legal advice but are considered to be financially ineligible for legal aid we hear from victims of abuse who are having to resort to food banks to feed their children but are assessed as financially ineligible for legal aid meanwhile the femicide census year report conducted by the campaigner karen ingala smith has found that the number of women in the uk killed each year by men has remained consistent at between and for the past decade in total it recorded cases of women killed by men in of cases the perpetrator had a history of violence and in had killed before in of cases of intimate partner violence the victim had told someone about the abuse she was experiencing and in of cases the excessive violence and brutality used in the killing amounted to overkilling new research from victim support also found that victims of domestic abuse are being left in limbo and have been encouraged by police to take civil action rather than criminal prosecution due to the criminal court backlog of nearly serious criminal cases ten years of cuts and court closures combined with the governments incompetent handling of the pandemic has let victims down said the labour mp david lammy the shadow justice secretary in a report published on wednesday the legal services board said the legal market does not meet the needs of consumers and society and that people who need legal services are being failed millions of people are unable to get help partially because of cuts in the availability of legal and pressure on advice agencies run by charities and other organisations the report said dr helen phillips chair of the lsb which regulates the legal sector said it continues to be difficult for people to know when they have a legal problem and to engage with the legal services market and shop around it also reflects policy decisions taken over a long period relating to the publiclyfunded legal sector the report said that million adults in england and wales have an unmet legal need involving a dispute every year it calls for widening public access to advice and support and ensuring that no one has a worse outcome or quality of service due to their

in sasha marsden a yearold student went to a blackpool hotel for what she thought was an interview for a parttime cleaning job the man she met david minto had lured her there on false pretences he then sexually assaulted her and stabbed her times sasha could only be identified by dna taken from her toothbrush minto was sentenced to years in prison but for sashas family their grief has no time limit gemma aitchison sashas sister set up yes matters uk in response to the killing i wanted to know why this happened to sasha and what i could do about it she explains part of what her organisation does is to talk to young people about consent body image pornography and media influence what i know now is that as long as women are treated as objects and not people we will continue to be disposable this wednesday is international day for the elimination of violence against women which will see the start of days of activism against gender violence globally that same day also sees the publication in the uk of a groundbreaking report femicide census which for the first time in britain analyses the shocking killings of women and girls from the age of to at the hands of men over a year period the census defines femicide as mens fatal violence against women and reveals that on average a woman was murdered every three days a horrifying statistic unchanged over the decade this is in spite of greater public awareness increased research changes in the law and improved training for the police patterns of male violence are persistent and enduring the report states the scandalous lack of progress in reducing femicide in the uk is in part because each killing is treated by various agencies as an isolated incident and giving no cause for wider public concern as a result the report says information received from the police via for instance freedom of information requests can be sparse inaccurate or incomplete coroners reports often fail to reference a history of male violence while it is difficult to access official documents such as independent office for police conduct reports and domestic homicide reviews all of which along with media coverage feed into the database of the census to solve a problem you need to be able to say what it is says karen ingala smith chief executive of nia a sexual and domestic violence charity she and clarissa ocallaghan a former solicitor and now restauranteur published the first femicide census a sixyear review in three annual reports have since followed with the help of a small team of parttime researchers and pro bono support from freshfields bruckhouse deringer an international law firm and consultants deloitte now with a decade of deaths to look back on the census draws some damning conclusions about patterns of abuse and violence and what could have been or should have been spotted by the authorities of the victims almost half were killed by a sharp instrument sometimes with additional brutal violence classed as an overkilling the most common form of femicide is stabbing ingala smith says yet most knifecrime strategies focus on teenagers and gang crime strangulation was the second method nonfatal strangulation is often part of a pattern of abuse that is not sufficiently recognised and investigated ingala smith and ocallaghan support the campaign by the centre for womens justice to add an amendment to the domestic abuse bill due to become law next year to include a new offence of nonfatal strangulation sixtytwo per cent of the dead women were killed by a current or former partner most in their own homes four in of these women were preparing to leave or had already separated a crucial period and an opportunity missed for police and others on the frontline such as gps and mental health advocates to prevent a killing home is where the heart is is a bitter lie for many women the report says a history of abuse was evident in at least cases including coercive control stalking harassment and physical financial and emotional mistreatment a third of the women had reported their abuse to the police they still died the femicide census originally came about because of kirsty treloar a yearold nursery nurse who had asked for help police had referred her to nia ingala smiths organisation on january treloar was stabbed times by her abusive boyfriend myles williams aged i googled kirsty because we were told so little about her death ingala smith explains thats when i saw the shocking number of reports of deaths already that year eight women were killed in the first three days of ingala smith created a website counting dead women cdw now replicated across the world while cdw records every killing the census team researches and include only cases in which it can be legally said a man has killed this woman it cant be the case that we are the only ones collecting data like this says ingala smith but we are from the outset it was essential to include all thecircumstances in which men kill women not just husbands partner and family femicides ocallaghan adds the state is failing to protect women failing to implement policies failing to take on board recommendations you can spend time training but if on the ground you dont implement the tools that are available including injunctions nonmolestation orders and bail conditions you are failing to save womens lives and thats a human rights issue over the decade sexual motivation ended the lives of women one perpetrator raped and killed a yearold on their first meeting she had internal injuries and bite marks thirtytwo murdered women had been involved in the sex industry sixteen per cent of victims were born outside the uk yet police recorded ethnicity in only a fifth of cases the domestic abuse bills provisions excludes migrant women if services are not alert to the reality that violence against women occurs across all backgrounds then they are less likely to identify those at risk the census points out ingala smith and ocallaghan say the states response is also dangerously gender blind globally while homicide figures are declining femicide is on the rise we have a domestic abuse bill not an end violence against women and girls bill ingala smith says that minimises sex differences men who kill do so within a context of endemic sex discrimination in a society that normalises male predatory behaviour from an early age and is too eager to blame victims the census points out that the uk remains one of few countries in europe that has not ratified the istanbul convention which draws on the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw it recognises that mens violence against women and girls will not be eradicated without fundamentally addressing sex inequality and the beliefs attitudes and institutions that underpin it the census points out eleven women were killed by their grandsons if you focus only on partner violence you are missing a whole spectrum of violence that may also be generational the report says excluded from the census are hidden homicides in one case for instance it was decided a woman had stabbed herself even though a witness said otherwise there should be more professional curiosity when a sudden death occurs in the context of domestic abuse criminologist dr jane monckton smith says in the report the subheading of the femicide census is if im not in on friday i might be dead these are the words of judith nibbs mother of five who was beheaded by her husband of years dempsey nibbs the report is dedicated to her memory and to every victim of femicide over the decade each name listed people say its only a few women a week that die gemma aitchison says but its been a few women a week ever since i was born and im its a huge systemic problem the census says these women matter the femicide census concludes with a series of recommendations including the thorough collection of sexdesegregated data ratification of the istanbul convention and improved funding domestic abuse costs society over bn a year a report last year calculated that m a year is needed to provide safety and support yet funding is a fraction of that in lockdown femicide has escalated if this government is really committed to ending male violence against women it needs crossparty support for a longterm womancentred approach that recognises sex inequality is intrinsic to a patriarchal society ingala smith says a start could be made if state institutions did their jobs properly the census is a unique benchmark of accountability however its future is in doubt we are dependent on donations and pro bono support ingala smith says i wish we could say we will be here for the next years but we cant if we

before lockdown my yearold daughter slept in her own bed every night without any problems she is an intelligent happy girl albeit a bit shy she eats well has good friendships and loves life we have talked about coronavirus to try to alleviate any fears she may have and we are very open i feel she knows she can talk to me about anything however during lockdown she started to want to be in my bed every night her greatgrandmother died in january and she says she misses her i didnt think she would be affected too badly by her death because she had met her only a handful of times so either her death has affected her more than i thought it would or she is using it as a way to show me she needs me without telling me the real reason when i put her to bed in her own room she shouts down to me asking when i am coming to bed and for a cuddle when i do go upstairs i cannot bear to have her feeling upset or alone so i allow her into my bed i dont mind because i am a single mum when i was a child i cried myself to sleep frightened most nights because i had unavailable parents but am i doing wrong is it possible she really is grieving for her greatgrandmother or do you think there may be an issue she isnt talking to me about there may be an issue she isnt discussing and she may not even be aware of it or the death of her greatgrandmother may have triggered something how did you handle the death she may also be worried about you dying or about you in general an event like this can be very destabilising even for adult children when children suddenly want to sleep with their parents its easy to think its because they are frightened for themselves but sometimes its because they want to keep an eye on their parents i note you are attending to her needs but who is attending to yours if you are a regular reader youll know i am an advocate of attachment parenting there is nothing wrong with wanting to comfort your child in the day or the night im always amazed by parents who attend to their childs every need during the day but feel this shouldnt extend to nighttime when everything is scarier but we must also be aware of who we are parenting our children or the child in us whose needs were not met when growing up because the ultimate aim is to raise children who are independent and feel loved i consulted child psychotherapist alison roy she said that allowing your child to sleep with you isnt an issue per se many children do this and then return to their own beds when theyre ready but there are a few things to be aware of talking generally she said that children might keep getting into bed when certain needs arent being understood and met during the day roy asked about daytime and what happens if you can try to spend more time with her during the day and be very present when you are with her she also asked if you two had had any difficult conversations about grief and coronavirus you didnt say what was discussed did you keep it fairly superficial when having these conversations not before bedtime talk about the practicalities for instance what happens if you get ill other family support network etc might she also be worried about school it can be tempting to avoid mentioning these issues but remember these feelings dont go away if they are not discussed they just fester and come out in other ways and if you show your daughter you can talk about these things it shows her how to broach difficult subjects too roy also suggested a good question to ask is how can i help you feel safe at bedtime and that when you put your daughter to bed instead of going straight downstairs save up some tasks to do upstairs so she can hear you putting away laundry say so are you doing something wrong no but be aware that if allowing her come in to your bed is an easy fix for something else maybe for both of you then you do need to dig a little deeper every week annalisa barbieri addresses a family related problem sent in by a reader if you would like advice

family violence victims and support groups have cautioned australian jurisdictions against criminalising coercive control as they fear the creation of new laws may not make women and children safer the parents of hannah clarke who was murdered along with her three children in queensland earlier this year say that laws should be introduced that would prevent behaviour that is not physically violent but can indicate that an offender is seeking to control a partner or former partner the behaviours can include isolation deprivation and monitoring and controlling appearance finances or access to children and are seen as a key indicator that a person may be progressing towards a physically violent attack rowan baxter murdered his estranged wife clarke and his three children after exhibiting different types of controlling behaviour in the years leading up to the attack clarkes parents lloyd and sue say starting in queensland the clarkes want to increase education around these behaviours and hope laws will be introduced that will criminalise them this would mean police could arrest and charge an offender for behaviour which in most states and territories is currently not a crime im sure it would have saved her sue clarke told guardian australia family violence victims and the support sector agree that these behaviours are deeply damaging and misunderstood but fissures are emerging about how best to deal with them lynda memery the manager of policy and campaigns at the womens legal service victoria said that coercive control should be included in the civil jurisdiction of all states and territories meaning it could be relied upon when it came to victims seeking court orders protecting them from their abusers but she said there was little evidence that showed the introduction of coercive control offences in tasmania scotland ireland and the uk had made women safer in pretty much every state and territory they are exploring this as they should be as they have a responsibility to look and see if theres something else we should be doing memery said on the surface it looks appealing but then digging a little bit further its not the right pathway to go down its a complex social problem family violence isnt something that can be fixed by any one law two women who said they had experienced relationships with elements of coercive control also told guardian australia they did not feel the creation of a new criminal law would have protected them the women speaking on condition of anonymity said it was clear there needed to be greater community awareness of what constituted coercive control but said entrusting police to investigate and charge the men responsible was not the solution one victim who is also a lawyer said unfortunately women including those from indigneous or marginalised backgrounds could not trust they would be treated equally in the criminal justice system i care very deeply about what happens to women but its clear that there are so many women in our society who dont receive the treatment from police and the courts that they should antoinette braybrook the chair of the national family violence prevention and legal services forum said any state seeking to criminalise coercive control needed to first ensure they spoke to the women who were affected and the organisations that supported them the forum comprises legal services for indigenous people experiencing or at risk of family violence there must be proper consultation with our communities and our legal services who are the experts on the ground every day supporting aboriginal and torres strait islander people particularly women and their children russell hooper the head of advocacy at no to violence which works to change the behaviour of male family violence offenders said improving community police and sector knowledge of the behaviours which constitute coercive control had to take precedence on any legal changes he said the organisation was agnostic when it came to creating a criminal offence tasmania is the only australian state or territory which has specifically outlawed coercive control the new south wales government announced last month that a parliamentary committee would hold a public inquiry into the issue a discussion paper it released at the time noted that the nsw coroners court domestic violence death review team had found that in of the homicides that it reviewed between march and june the relationship was characterised by the abusers use of coercive and controlling behaviours towards the victim in queensland the opposition said it would criminalise the offence before the recent election drawing a commitment from the palaszczuk government to review its approach to coercive control including its current inclusion in family violence legislation and an improvement to training for first responders a palaszczuk government spokesman confirmed the proposal hadnt changed since the government were reelected the victorian government is working through the recommendations handed down by its royal commission in the commission did not recommend the creation of a coercive control offence a bill is currently before the south australia parliament to introduce a coercive control offence and the northern territory act and western australia governments are reportedly all monitoring developments

calls to the uks largest domestic abuse helpline are rising week on week as new figures reveal that almost suspected killings may have occurred during the first lockdown the charity refuge which runs the national domestic abuse helpline said it was very concerned by the continuing upward trend in demand for its services with england a little over a week into its second lockdown separate data from counting dead women a project that records the killing of women by men in the uk identified murders with another strongly suspected cases between march and the start of july when covid restrictions were largely lifted the rate of killings conspicuously steep in the opening period of the first lockdown gradually lowers to levels similar to those recorded in previous years current calls to and contacts with the national domestic abuse helpline though rising sharply have not yet reached the levels witnessed during the first lockdown then more than calls were made during the first three months of the covid restrictions one notable aspect of the coronavirus restrictions was the use of technology to intimidate and control partners refuge said perpetrators were increasingly using smart locks webcams and social media or sharing revenge porn to harass their targets and that it had investigated cases of tech abuse in the first lockdown as a way of learning from the experiences of survivors and frontline services during the first lockdown refuge will this week publish a dossier based on interviews about what needs to change to prevent the same things happening again among the findings is a need for more safe homes with some councils only rehousing the street homeless during the first lockdown similarly there are calls for better mental health provision with the report detailing how one service manager supported four women who attempted to take their own lives during lockdown it also found that all the survivors interviewed were reliant on universal credit and had experienced delays in payments and difficulties in making a claim one survivor waited for nine weeks to receive her first payment after her application was made lisa king director of communications and external affairs at refuge said the experiences faced by women during the first set of lockdown restrictions should serve as a wakeup call as we continue through the next stage of lockdown and covid response what we know is that demand for our services rose significantly earlier this year and early signs show that that could well be repeated karen ingalasmith who compiled the counting dead women figures from internet searches and social media contacts said lockdown should not be used to excuse perpetrators she said it doesnt make abusive men out of nonabusive men it just increases the triggers that abusive men use to justify their violence her tally reveals that during the first week of lockdown women were killed far higher than the average rate for march in the following month another eight women were identified as having been murdered with another three suspected case another theme to emerge from the refuge audit was how perpetrators are adept at using coronavirus restrictions to abuse and intimidate one survivor sarah not her real name described her ordeal shortly before the pandemic she left her controlling partner and was embroiled in a legal battle over access to their son during lockdown he would frequently appear at her door he would turn up unannounced and conflict would follow i had nowhere to go i was scared in my own home scared to leave my own

each morning siena castellon synchronises her morning routine to music with the same minute playlist different songs act as time markers the trick is to choose music you love and to listen to the same playlist every day explains the teenager when wonderwall by oasis comes on she knows she should be brushing her teeth by the time summertime sadness by lana del rey is playing she is walking out the door as an autistic person castellon values a schedule and is most at ease with life when things are meticulously planned so the unpredictable nature of the last eight months has been challenging to say the least not only for the yearold but for the dozens of young people with learning difficulties she mentors through her online platform quantum leap castellon who has adhd dyslexia and dyspraxia as well as autism set up the mentoring forum in when she was just after struggling to find ageappropriate support it has since grown to reach subscribers globally and castellon supports up to children a week via email as well as parents seeking advice the new national lockdown measures are causing lot of anxiety for people like me she says its difficult to wake up one morning and be told you cant leave your house or go to school autistic people are really struggling with how uncertain things are one mentee constantly asks me what is happening with lockdown and i have to tell them i have no idea how long this will last others who contact her have received abuse for not wearing masks on public transport even though those with autism are exempt because face coverings can trigger anxiety as well as mentoring castellon is also a campaigner for childrens rights in november the teenager launched neurodiversity celebration week the campaign encourages schools and universities to celebrate the talents of children with learning differences more than students from learning institutes around the world take part now her efforts have been recognised as one of three finalists to be considered for the prestigious international childrens peace prize she was selected from nominees from different countries acknowledged for promoting childrens rights previous winners include greta thunberg and malala yousafzai who will award the prize in a remote ceremony on november autism is diagnosed in around of the population but because it is a hidden disability a much greater proportion of people are believed to have the condition castellon also believes gender stereotypes are an issue and that had she been a boy her autism would have been picked up much earlier the most recent research suggests the male to female ratio of those with autism is but boys are more likely to be diagnosed due to stereotypes surrounding the condition i talk to a lot of autistic people says castellon the men all tell me they were diagnosed at four or five the women often say they were diagnosed in their s or when one of their children was diagnosed i actually think there are an equal number of men and women who are autistic castellon always sensed she was different from other children i was an old soul as a kid i had no patience for makebelieve and playing she recalls other kids wanted to run around and play games which stressed me out because of my sensory processing disorder spd for castellon everything is brighter and louder and touch is amplified as i got older some social issues i was having become more noticeable i found it hard to maintain friendships and was bullied and ostracised it wasnt until she was that castellon got a diagnosis following a spell of extreme anxiety i could hear the electricity in the walls and my own heartbeat she remembers it got to the point where i couldnt go outside and my mother took me to the doctor looking back im shocked it wasnt flagged earlier castellon thought the diagnosis would make her life easier but it didnt there was a moment when i thought i would be understood and accepted but nothing changed she continued to be bullied and unsupported by teachers at school she moved school times in search of one that would not only accept her for who she was but that would sufficiently challenge her as an academically gifted student castellon is good at maths she got four a gcses at the age of and plans to study physics at university but she acknowledges that not everyone with autism is so gifted its a spectrum and there is a real range she says it is time to take apart these misconceptions because it prevents diagnosis there are autistic people who excel in art or history the government needs to prioritise addressing the obscenely long autism diagnostic assessment waiting times she insists the pandemic is increasing the chasm of inequality and hitting societys most vulnerable communities the hardest our government continues to fail the autistic community and people with learning differences significant diagnosis delays deny children the benefits of an early diagnosis negatively impacting their access to education and can lead to mental health issues such as severe anxiety explains castellon i hope our government finally takes the necessary action to ensure that the disabled community is treated with dignity and respect instead of as secondclass citizens who are not worthy of funding and support castellon also finds the representation of autism in film and media unhelpful not only is female representation lacking but autistic characters are commonly played by neurotypical actors someone not on the autistic spectrum such as keir gilchrist who plays sam gardner in the netflix series atypical this happens a lot says castellon even when it comes to telling our own stories we are not included in the narrative growing up much of the advice for autistic girls was written by male academics in their s claims castellon it drove her to write the spectrum girls survival guide how to grow up awesome and autistic published earlier this year it covers bullying dating and other challenges unique to autistic teenage girls one recent study found girls with autism are not being diagnosed because they are adept at camouflaging their behaviour known as masking in an effort to fit in as a child castellon says she was known as the girl who didnt smile i didnt have facial expressions and i didnt make eye contact which people made the biggest deal about the idea of celebrating the differences among the neurodiverse community rather than focusing on the challenges they face is the driving idea behind sienas schools campaign when i was diagnosed with dyslexia i was told you are not going to be able to spell i wasnt told of all entrepreneurs are dyslexic its really damaging to feel your difference is a burden rather than something to be celebrated if she wins the prize this week she hopes she will receive some funding to donate to charities of her choice there are organisations doing work to try and cure autism which just adds to the stigma i would give the money to

as a new national lockdown comes into force in england organisations working with people facing domestic abuse are making renewed calls for longterm funding and pushing for further amendments to the domestic abuse bill as it makes its way through the lords the impact of the pandemic on those facing domestic abuse was evident almost immediately during the national lockdown in march the counting dead women project told mps that between march and april at least domestic abuse killings had taken place much higher than the average for the time of year while calls to the national domestic abuse helpline were running at higher than normal three weeks after lockdown was introduced a recent survey of survivors and services by the charity safelives found that of survivors were unable to reach out for support during lockdowns partly because they werent able to access phone or online support or their perpetrator was with them all the time in august the charity released data showing that even with these continuing difficulties of services reported increases in demand during the previous month sarah davidge research and evaluation manager at womens aid says that people were facing extended time with their abusers at home while valuable lifelines are cut off including to friends and family and walkin centres shuttering as local services shifted from inperson to telephone or online support have created additional barriers if you think about the women who dont even have access to phones or the internet speak another language or theyre being prevented from access by their abuser then were really just scratching the surface in wales where a day firebreak lockdown came into operation on october fresh concerns have been raised about the impact on those facing domestic abuse our immediate fear with regards to the firebreak lockdown is that survivors will be isolated from their normal support system and will not be aware of the support that is available for them says a welsh womens aid spokeswoman frontline organisations throughout the uk including smaller specialist services catering for women from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and refugees and asylum seekers are under greater strain too the governments initial response to the pandemic was a funding injection of m early on but this was criticised as vastly insufficient in many ways covid has thrown into sharp focus numerous issues surrounding the protection of people facing domestic abuse that long predate the pandemic during a decade of austerity the sector has suffered drastic funding cuts including m slashed by councils for womens refuges in england wales and scotland between and the domestic abuse report from womens aid estimated that more than referrals to refuges were declined in meanwhile domestic violencerelated murders reached a fiveyear high in the uk in according to data compiled from police forces in addition falls in prosecutions of perpetrators have set off alarm bells with trial delays and other problems with the justice system including cuts to legal aid heightening concerns around access to justice for victims in london alone reports of rape and sexual offences increased by between and but convictions dropped by almost a quarter and the time it takes to bring charges of rape almost tripled one glimmer of light is the longawaited domestic abuse bill due to become law in early framed as a landmark piece of legislation by the government it will usher in significant reforms in england and wales among the new measures is the recognition for the first time of children as victims a ban on consenting to rough sex being used as a defence in murder cases and an acknowledgment of economic abuse in the statutory definition the inclusion of a statutory duty on councils in england to provide support for victims in refuges and other safe accommodation has been welcomed along with the statutory appointment of a domestic abuse commissioner nevertheless many in the sector are warning that as it stands the law is far from a panacea despite the government giving english councils a further m to help them prepare for their new legal duties to provide domestic abuse services concerns remain about funding shortfalls ellie butt head of policy and public affairs at refuge said that as a matter of urgency the government needs to commit to providing at least m per year so that councils can commission the refuge accommodation that women and children fleeing domestic abuse so desperately need womens aid estimates that to fund the sector in england and meet demand across services requires m annually there is also widespread frustration that despite concerted efforts the law will not guarantee protection for migrant women who because of their uncertain immigration status have no recourse to public funds leaving them unable to access statutory support elizabeth jimnezyez coordinator at the step up migrant women campaign says even before the pandemic four out of five women with no recourse to public funds were turned away by refuge accommodation a home office spokesman said ministers realised the pandemic had created new challenges for victims of domestic abuse pointing to the package of support made available in response including m for helplines and online services and m for charities supporting survivors of domestic abuse sexual violence and modern slavery as well as vulnerable children as well as its public awareness campaign youarenotalone on the bill he said this is a truly gamechanging piece of legislation and will transform our response to victims in every region in england and wales and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice but most people working in the sector dont feel it goes far enough as sophie franciscansfield senior campaigns and policy officer at womens aid says it would be really tough to argue job done once this bill passes because there is so much more to address there is so much more to a survivors needs than what is currently within this bill while the sector awaits confirmation of the domestic violence bills second reading in the lords the issue of adequate funding for services looms large in wales now into the second week of its firebreak welsh womens aid says we know that the abuse survivors face during this lockdown and the wider covid pandemic will have lasting impacts and we need reassurance that services will be sustainably funded and resourced beyond march the welsh deputy minister and chief whip jane hutt who was the first national coordinator for womens aid in wales says ministers are working hard to make sure that victims know what support is available to them but she adds i fear that victims will think that this firebreak period means they have to stay at home and suffer when abuse is happening that is not the case at all in england similar fears are being expressed we are concerned that another national lockdown will again make it harder for survivors to escape to safety says franciscransfield we continue to urge for a longterm sustainable funding solution for the violence against women and girls sector if it is to survive,2020-11,new national

londons independent victims commissioner is calling for a major overhaul of the family courts claiming the current system allows perpetrators legal opportunities to continue their abuse claire waxman said the domestic abuse bill awaiting its second hearing in the house of lords did not provide adequate protection to abuse survivors and left many having to face abusers repeatedly or pay for the cost of facilitating child contact arrangements she is working with lawyers to submit an amendment to the bill to prevent the family courts ordering survivors to pay costs associated with their children having contact with the person who perpetrated the abuse she said i have seen countless cases where criminal courts have granted a protective order such as a restraining order only for the family court to facilitate ongoing contact between survivor and perpetrator through repeated court hearings i know of examples where courts have granted perpetrators significant control over their victims life from afar including mandating how many emails from their abuser they have to respond to in a week waxmans comments follow a session at the house of lords last month during which survivors spoke of their experiences of the family court she said the pervasive culture of contact at all costs has put too many victims at risk of serious harm through unsafe child contact arrangements sometimes in their own homes and im aware of many cases where these survivors have then been ordered to pay the costs to enable these unsafe arrangements this is statesanctioned abuse and it needs to stop current legislation allows the court to order which parents should pay for supervised contact or other costs a criminal conviction is not necessarily a bar to a child having contact with the offending parent or to both parents sharing the associated costs charlotte proudman a human rights barrister said im seeing more and more that victims of domestic abuse are being ordered to pay of child contact costs to alleged perpetrators the vast majority of which are fathers who are not paying any child maintenance judges are not always giving due consideration to the parents financial means there have been cases in which victims of domestic abuse are ordered to pay half of the costs of their former partners contact typically per session in some instances women have been forced to pay the costs of contact out of their universal credit lucy reed a family law barrister and chair of the transparency project charity said once the court has made a decision it is in the best interests of a child to have contact with both parents it may well be the best way to facilitate that is by sharing the costs in my experience courts will make the best decisions they can knowing they have limited powers to enforce any financial aspect of their order and there is often no other source of funding but she said judges should give fair weight to both parents financial means she added courts should be alive to the fact that where there are allegations of coercive or abusive behaviour there is a need to avoid inadvertently making orders that either jeopardise a caring parents ability to provide for their child or that may inadvertently perpetuate financial control one woman a selfemployed writer told the guardian she felt the family court had perpetuated the financial abuse she suffered in her abusive relationship after ordering her to undertake travel costs so her children could visit their father abroad she said the court said he should come to england for some of the contact meetings but he refuses and will only take up the ones in his country im spending between and a month on train tickets a government spokesperson said where parents cannot agree on child contact arrangements independent judges will determine if an order is appropriate and whether costs should be shared it is never acceptable for parents to evade their financial responsibilities to their children and the child maintenance service will continue to clamp down on people who think they can abuse or dodge the system this article was amended on and november to remove some

monday im looking at the list of names on the office wall of all the women i support who are all involved in selling sex on the streets its our weekly team meeting and i brief my colleagues on how the friday night outreach team met marcia a homeless woman in a violent relationship she is sleeping with her abusive boyfriend because its safer than sleeping rough on her own he forces her to share needles and to sell sex we talk about ways to support her but without a phone or address its difficult its hard to find places i can meet with women like marcia many cafes where we build trust and rapport are closed i add her name to the list and fire off emails to the police and street homeless teams tuesday i open my laptop and find urgent emails from both probation and police regarding sally a woman ive been supporting a while back i received similar emails to inform me that one of my clients had killed herself my heart races as i open them my worst fears are confirmed sally has died due

who live here thursday precoronavirus thursdays were my favourite day of the week a colleague and i would take an early morning seat in a cafe near to where the women would sell sex wed wait for women to see us for a chat hot drink food however the cafe is shut and unlikely to open for months i sit at my desk feeling a pang of sadness it was always a great place to connect with women who did not have phones sally who died was often one of them i keep thinking that if it wasnt for the pandemic things could have been different for her we would have not lost connection i could have helped her with her substance abuse issues i call women on the phone trying to support them as best i can its not the same but its better than nothing friday im doing outreach tonight at pm a volunteer and i take condoms clean needles hot chocolate and food on to the beat we meet jenny and i remind her to contact her probation officer for an appointment next week shes grateful for the hat and gloves i give her as its getting chilly i spot natalie who i havent seen since before covid we cant hug now which feels sad often that would be the only nonexploitative contact shed have all night we leave her

more victims of domestic violence will be eligible for legal aid after the ministry of justice agreed to drop restrictive imaginary capital rules for home ownership that falsely inflated their wealth and deprived them of help the new regulations were introduced following a high court judgment in november which said that a single parent and domestic abuse survivor who had only in the bank should not have been refused legal aid for a child custody case legal aid eligibility is assessed by a complex means test the previous formula meant not all mortgage debt was taken into account and consequently calculated that applicants had disposable funds that did not exist the new regulations were laid as a statutory instrument on friday by ensuring more victims of domestic abuse are given legal representation it reduces the risk of them being crossexamined by their abusers in court daniel rourke a solicitor with the public law project plp who brought the case said it is plainly unfair to pretend someone has capital that simply does not exist for victims of domestic violence that has not been the case the regulations laid today in parliament will mean that many more vulnerable women on low incomes will be able to take part in family proceedings with the support of a lawyer in a fairer and more equal way our client identified only as rebecca is earning a low wage looks after two children and receives universal credit yet she was denied legal aid because the rules on home ownership have not been updated in decades this irrational rule ignored the fact that my clients home was heavily mortgaged and pretended that my client had capital which simply does not exist the imaginary capital prevented her from effectively participating in proceedings concerning her children family law cases have not been eligible for legal aid since the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act laspo an exception was preserved for survivors of domestic violence rebecca said getting legal aid is essential i absolutely need representation to go up against my expartner i cannot bear the thought of being cross examined by him when i found out that i wouldnt be eligible for legal aid it sent me into a tailspin ive had sleepless nights and constant anxiety after years of turmoil i have finally achieved some stability by buying a home for my children and myself so the idea that i should have to sell it is awful david greene president of the law society of england and wales which supported the plp case said there was a clear injustice in denying people legal aid on the grounds of mortgage debt nobody should be expected to sell their home and make themselves homeless in order to access justice it is good news that the ministry of justice is addressing this immediately

kevin blunnie describes june as an ordinary day for our ordinary family in the early hours of the following morning in harlow essex everything changed his daughter eystna blunnie three days away from giving birth to her daughter rose louise was beaten to death in the street by her former abusive partner tony mclernon he was convicted of murder and child destruction in he will serve years before he is eligible for parole blunnie and his wife susan have spent eight years campaigning to improve the system of investigation and accountability around femicide the killing of a woman by a man negative treatment by the media was one trial they had not expected to have to endure it was totally wrong we had reporters knocking on our door within hours blunnie says we had no privacy and they showed no respect it still goes on today a report published last week dignity for dead women indicates that the blunnies experience is not an isolated case in the online survey of a small sample of families who judged themselves resilient enough to participate two in three affected by fatal domestic abuse wanted to speak to the press to raise awareness to leave a fitting legacy to the victim and to tell our story however the same proportion of families said their grieving process had been damaged by press conduct some families had read news articles that described the victim as murderable and a nightmare others felt that the press had centred on the perpetrators experiences allowing him to play the victim while just under half of respondents reported that their experiences with the press were either somewhat positive or mostly positive one of the families said we had zero contact with the press so that was positive the report was drawn up by the charity level up which campaigns to end sexism domestic abuse campaigner david challen and advocacy after fatal domestic abuse aafda a charity offering specialist and expert advocacy peer support and a centre for excellence for reviews after fatal domestic abuse last year level up introduced the uks first guidelines on reporting fatal domestic abuse backed by press regulators the independent press standards organisation ipso and independent monitor for the press impress according to the femicide census a woman is killed by a man every three days the guidelines on the reporting of these deaths include the need for accuracy for example naming the crime as domestic violence and not a tragedy as well as the need for equality avoiding insensitive language and accountability placing responsibility on the killer too much reporting helps perpetuate the myth that fatal domestic abuse is almost mitigated because the perpetrator really loved the victim says frank mullane aafdas chief executive its a problem too when reporting implies a homicide has come out of the blue instead of recognising the pattern a trajectory which might be altered and homicide prevented if an appropriate intervention is made challen added we want more families to come forward to talk about their experiences so we can establish a strong case for better regulation challens mother sally was convicted in of the murder of her abusive husband richard she had been subjected to extreme coercive control for decades she subsequently won an appeal on grounds of diminished responsibility her charge was reduced to manslaughter and she walked free in after serving nine years again and again i had to challenge press reports challen says otherwise horrendous headlines on web pages live on in perpetuity no family should be retraumatised as a result of poor reporting standards mullanes sister julia pemberton and her son will were murdered in by julias husband she had feared for her life for months before the killings in mullane set up aafda which has since helped more than families a lot of control is taken from families after a domestic homicide he explains the home may now be out of bounds because it is a crime scene the coroner decides when the body is buried and the media publicises the familys private grief but it also allows ordinary citizens to present problems in the system to policy and lawmakers so a real onus exists on the media to act sensitively in the survey of families said they did not understand how to make an official complaint about the press in one case a national newspaper doorstepped a teenage family member when no adults were at home he was petrified my sisters killer would come for him he was also extremely anxious about saying something that could be used against him or allow her killer to be released said a respondent under ipsos editors code of practice anyone can make a complaint under clause accuracy but for all other clauses including clause intrusion into grief or shock the complaint must be made by the person directly affected or their authorised representative not always feasible in the aftermath of a killing janey starling codirector for level up said fatal domestic abuse is a public health issue just like suicide we have strong press regulation on reporting suicide its time ipso strengthened its editors code to state the precautions needed when reporting fatal domestic abuse charlotte dewar chief executive of ipso said the report rightly recognises the important role the media plays in raising awareness and helping public understanding of domestic abuse but shows that more could be done to raise awareness of the ways ipso can support families we look forward to working with level up and others to support families affected the headline of this piece was amended on december to
