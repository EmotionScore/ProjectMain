there can be little doubt that was a watershed year for feminism the niggling sense that women had been shortchanged became a conversation which grew into a roar as rebecca solnit put it on this very site feminism in was loud discordant and maybe transformative because important things were said not necessarily new but said more emphatically by more of us and heard as never before well id like to offer a hopeful prediction if was the year women made their voices heard will be the year women take to the streets its the next natural step for this new wave of feminism and it cant come soon enough in fact over the last few weeks ive seen the green shoots of feminisms next phase emerging because ive taken up invitations to attend the meetings of a new feminist direct action group called sisters uncut the name sisters uncut is a deliberate nod to uk uncut the anticuts direct action network founded in a few of the founding members of sisters uncut cut their teeth organising protests with uk uncut and they believe uk uncuts organising model where the foundation of one uk uncut group in london inspired dozens of autonomous uk uncut groups to set up around the country is the perfect way of setting up networked direct action feminist groups across britain sisters uncut focuses specifically on protecting domestic violence services and a lot of its members work for domestic violence charities and prevention services to that end it has very specific thorough and achievable demands for the government as well as the obvious demand for domestic violence services to be protected from cuts the group also calls for specialist domestic violence services for lgbt women bme women and so on guaranteed access to legal aid for women experiencing domestic violence access to safe and secure social housing for women fleeing domestic violence the end of panic rooms being classified as a spare room under the bedroom tax and for the safety of victims not to be subject to immigration status sisters uncut holds public womenonly which includes trans and intersex women meetings once a week and in doing so has managed to create a feminist activist community the atmosphere of the meetings is so galvanising supportive and radical that theyre almost addictive while meetings are mainly focused upon organising protests against cuts to domestic violence feminist politics is debated and by no means agreed upon by attendees in a spirit of kindness and respect watching the meetings unfold is like witnessing a tangible feminist movement come into being especially with regards to the effect sisters uncut has had upon survivors of domestic violence as one member put it its very liberating to acknowledge there are survivors among us and that were allowed to exist as survivors to have voice the group has allowed survivors and women who havent been victims of that particular crime to stand up together publicly and noisily sisters uncut has shown its members that womenonly feminist organising groups are both powerful and empowering and as a result the meetings themselves feel like a political act of course womenonly organising spaces are not new sisters uncut has been founded in the shadow of pioneering groups of previous generations such as the suffragettes and the women of greenham common more recent feminist groups like the uk feminista and east london feminists have emerged as fourthwave feminism has gained momentum but sisters uncut is possibly the first contemporary feminist group to focus upon direct action and to deliberately choose an organising structure that can be easily replicated around the country the founders seem to want to coax nascent feminists away from the internet and into rooms together so they can eventually take to the streets sisters uncut is holding its first womenonly protest against cuts to domestic violence services on valentines day in central london and members are currently in the process of building a website of resources so that women around the country can set up sisters uncut groups of their own i asked a sisters uncut founder frida what had inspired the women to form the group we were horrified that domestic violence services were being decimated by austerity and felt it was a result of the fact that women are generally treated as secondclass citizens whose needs are relegated so we decided the only thing to do was to organise ourselves and go out onto the streets and make ourselves heard a simple message then women are important our lives matter and feminism just got interesting,2015-01,little doubt

all over america pregnant women get a raw deal from their employers but the lowwage airport workers of america who ive met through my work as a researcher for a labor union bear the brunt of it take the example of angie who in the spring of was cleaning planes for a subcontractor of a commercial airline she was eight months pregnant and happy to have the job in a struggling economy but her employer does not offer maternity leave she only got paid as long as she worked she was determined to continue to earn money but one day bending over to pick up a fallen piece of paper she felt the first pangs a sharp piercing to her side then the rush of her water breaking she muttered a prayer beads of sweat dropping to her lips the pain shot urgently from her navel to her ankles she felt her pants and panties grow damp with water it was time she needed to push though angie nearly gave birth on the job her employers stance on pregnancy and reasonable accommodations did not change one bit in the summer of angies coworker sheila a sixmonthspregnant cabin cleaner was working with two other coworkers to clean a plane between flights one person took the front of the plane another cleaned the overheads and sheila did the lavatories the ventilation on the plane was cut off and it was f outside on the tarmac the lead cabin cleaner hollered at them to hurry up saying that they needed to complete the job in seven minutes or the flight would be late and they would all get written up sheila said she was trying her coworker stood up for her and said hey dont you see that shes pregnant and the supervisor said so angie worked all the way up until she had her baby there is a case on the supreme courts docket that could change lives like sheilas and angies the plaintiff is peggy young who worked as a united parcel service ups driver in maryland in she submitted a request for light duty because she was pregnant her manager asked for a doctors note and her doctor gave her one stating that she could not lift more than lbs ups declared her unfit to perform her job since the terms of her employment stipulated that she needed to be able to lift up to lbs at all times though her daily duties never required it they laid her off and discontinued her insurance meanwhile accommodations were made for her male colleagues when they sustained injuries off the job like while playing sports the supreme court heard her arguments in december they expect to give a ruling early this year the technical question at the heart of the case is quite straightforward do pregnant employees deserve to be accommodated in the same ways in which people that are injured off the job are accommodated people assume that because the united states has had a pregnancy discrimination act to for years discrimination against pregnant women is a thing of the past it isnt the pregnancy discrimination act was put in place to protect women from getting terminated for being pregnant and also to protect their wages but to date it hasnt spoken to issues of lightduty accommodation or maternity leave in fact pregnancy discrimination complaints are on the rise particularly among women in lowerwage jobs and among women of color like angie and sheila from to the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc reported that pregnancy discrimination complaints increased by employers still often refuse to make reasonable accommodations such as allowing pregnant women to carry a water bottle take bathroom breaks or sit while providing customer service that would enable them to keep working as a result many women are forced out of their jobs even though they are willing and able to work through their pregnancies and according to the most recent data of women in the united states who gave birth in a oneyear period also worked during that time in fact in every single state in the majority of women who gave birth in a oneyear period were in the labor force numerous studies have shown linkages between preterm birth low birth weight and miscarriage for women who face difficult working conditions including shift work and night work physically demanding working postures for at least three hours per day work that results in wholebody vibrations psychosocial stress at work physically demanding work and prolonged standing and high cumulative work fatigue the persistence of pregnancy discrimination in the workplace puts the financial stability and health of these women their babies and their entire families at risk sheila told me that when she got home that day after the supervisor yelled at her to hurry up she had cramps she sat quietly breathing little soothing sounds to herself clenching and pushing and breathing she hid in the bathroom until her husband came home and then he rushed her to their car and to the hospital where she had a miscarriage she told me that she endured three levels of pain that day the pain of the miscarriage the pain of not fighting back at work and the pain of all the blame she gave herself and then shortly thereafter she had to go back to work,2015-01,america pregnant woman get raw deal employer lowwage airport worker america ive

when a writer like new york magazines jonathan chait feels it necessary to whine in print about his and other mostly wellremunerated writers inability to write offensive tripe without consequence i think boofuckinghoo get a real problem a man in the uk tried to kill three women because he was a virgin and thought of them as a more weaker part of the human breed another man who gave a thumbs up to the camera as he sexually assaulted canadian teen rehteah parson who later killed herself was given probation and here in the us republicans tried to pass a week abortion ban that would only allow for rape and incest victims to access abortion services if they had first reported the crimes to police and thats just this month and just about women off the top of my head it is in that environment that chait wants us to take seriously and without any offense his weighty serious mindbaubles on everything from race relations to his frustration that rape laws are supposedly too strict and now his handwringing over imaginary affronts to white liberal mens ability to speak freely by which he means without women or people of color getting mad at him feminism might be dominating many conversations but sexism is still horrific and while there is a good conversation to be had over how ideological oneupmanship and call out culture impacts rigorous debate that is not the conversation chait is starting chait conflates real incursions on speech a university of michigan student who was harassed and intimidated after he published what was seen as an offensive newspaper column for example and simple forms of activism like signing a petition to keep a speaker off campus most of the acts that chait says are perverting liberalism are acts of free speech themselves discussions of racial microaggressions hashtag campaigns and even complaints from women of color about racism on a facebook group it seems the only kind of speech chait thinks should be free is the kind he agrees with he also paints proponents of this pcness as hysterical overreactors while simultaneously misrepresenting and hyping up his own examples of free speech supposedly under attack it would be ironic if it wasnt so intellectually dishonest chait for example cites rippatriarchy as a hashtag created by kneejerk feminists in response to hanna rosins book to lampoon her thesis in fact the hashtag was directly responsive to an excerpt of her book on slate entitled the patriarchy is dead feminists accept it she rhetorically killed it off so the lampooners mourned its death rosin an author writer at the atlantic and a host of one of slates popular gabfest podcasts who has appeared the colbert report the daily show and given a ted talk told chait for his article the price is too high you feel like there might be banishment waiting for you if only everyone using hashtags to make fun of her had access to such banishment chaits real problem it seems is that he doesnt understand why his privilege or anyone elses should impact how people perceive what he says under pc culture the same idea can be expressed identically by two people but received differently depending on the race and sex of the individuals doing the expressing he writes well yes context matters and its no secret that a man using a word like cunt for example often has a completely different resonance than when a woman uses it his willful ignorance about why he a white hetero cisgender man might not be able to use all the words or claim authority on every single topic is also why his er mansplanation of mansplaining allpurpose term of abuse that can be used to discredit any argument by any man falls flatter than his argument that it would be more equitable for women to live in squalor than demand that their husbands do a fair share of the housework if the worst thing that chaits version of pcness has wrought is that folks occasionally feel uncomfortable when they do and say terrible things i can live with that and he should too we are finally approaching a critical mass of interest in ending racism misogyny and transphobia and the ways they are ingrained into our institutions instead of rolling our eyes at the intensity of the feelings people have over these issues we should be grateful that they care so much because racism misogyny and transphobia can and do kill people if the price we all pay for progress for the less privileged is that someone who is more privileged gets their feelings hurt sometimes or that they might have to think twice before opening their mouths or putting their fingers to keyboards thats a small damn price to pay thats not stopping free speech its making our speech better,2015-01,writer like new york magazine jonathan chait feel necessary whine print mostly

victims of crime feel let down and ignored by the criminal justice system despite repeated government promises to improve its performance the victims commissioner has warned in her first review of compliance with the victims code lady newlove said those who had complained about their experiences were still receiving inadequate attention her comments are politically damaging since the conservative and labour parties are vying with one another to offer greater support for those who find themselves caught up in police investigations and prosecutions newlove became a campaigner for reforming youth culture after her husband garry newlove was kicked to death outside their home in warrington by youths who were vandalising her car she was appointed victims commissioner in victims told me that they felt staff failed to show warmth compassion empathy and patience newlove said they felt they were not treated as individuals and that the responses lacked any personal touch it is shocking how many victims told me how ignored dismissed and confused they felt when they tried to raise concerns about their treatment all it takes is basic human decency to explain to a victim in a sensitive and timely way why something has gone wrong and what they can do about it i have seen excellent examples of work by agencies across the country but its clear that many victims are still not getting the service they deserve the page report drew on the experiences of more than victims it calls for clear information from agencies and service providers on how they support victims updates on the progress of their complaints and information about how to pursue claims with the parliamentary and health service ombudsman criminal justice agencies should give mandatory training for all staff who deal with victims complaints and demonstrate how complaints from victims have led to improvements in service the report quotes several victims one said im just frightened i think they will harass me if i complain about the way they have treated me and my daughter another victim described how daunting the complaints process was i raised concerns about the process the process was almost worse than the actual journey of being a victim the ministry of justice stressed that some of newloves recommendations had already been put into effect ministers are planning to draw up a victims law for the next parliament and to create a single unified website advising victims on where to lodge their complaints the department said it aims to double spending on aid to victims from m to m a year through increases in the victim surcharge which is levied in courtroom fines the victims minister mike penning said i want to put the highest emphasis on the needs of victims and an important part of that is making sure the criminal justice system always listens to what they have to say and treats them with the utmost respect and sensitivity to help achieve this i have already committed to enshrining their rights in law we have also significantly strengthened their entitlements in the victims code and are reviewing whether new powers are needed so that they can better hold the system to account we are also soon launching the firstever onestop shop for all the information they might need as it is currently scattered across different organisations and pages of the internet i welcome baroness newloves dedication and hard work supporting my goal to make the system better for victims she recommends many sensible new standards in this important report which i will carefully consider sadiq khan mp the shadow justice secretary said this report by the governmentappointed victims commissioner is a damning indictment of the way victims and witnesses have been let down by david camerons government we cannot go on treating victims as an afterthought or worse still ignoring them altogether victims losing confidence in our justice system leads to crimes going unreported and witnesses not providing evidence if victims give up on reporting matters and helping in prosecutions it could lead to the wheels of our justice system grinding to a halt leaving criminals roaming the streets we are clear that more needs to be done which is why the next labour government will introduce the countrys firstever victims law the labour party has established a victims taskforce led by the former director of public prosecutions and labour candidate sir keir starmer qc lady lawrence and former chief constable peter neyroud it is due to report shortly,2015-01,victim crime feel let

in the summer of yearold cheryl strayed carrying a backpack nearly half her weight embarked on a solo mile trek along the pacific crest trail the pct stretches across nine mountain ranges from the californiamexico border to canada strayed said she was hoping for a transformative experience that would make me into the woman i knew i could become and turn me back into the girl id once been seventeen years later strayed published her memoir wild which details her experience of hiking alone for two months and the poignant life events the death of her mother and subsequent divorce from her husband of six years that propelled her journey the book spent months on and off the new york times bestseller list and has now been been turned into a movie produced by and starring reese witherspoon who has been nominated for a best actress oscar so far the film has earned m worldwide and has ignited what has been termed the wild effect inspiring people to hit the pct it has also turned strayed into a feminist icon critics have accused hollywood of continuing sexism for snubbing the film from a nomination in the best picture category at the oscars this year but wild perhaps already wins as the most feminist film of between the frankness of strayeds sexual encounters and the brutal blood and blisters incurred during her epic hike the fact that the story hangs on a single female performance focused on a feat of physical and mental strength is remarkable in itself it wasnt popular in my generation to be a feminist says strayed now from her home in portland oregon theres a whole lot of women in my generation who said well im not a feminist but and i always think if you enjoy wearing pants youre a feminist because that is a right fought for by feminists by women who came before you as an adolescent strayeds existence was far from what you would expect of a fledgling womens rights champion she was captain of the cheerleading team and homecoming queen the life i led as a teenager was at great odds with my actual identity who i knew i was and my beliefs she says it was just that i needed to be loved and so that was pretty much the only way for a small town girl from northern minnesota to gain acceptance and love to be the cute blond person i pretended to be what was she interested in at the time i was an avid reader i was much smarter than anyone assumed and much more ambitious one tangible marker for her political beliefs was a subscription to ms magazine the other was as she says just the life i had i saw my mom being beaten by my father many countless times and i also saw what it took for her to gather her strength and leave him and how hard it was for her as a single mother of three kids without any support at all from the culture or my father or her family she really was a heroic person and i recognised that as a little girl in an early chapter of wild strayed writes about the challenges of shedding socially constructed notions of femininity while travelling along the pct id been a girl for ever after all familiar with and reliant upon the powers my very girliness granted me suppressing those powers gave me a gloomy twinge in the gut strayed says she worked hard to get that passage of the book right its a really interesting part of being a woman especially a young woman and especially somebody who has been conventionally attractive i think most young women go through this experience im just fascinated by the fact that the main power we grant young women in our culture is the power of their beauty and sexual appeal to men and we also punish them for cashing in on it and admitting to it before the pct strayed often fell back on that traditional female power out on the trail she felt stripped of it i didnt have any of the artifice that goes with looking as my sexy self in the worldi was instead shorn clean really just in my stinky hiker clothes it was good for me it had to do with learning how to rely on myself other ways to feeling comfortable or accepted or valid in the world of men another scene from the book details her confiding to a therapist how she has sex like a man detached you could argue that this is not a genderspecific state of mind i couldnt agree more she says i think absolutely the way female sexuality has been expressed and essentially allowed to exist in a public way is all about love and emotion and attachment so when i say to that therapist im more like a man sexually im really speaking more to the cultural norms and expectations about male and female sexuality i wasnt saying there arent any women like me i was saying maybe we need to have a wider view of what it means to be a women when it comes to sex for strayed the most important line in wild came during a conversation with her mother bobbi lambrecht shortly after learning she was dying of cancer she said to me ive never been in the driver seat of my own life ive always been somebodys daughter or mother or wife and it was her deepest regret at the time of the diagnosis her mother was on the cusp of taking control she had enrolled in the same college strayed attended majoring in womens studies and history lambrecht died aged before she could finish her degree when my mother went to college she could see her life in a broader context she got married at because she was pregnant because abortion was not legal her life had been defined by that single motherhood strayed knew her life would be different my work as her daughter was to always be a person in the driver seat its the story of feminism its always women hoping to make it better for the next generation of women wild is out now in cinemas across the uk,2015-01,summer yearold cheryl strayed carrying backpack nearly half weight

sexism is certainly nauseating the disgusting leers on the street the discrimination the violence but those everyday expressions of misogyny could be seriously impacting our mental health as well a study published this month in the journal sex roles reveals that some of the sexism women face from catcalling and sexual harassment to sexual objectification and violence makes women generally more fearful and anxious the researchers from the university of missourikansas and georgia state university found a substantive link between physical safety concerns and psychological distress we already know that violence causes trauma and that people who are bullied and harassed are more likely to be depressed throughout their lives research shows that children who live in violent neighborhoods are more prone to developing ptsd and that the daily fear they experience changes their psychological makeup so drastically that nightmares flashbacks and disassociation are common we even know that racism has a demonstrable impact not only on the mental health of people of color but on their physical health as well yet despite the preponderance of evidence showing that violent and harassing environments cause emotional distress and can lead to mental illness we still have no name for what happens to women living in a culture that devalues and allows men to abuse them without consequence what does living with the fear of rape do to your mental wellbeing over time what diagnosis do you give to the shaking hands you cant stop after a stranger whispers pussy in your ear on your way to work and what about those of us who endure the same daily gauntlet of discriminations and threats of gendered violence without really feeling anything because its so routine what hoops did our brains have to jump through to get to ambivalence is it really more normal not to be anxious when i spoke to dr laurel b watson an assistant professor at the university of missourikansas city and one of the researchers in the study she told me that one of the hurdles in studying the impact that sexism has on womens mental health is that women have normalized this fear and anxiety so completely for example she said i went for a jog recently and i saw a guy in a van and if i jogged past him he could have opened the door and snatched me watson told me i had an immediate response to move to the other side of the van or to change my direction i didnt think twice about it its normalized but it has such an effect on your life women constrain their behaviors every day this fear and anxiety that women experience isnt simply anecdotal women are more likely than men to experience depression and were twice as likely to have an anxiety disorder something watsonwho has a degree in counseling psychology says is absolutely related to living with misogyny over time existing in a state of hypervigilance has a negative impact and leads to a higher level of psychological distress she explained watson also pointed out that the impact is much greater on women of color who live with a different historical legacy of objectification and sexual violence mental health issues are still widely stigmatized but remain incredibly serious they can be debilitating lead to serious physical symptoms and increase the risk of selfharm watson would like to see more studies done bigger studies that pay close attention to the way that sexuality race and other identities also impact mental health so would i we need to identify the link between sexism and mental health with great enough certainty that people can start to see sexism as more than just a cultural and political problem when they concede that sexism is a problem at all theres no vaccination we can get or drug we can take to lessen the impact that sexism has on womens everyday lives but perhaps recognizing just how sick it is making us and that the damage it causes runs deep we can start to convince others to take sexism and the misogyny behind it more seriously,2015-01,sexism certainly nauseating disgusting leer street discrimination violence everyday expression misogyny could seriously impacting mental health well study

out for dinner on an overseas business trip thousands of miles from the uk isobel answered the call on her mobile expecting to speak to her children instead she heard the voice of her estranged husband whom she was in the process of divorcing after years of violence in which she had been punched kicked strangled pulled around by her hair and thrown down the stairs before the children came on the line he told me exactly where i was which city in which country and which restaurant i was sitting in she says i was absolutely beside myself i was just so overwhelmed with fear wondering how the hell he could pinpoint me like this i asked how he knew and he said i can find you on your iphone mark had bought the phone for isobel who is in her s and set it up before she left him it seems likely he was using the geolocation services built into all smartphones if you know or can guess the password to someones cloud account you can follow their movements constantly via the software designed to find lost or stolen phones that comes installed on many devices that isnt all a smartphone offers if you want to monitor someones activity spyware allows you to listen in to and record calls read texts see photos and even watch your subject via their phones camera last week catharine higginson a yearold teacher from surrey revealed how her husband james had been tracking her texts and conversations via an app on her phone she was initially shocked she said but didnt see it as spying instead interpreting jamess actions as a mark of his concern for her wellbeing higginson may be happy with her lot but there are growing numbers of women like isobel for whom the opportunities offered by smartphones for tracking and surveillance are nothing short of terrifying abusers are increasingly using this technology say domestic violence charities for women experiencing domestic violence these technologies can be used to further terrorise and intimidate them says sandra horley the chief executive of refuge online tools and mobile technologies can provide yet another way for perpetrators to exert power and control over women a womens aid survey found that of respondents partners or expartners used their online activities to track them refuges whose locations are kept closely guarded for the safety of their users now often warn women fleeing abuse to check their phones for apps that might be spyware and to switch off location services before they arrive tracey noble refuge manager for the dash domestic abuse stops here charity in east berkshire and south buckinghamshire has seen at least three women in the past year who came from other refuges because they had been found there by their abusers via their phones they have helped a woman who had been traced at three previous refuges new technology is being developed so quickly and social media pervades so many aspects of our lives that it is hard to stay ahead says jennifer perry the chief executive of the digital trust which supports victims of digital abuse in fact spyware she reckons is yesterdays technology for tracking victims the easiest thing is to access the woman in the cloud a man might buy a phone and set it up for his partner to be helpful he knows the username and password you have women who dont even realise they have a cloud account in their smartphone there is also an app you can buy that mirrors the phone on to a pc the man can just sit at his computer and watch everything that happens on the phone the technology is cheap and accessible she says and evading it is often not as simple as just turning the phone off perry usually advises women to take their sim card out leave the phone with a friend until it can be cleaned and use a cheap payasyougo device in the meantime but if her expartner owns the phone it will never be safe cloud storage is particularly problematic because it is linked to laptops and pcs which unlike phones can have spyware installed on them remotely via email you often find that a woman had spyware put on to her computer remotely so even if she changes the username and password for the cloud on her phone the abuser can see that on the computer and get back in perry says perpetrators dont just use this technology to find out where an escaping partner has gone it is another tool for abuse when theyre together too they will use the information to belittle or threaten the woman says clare laxton public policy manager at womens aid theyll say why were you at this restaurant youre cheating on me im going to kill myself it closes down that womans space so she wont want to go out and socialise because she knows the abuse shell get when she gets home isnt worth it its all part of controlling her as much as possible laxton believes the new offence of coercive and controlling behaviour being introduced by the home secretary theresa may will be important for policing such patterns of abuse these sorts of behaviours are exactly what it is aiming to capture she says fiona says her exhusband somehow managed to get all her emails to appear on his phone during their relationship when she asked him to leave after eight years of abuse he followed her with a video camera repeatedly broke into her house when she was out and confronted her with evidence when she started seeing someone else a friend advised her to check her phone and her ex admitted he had been tracking her using location services he could see where i was to within a metre she says i didnt even realise that was possible its a really horrible feeling to think that someone who has been violent towards you who absolutely hates you knows exactly where you are my exhusband was a local businessman whose image was important to him he was not going to do something overt this technology gives people like him such a huge toolbox to intimidate their victims the police investigated the violence isobel suffered but the cps decided not to prosecute saying the fact that she had started divorce proceedings meant securing a conviction would be hard the prosecutors fear the police explained to her was that the case would look like a messy divorce when she and her children had moved to a new address that was kept secret from her exhusband he left an ipod for them at their school it was linked to his computer and all the location services were enabled isobel opened it at the school but was devastated to think he could have found out where they were mark still sends devices such as tablets to his children and the tracking is always on i get them all wiped says isobel who has been supported by refuge its sad for the kids because sometimes there are things on there that hes paid for that they want but its too much of a risk but knowing how to deal with the practical side of the technology doesnt lessen the psychological impact i feel like im some sort of crazy woman who is totally paranoid and thats not how i normally conduct my life isobel says im a rational sane person but that is taken away from me along with my freedom to be myself and be the parent i want to be i feel trapped names in this article have been changed,2015-01,dinner

most violent men who participate in reform programs stop physically harming their partners a landmark british study has found prompting the chief executive of an australian male violence prevention association to call for an urgent update of similar programs here the fiveyear research project known as mirabal was run through the domestic violence organisation respect it examined programs attended by men voluntarily or through referral by a partner court or social services before their partner entered the program almost all of the women in the study reported being physically or sexually assaulted in the previous three months but once their partner or expartner had completed the program most women reported that the physical and sexual violence stopped women who reported having a weapon used against them dropped from to zero while those who said they were slapped punched or had something thrown at them fell from to rodney vlais the chief executive of no to violence a victorian organisation working with men to end their violence and abuse against family members said the report was particularly relevant to australia this week the victorian government released an extract of the terms of reference for the royal commission into family violence the first inquiry of its type in australia and calls to end an epidemic of violence against women have been growing the system in australia has a lot of similarities to the way the programs work in the uk and what this report shows is accredited domestic violence perpetrator programs can be successful not only in reducing physical and sexual violence but also in reducing other ways men limit their partners and expartners vlais said the research shows of course not all men change and we have to be realistic and not look at these programs through rosecoloured glasses but with the ultimate goal of safety of women and children and giving them their lives back free from control and abuse this research shows it is definitely worth investing in accredited programs he said australia has no such accredited programs while vlais said there were minimum standards for perpetrator rehabilitation programs in some australian states and territories these programs were rarely audited in victoria the minimum standard guidelines for these programs are years old and while theyre a bit more updated in nsw there is no active process for evaluating these programs in depth these services hold promise but evaluation every couple of years is critical because this is complex and tricky work we must develop a national accreditation system here in australia the coronial inquest into the death of yearold luke batty killed by his father on a cricket oval in tyabb victoria revealed victims often felt the onus was on them to seek counselling rather than on the perpetrator to reform and attend rehabilitation vlais was on a panel of family violence experts that gave evidence to that inquest the uk research revealed men who took part in rehabilitation programs didnt have a single light bulb moment that led to them change he said rather there were a series of moments throughout the course of the programs and what that means is the work must go on for long enough because men wont change through a brief threemonth program he said the programs which were successful liaised with victims as well as police courts and social services so that information was shared if for example a man breached a nocontact order while taking part in the program importantly the research found domestic violence perpetrator reform programs do not replace the need for a strong judicial and police system mental health programs parenting programs and intervention orders vlais said we wouldnt want to see services like this take away from the need for a sufficiently strong criminal justice approach and we dont want courts to assume that just because a man has participated in such a program he is fixed he said men who believe they need help can contact the mens referral service on the national sexual assault domestic and family violence counselling service respect can be reached on,2015-01,violent men participate reform

i am a woman i am a feminist and it took me years to admit that someone i loved was a sexual predator this isnt easy to acknowledge but it feels especially important after a year marked by several high profile accusations of sexual assault and domestic violence almost every case featured public scrutiny of the accusers history and values and motivations almost every case featured a woman who choses to publicly stand by the accused many other women responded with shock and disappointment why would any woman defend a rapist how could any smart confident woman be in such denial the public refusal to believe rape accusations is harmful to all women and it casts a shadow on rape victims all over the world but as appalling as it is to refuse to believe a woman who has been so brutally violated i cannot help but feel some empathy with the disbelievers because when a close family member of mine who ill call steve was accused and convicted of sexual assault i refused to believe it my father had left for nigeria when i was two years old and my brother was six months old and as we grew up steve was what we imagined a cool dad would be like he was funny he swore he played pranks he always had time for us when it seemed like all the other adults had more important things to do the first time steve was arrested for sexual assault was in when i was seven years old i remember little more than visiting him in prison talking to him through the glass nobody talked about why he was there when he was released three years later we all acted as if nothing had happened steve went back to being the ticklemonster and the prankster in the family he babysat me we went to disneyland together three years later he was arrested again this time for a particularly violent rape of a prostitute after his second arrest i was old enough to know what was going on his parents frantically scraped up every dollar they could for his defence emptying their retirement accounts and selling their house they were confident that the truth would win out and people would see that steve was the victim of a vindictive woman steves parents were kind and loving people but these charges brought out a shocking side to them that whore steves dad would say that lying whore when the victim showed up to court covered in cuts and bruises and her neck in a brace steves parents argued to us that it was a ruse the bruises were makeup the neck brace was for show my mom who hadnt even been particularly close to steve believed all of their stories and justifications she never said anything to vilify the victim but she would say that something about it just didnt seem right when steve was convicted for rape for the second time and sentenced to years in prison we still didnt believe that our steve was capable of something so monstrous his parents cried every day over the injustice of the system my brother and i sent letters and pictures to him in prison he made us little gifts in return and we treasured them i dreamed that the police would realise they had made a mistake and he could come home i would wake up crying i missed him desperately nobody ever talked about the first conviction nobody ever discussed the charges that led to his year stint we didnt tell any of the extended family where he was even after i grew up got married and had kids i still didnt believe steve was a rapist so when he was released i greeted him with open arms we had a party i painted a banner one evening a few years later we were all at a family dinner somehow his jail time came up in conversation that whore his dad whispered everybody quietly nodded and changed the subject after dinner i drove home with my brothers thenwife and i realized she was shaking with rage i didnt understand she finally turned to me and said do you realize that he just called a rape victim a whore she looked at her two little girls in the backseat and i did too i finally realised what this looked like to an outsider what i had been condoning all these years all to preserve the fantasy of a man who never existed all to keep from realising that my love had been wasted on someone who was the embodiment of everything i stood against what a failure of a family we were to enable this man and to put a roof over his head while he was victimising women i cant imagine how people must have shaken their heads at us as we refused to believe a woman covered in injuries and how terrified they must have been to have us in their neighbourhood we must have seemed absolutely delusional to deny that there was anything behind not only one but two rape convictions how heartless we must have looked to call a rape victim a whore its terrifying that we never questioned it i no longer have any relationship with steve the man i see now has tainted every memory of the man i once knew his mother to this day rages at the system that unfairly locked him away and she still supports him financially and emotionally i think that admitting that the baby she rocked in her arms grew into a monster would kill her it would strip away every year and every day that she had poured her love and devotion into him we have to believe victims even if we are hurt and ashamed by what they say its necessary to face that pain and that shame in order to protect the innocent and get justice for those who have been harmed the pain and heartbreak that the families of rapists face should never be an excuse for turning your back on victims and i know just how devastating acknowledging the truth can be,2015-01,woman feminist took year admit someone loved wa sexual predator isnt easy acknowledge feel especially important year marked several high profile accusation sexual assault domestic violence almost every case featured public scrutiny accuser history value motivation almost every case featured woman choses publicly stand accused many woman responded shock disappointment would woman defend rapist could smart

feminist cries for action have seen a resurgence of late notably in calls for quotas on company boards large numbers of very successful women feel that life is profoundly sexist and unfair feminism has always and inevitably been driven by the educated and wellconnected but todays feminists are also obsessed with their own elite metropolitan lives this is deeply depressing it is also having a pernicious effect on politicians and policymaking take the club the campaign for at least of board members in large public companies to be female this has attracted huge publicity and traction top women campaign for it politicians line up to sing the importance of such diversity it is received wisdom that this policy is good for women in general and important to them and also good for the benighted companies themselves this is simplistic and it is nonsense a number of countries have introduced quotas for large public companies but only one to date has enacted major sanctions for miscreants and has a good many years experience with quotas that is norway where representation is required and enforced and the result the policy has done nothing whatsoever for the female labour market generally it has had no impact on female pay and promotion prospects in the companies concerned it has had no positive impact on company profits either replacing privileged men with privileged women doesnt seem to pay any diversity benefits what norway now has is a new group of golden skirts a small group of women who are very rich indeed as a feminist cause boardroom quotas ought to be a bust in fact they are of a piece with much of the modern feminist media a combination of elite selfinterest and preoccupation with imagery the coalition governments most recent reshuffle seems to have been driven overwhelmingly by a desire to get more women on the front benches in prime photographic position and one has some sympathy given the constant criticism of any government which doesnt focus on its female numbers politicial parties need to have members from a wide variety of backgrounds if they are to understand and reflect their nations concerns but that is a very different thing from a relentless focus on female numbers all female shortlists for parliament are another favourite but why should it be so good for women or indeed society to give seats to women who are mostly middle class and oxbridge educated at the expense of middleclass and mostly oxbridge men it isnt even a vote winner there is no evidence whatsoever that women ever vote for a candidate simply because of her gender the past halfcentury has been amazing for highly educated women for them professional success is the new normality true only a small number of ftse companies have female chief executives but in the rich countries club of the oecd half of the wellpaid professional and managerial class jobs are now held by women and women are a growing majority of university students it is a victory over historic discrimination but it also means that the female elite is increasingly different from other women class trumps gender and inequality among women is rising much faster than inequality among men that is partly because successful women started from behind when many careers were barred to women their earnings were more equal as doors opened some womens earnings pulled away but there is another reason too modern elites depend on cheap labour elites always have done and this hasnt changed just because the elites are now coed once successful men were catered for by female servants and by their fulltime wives those wives are now out there carving their own careers but the female servants are still very much in place some of them are inside the home but many are outside today we employ huge numbers of nannies and cleaners we also employ millions and millions of nursery assistants care assistants dishwashers and housekeepers armies of women doing traditional female tasks nurseries and care homes are big sectors and we outsource most of what we once did in kitchens at home fewer and fewer meals are prepared at home workers in these sectors are lowpaid they are part of the service economy which underpins professional lives they are also overwhelmingly female sisterhood is dead different women have very different lives and interests but i wish that feminist voices spent more time speaking about the millions of lowpaid female employees on whom elite lives depend and less about boardrooms and westminster and that as the general election approaches politicians seeking womens votes would pay more attention to all womens lives and not just the view from the female summit,2015-01,feminist cry action seen resurgence late notably call quota company board large

mps across the political spectrum on tuesday welcomed the suns decision to no longer run images of topless models on page of the newspaper the education secretary nicky morgan who also holds the women and equalities brief said the move was long overdue and marked a small but significant step towards improving media portrayal of women and girls i very much hope it remains permanent the sun still refused to confirm the move on tuesday with a spokesman saying it is all just speculation it is all wild speculation but the groups sister title the times said last fridays edition would be the last to carry pictures of a topless model the labour mp for walthamstow stella creasy said the campaign to scrap page had opened up a discussion about the damage to society of objectifying women by featuring seminaked women so prominently in a national paper she told bbc radio s today programme on tuesday it wasnt about page being offensive but about the impact on our society of judging men and women by different standards and basically saying that we didnt need boobs with our breakfast tables the objectification of women in this way was basically saying to all of us what matters frankly were our breasts not our brains the move was also supported by lib dem womens and equalities minister jo swinson although she criticised the alternative content in tuesdays edition two hollyoaks actors in bikinis on a beach they were replaced by a tribute to the late coronation street actor anne kirkbride in later editions i am delighted that the old fashioned sexism of page could soon be a thing of the past swinson said i welcome this apparent step forward from the sun but i would encourage its editors to consider whether parading women in bikinis is really a modern reflection of the contribution women make to society the disappearance was also welcomed by the ukip mp douglas carswell im a father of a fiveyearold daughter i dont want her growing up in a country with that sort of thing said the former tory mp i think this is good news this is great asked if it matter that others in ukip might view it as political correctness gone mad carswell replied do you know what a lot of political correctness gone mad is actually politeness im pleased that this country is in some ways more pc that means that people of different backgrounds get on and thats a good thing shadow culture secretary harriet harman told lbc the move means the sun is moving into the st century while the girlguiding uks advocates panel said page is disrespectful and embarrassing and that they are thrilled it is being dropped caroline criadoperez who campaigned for a woman to appear on a banknote told the huffington post this has never been about nudity feminists are not scared of breasts the issue is one of how we perceive women what we believe they are capable of featuring a topless woman on page of a newspaper populated by images of powerful and fullydressed men perpetuates the idea that men do things and women have things done to them industry experts said page had deterred global brands from advertising in the paper and dropping it could lead to a boost in revenues disney and apple are among advertisers that had a policy of not buying display advertising in the sun with page the main issue of contention other companies said to largely avoid advertising in the sun for brand perception reasons include john lewis waitrose and the french cosmetics group loral with some brands there is not just a single reason for not advertising in the sun it is about the whole tabloid issue per se said one senior media industry executive but for some the scrapping of page represents the removal of a major barrier to entry conversations that wouldnt or couldnt happen before might become possible but the daily star issued a statement saying it would continue printing pictures of seminaked women page is as british as roast beef and yorkshire pud fish and chips and seaside postcards it said it decided to hammer home the difference with its rival boasting in thursdays edition of more topless women saying it was more fun than the sun last year the sun made about m in display advertising across its monday to friday editions according to unofficial figures pundits say it is difficult to estimate exactly how great the opportunity is to bring in antipage advertisers but that over time it could be worth a great deal if you can convert a new major advertiser each relationship will usually eventually turn into millions of pounds a year said one senior press advertising space buyer at a top uk media agency apple may be the toughest to convert the company has a longstanding policy of not advertising in not just the sun but also its redtop rivals as well as the midmarket daily mail and daily express for brand positioning reasons disney has also eschewed running display advertising in the sun for many years although the company does occasionally run promotions relating to its films which include blockbusters such as frozen it is understood that disney and the sun fell out recently about a number of instances of poor execution of promotions a separate issue to any concerns about page a spokesman for disney said the company does not have an official policy or list of media owners it does not run advertising in but several senior media industry figures said disney had an unwritten rule preventing advertising in publications such as the sun and the daily star when it comes to where we advertise broadcast our shows how we do promotions or license our products disney always considers the association with our brand said a spokesman for the walt disney company the suns move could put advertising from loral and john lewis which advertises in news uk stablemates the times and sunday times back on the table some clients when briefing us have kind of undertheradar reduced spend or give another reason for not wanting to run very much advertising in a title like say the sun said a second senior press buyer at a leading media agency the client wont spell it out officially but it is not difficult to see who spends less than who when they probably shouldnt be for some advertisers page was a big reason not to spend that reason has now been taken away daniel booth senior investment manager at havas media group said the move away from topless models on page was part of a modern repositioning of the sun brand the sun has slowly been rebranding itself since the controversy and closure of news of the world he said they have been repositioning it and this is the latest stage of that reinvention advertisers may not come into the fold overnight but this proves their dedication to change and shows they are a brand now more relevant to the time we live in rob lynam head of trading at media buying agency mec is less convinced that the removal of nude models will be an advertising cash cow for the sun i dont think it will make a huge amount of difference he said there are other reasons why advertisers stay away objections not just the existence of page it can be the overall editorial environment of a

its been over twenty years since thenbikini kill frontwoman and riot grrrl icon kathleen hanna scrawled the word slut across her stomach in the years since theres been a book called slut countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word slut and in thousands of women took to streets across the globe in antirape marches called slutwalks a reference to how victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them like cunt and bitch many feminists have long tried to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word slut and to give it new meaning increasingly though its seeming like we might not succeed any time soon take leora tanenbaum in she wrote slut growing up female with a bad reputation chronicling girls and womens experiences with the word she herself was called a slut as a high school student in the s long before the term sexual harassment was coined and told me i had no vocabulary to understand what happened now years later tanenbaum is about to publish another book i am not a slut because in part the sheen of reclaiming slut seems to have worn off over the years when she spoke to women who called themselves sluts with a positive and defiant spirit all told her the decision had turned against them later and all regretted it tanenbaum told me that when women are in closed circle or closeknit community like a protest with likeminded people or among friends who understand the cheeky appropriation of the word identifying as a slut can be empowering but what inevitably happens especially in todays digital culture where revenge porn stolen pictures and cyber harassment is the norm is that it always spills outwards for them it was an amazing feminist experience but it didnt last every single person i spoke to who intentionally embraced a slut persona ended up being treated terribly by people outside of her circle because the culture we live in is so dominated by the sexual double standard but beyond women who tried to reclaim slut for themselves other feminists have rightfully asked why we should all try to reclaim a word with so much baggage especially a word that impacts different women differently and brings them a lot more pain than righteous justice slutwalks for example are no longer the cause clbre they once were because some women of color spoke out against the ways in which the protests and the reclamation of slut focused on the ability of white women to simultaneously embrace the word and reject its meaning a group of black female academics activists and writers wrote an open letter explaining that as black women we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves slut without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the black woman is rutgers professor and writer brittney cooper wrote at the time to organize a movement around the reclamation of a term is in and of itself an act of white privilege in response some slutwalk organizers changed the name of their protests today while a handful of slutwalks remain the excitement over the movement has waned noticeably but women everywhere are still being actively physically hurt by the stereotypes that lead people to call them sluts just look to the high profile deaths of young women who were slutshamed and a mass shooting where the killer said he was targeting blonde sluts were still being targeted because of our identities and sexualities and it has perhaps appropriately put a damper on the oncecelebratory reclamation of the word maybe that the wounds inflicted by slut and the culture that encourages people to define women that way that we once hoped were superficial are just too raw and too deep maybe the speed of the internet is too fast for us to control a word with so much potential to damage theres a poster on my living room wall by artist favianna rodriguez that reads im a slut i vote so does everyone i sleep with and youre about to be more fucked than i am for me it captures the brash inyourface spirit that the feminist movement ive loved is known for but in this time of unprecedented feminist power the conversation about slut can be more reflective than fevered women who want to call themselves sluts shouldnt stop or be made to stop i love that women can embrace that which is meant to hurt them and find power in it but i also know that we can still claim our sexuality and agency without using a word meant to denigrate a word that still hurts so many people besides we dont need slut to tell us what we already know women have sex some people dont like that and were going to continue to do it anyway,2015-01,twenty year since thenbikini kill frontwoman riot grrrl icon kathleen hanna scrawled word slut across

nothing will be offlimits when australias first royal commission into family violence begins next month victorian premier daniel andrews has said andrews has revealed an extract of the terms of reference for the commission which lists prevention early intervention victim support and protection and perpetrator accountability as part of its scope andrews has promised to adopt every recommendation the commission makes family violence is the leading cause of death and disability for australian women under the age of according to the victorian government and the promise of a royal commission formed a key part of andrewss campaign in the leadup to his election in november on monday afternoon he told reporters that the commission would not be about proving there was a problem none of us need to be convinced there is a massive problem andrews said we know that for a fact and there is no debate and no doubt that we need to get on with fixing it this is about the unspeakable tragedies unfolding every hour of every day in every part of our state we are committed to this being a thorough and detailed process of inquiry about making practical recommendations for the future the commission should take no longer than months he said according to statistics from domestic violence victoria there was a increase in reports of family violence incidents to victoria police between and the number of family incident reports submitted by police rose from in to more than in highprofile murders of women and children have also highlighted the scale of the problem with many offenders found to have been on bail parole facing charges or deemed a low risk of harming again at the time of committing the crime in julie grant was murdered by her expartner shannon mahon who was on bail for assault last april fiona warzywoda was stabbed to death by her de facto husband who had a family violence order out against him last february kelly thompson was stabbed to death by her former partner who had frequently breached intervention orders in the same month greg anderson murdered his yearold son luke batty while facing criminal charges most of them domestic violence related there were women and eight children killed through family violence in the state in the year to november last year domestic violence victoria chief executive fiona mccormack said the terms of reference of the commission were encouraging because they placed emphasis on the perpetrators as well as early intervention its an outrageous situation at the moment where we ask women across the state to flee their homes every year because we cant keep them safe mccormack said and we know once they leave men will follow and stalk them the good thing about the terms of reference for this commission is that theyre comprehensive a whole range of agencies are involved and that will give it a much broader focus while also building on evidence we already have we need to take our approach to domestic violence into the next era to make it about how we gather intelligence systematically and share that information between a range of agencies to hold perpetrators to account and keep women safe it was important that the government had said the commission would run alongside other more immediate responses to family violence being implemented she said the royal commission into family violence will be led by justice marcia neave and will commence once the terms of reference have been signed off by the state governor,2015-01,nothing offlimits australia first royal commission family violence begin next

what drama on the gender wars front a committee of peers six women and seven men before you ask has scolded the broadcasters for their lack of women in news and current affairs programming while the ft paywall reports that leading women in the city are calling for quotas in senior management to break through a glass ceiling which is stuck below when the labour party went down the quotas road years ago to achieve greater gender balance in picking parliamentary candidates there was hell to pay mockery outrage even a failed lawsuit by a disgruntled male wannabe in west london quotas negative and positive never seem quite right in theory france germany and italy have them but do necessary work in practice so the tories and lib dems are still struggling to correct their mistake and it shows on the green leather benches and in cabinet as a bank of america exec tells todays ft everything the industry has tried for the last years hasnt really worked so why not try quotas well come back to them but first the icing on todays gender cake in most of the papers a judge is in trouble for not jailing stuart kerner a religious studies teacher in southeast london who had sexual intercourse with a yearold pupil if grooming is the right word to use it is she who groomed you you gave into temptation kerner was told before getting a suspended sentence no its not the right word even though most of us werent in court and therefore didnt hear the evidence you have to be there to understand some verdicts grooming is a loaded word it describes what predatory adults do as a host of recent nasty cases stretching back decades have reminded us the erring judge a yearold barrister of years experience was her honour judge joanna greenberg qc this weighty verdict dropped on a teenage girl was dropped by a woman outrage might well have been worse if it had been a male judge but the case simply proves that there are no panaceas in life the tabloids female columnists heres the mails jan moir have put the boot in the broadsheets are more delicate heres our own gaby hinsliff but they all seem to agree that the judges conduct is rightly being investigated theres evidence that bankers and other major corporations would indulge in less predatory and macho conduct all those pointless and costly takeovers all that dodgy risk if there were more women on the boards im inclined to think thats probably right but at least one woman on the northern rock board didnt stop that run on the bank in our quotabound neighbours are not free from human error either but in the end its a matter of fairness and an efficient use of the available talent pool as evidenced by the way all those backward muslim countries we can all name hobble themselves further by excluding women back to the broadcasters notably the bbc if the lord communications committee it includes the redoubtable joan bakewell and labours fierce baroness scotland has got its numbers right the ratio of men to women being interviewed as experts is and there are not enough mishal husains or kate silvertons what i think were seeing is what i was taught long ago to call a revolution of rising expectations middle class france in the pre years was the context in which i first encountered it but its often visible things are getting better hopes rise people see new opportunities and they want them now impatience is understandable though it does not always aid perspective nothing has improved in years i once heard a successful woman complain on a public platform the real danger in our fragile times id say is that hope gets downtrodden across the board for young men and women with aspirations great or small global conflict is a bigger risk than inequality said the davos forums global risk panel on thursday

canadian parents can get up to weeks leave at reduced pay when they first have children in serbia parents get weeks at full pay and in sweden where ive convinced myself the streets are lined with candy canes and it rains gumdrops moms and dads can share almost weeks of leave days of which is reserved for the father so while were applauding president obamas thursday announcement that hes directing federal agencies to give employees six weeks of paid parental leave and the move certainly does deserve applause lets not forget that the allowance is downright puny by international standards the united states has long been a global laughingstock for our awful policies for children and families were the only industrialized nation without paid maternity leave and our childcare system is archaic there are few options for children under kindergarten age and the cost of care has doubled in the last years these are not the numbers of a country that values working families but we do need to start somewhere and president obamas plan is a good first step and one that is long overdue as author and professor stephanie coontz wrote in even though percent of american children now live in households where every adult in the home is employed in the past years the united states has not passed any major federal initiative to help workers accommodate their family and work demands obamas directive will only require paid leave for federal employees but the president is also pushing congress to pass a bill that would make it easier for states to pay for their own family leave initiatives right now only three states california new jersey and rhode island offer residents paid family and medical leave the rest of us rely on the discretion of our workplaces for familyfriendly policies and for the most part they do not deliver only of the workplaces in the private sector cover the cost of childcare and have paid family leave but as vivien labaton and tracy sturdivant executive directors of the make it work campaign pointed out in response to obamas announcement there is much more left to do in order to help families the president will also need to take on equal pay and affordable child care and quickly our workplace laws are out of sync with the reality of todays working families labaton and sturdivant wrote in a statement and our policies need to sprint to catch up lets hope this is the starter gun for that sprint lets hope that this relatively tiny amount of leave as any parent could tell you six weeks is barely enough time to adjust to your new sleep schedule let alone having a new human in your life is the beginning of something much larger a move towards supporting families across the board because if americans really want to stand by our constant assertions that motherhood is the most important job in the world or that we want men to be involved parents too were going to need a lot more than six weeks were going to need child care that doesnt break the bank fair pay for child care workers equal pay for women and a national conversation on how to make sure childcare issues arent just womens issues until then ill dream of

feminists insist that the more women people of color and lgbt individuals are visible the better off and more egalitarian the world will be but is simple representation the best answer to sexism women are still scarce in many places of power theres a dearth of women in congress a lack of female experts on the sunday morning talk shows and a shortage of women ceos law partners and bylined reporters one scholar is even studying what the lack of women in comments sections does to the public debate the push for eventual parity however often means that the first women in traditionally male spaces be it politics gaming or even firefighting are saddled with the responsibility of taking abuse until a critical mass is reached and hopefully the culture shifts and of making that space more womanfriendly but why must women sign up to be professional vanguards in order to get the job they want as californias senator barbara boxer told liza mundy in a politico piece about the sexism women in congress face i never wanted to be a disruptor i wanted to be a legislator women still make up barely over of all legislators nationwide though in oklahoma and louisiana only of people in office are women and theres still only women of color in the house and only one sen mazie hirono in the senate and while we know that women legislators for example are more likely to support feminist and progressive policies its unclear if their presence in congress has had much impact on the behavior of their male colleagues or the continually sexist culture in politics judging by the outrageous sexism recounted in mundys article and senator kirsten gillibrands book last year that included her treatment by male coworkers it seems whatever progress has been made is happening at an unacceptably slow pace debbie walsh the director of the center for american women and politics at rutgers university tells me that we simply dont have enough women represented yet to know what a critical mass might do the fact that were still counting women is because theres not that many of them walsh says youre still looking at an institution that is overwhelmingly male its still the most exclusive mens club in the world she said any person breaking in to a space where theyre not of the dominant culture its hard walsh added take former fdny captain brenda berkman for example berkman was one of a group of women who sued the fire department for sex discrimination in and won she became one of the first women firefighters in new york city the harassment she faced was downright dangerous in addition to her male colleagues playing sexist pranks like covering her locker in a huge bra they also tampered with her protective equipment and drained her air tanks berkman has said they were sending a clear message your life might be at risk if you pursue this asking individual women to enter hostile spaces to make them better is really asking women to make men better and to make men better at womens own risk but it shouldnt be womens responsibility to fix men or deal with their misogyny instead men should be taking it upon themselves to treat women with respect and demand their other male colleagues do the same emily may executive director of the antistreet harassment organization hollaback told me the answer lies in representation but not representation alone we need to regularly ask underrepresented folks what would support look like to you and then develop concrete ongoing systems to provide that support that means if a female politicians want more bathrooms get them more bathrooms and lay off the potty jokes it also means developing support and training in nontraditional jobs for women and demanding that straight white men do as much to make spaces friendly for underrepresented groups as those groups themselves women and womens presence arent the only things that can end sexism and closing gender gaps is more than just a numbers game so lets look forward to the day we can stop counting,2015-01,feminist insist woman people color lgbt individual visible better egalitarian world simple representation best answer sexism woman still scarce many place power

what stops a man from beating up and raping his female partner according to research published today it is not sanctions imposed by the criminal justice system such as prison or probation but attending a course with other abusers domestic violence perpetrator programmes dvpps steps towards change by the feminist academics liz kelly and nicole westmarland is based on interviews with men who attend programmes that aim to reeducate them about their behaviour to improve the safety of women and children the research which also draws on the experiences of partners of the violent men a small number of children and the staff of these programmes finds that the vast majority of men who abuse their partners stop their physical and sexual violence if they attend a dvpp and that such programmes could play an important role in the quest to end domestic violence some of the figures look impressive for example before attending the programme a third of men asked women to perform sexual acts against their wishes but none did so after taking part cases of the men using a weapon against their partner reduced from to nil but there are other findings that give me cause for concern ninety per cent of the men interviewed had prior to the course made excuses about and attempted to justify their abusive behaviour after the course this tendency had barely reduced at all with almost threequarters of the men still making excuses over the years when making plain my scepticism about dvpps i have been told that the aim of such courses is to make perpetrators accountable and get them to face up to what they have done this finding shows that this is one of the weakest outcomes what about prevention of domestic violence does the existence of these courses deter others from using their fists to settle an argument on average two women in england and wales die each week as a result of domestic violence a figure that has remained constant for decades i cant imagine a governmentled information campaign with the slogan violent men beware beat up your wife and go on a course over half of the women reported feeling very safe after the programme compared with less than one in before it but that leaves almost half of the women still in fear one major tactic used by violent men is to control the household finances so that the woman is totally reliant on him and has no means of escape the research found that after dvpp this behaviour changed only marginally there is also some evidence that dvpps do not necessarily encourage women to leave violent men the researchers used a control group of women who were accessing support for domestic violence but whose partner was not attending a dvpp in order to compare results the control group also reported a significant reduction in violence from the men but were more likely to end the relationship with the abuser than the women whose partners were attending a dvpp perhaps such programmes act as marriage guidance counselling and help keep couples together is this not dangerous the impression given by the widespread acceptability of these programmes is that those who beat and rape their partners are in need of support and help not punishment there are moves by the home office to roll out restorative justice measures in cases of sexual and domestic violence and a recent government inquiry into stalking legislation posed the question of whether treatment programmes should be available for perpetrators and if so what should be their content according to nicole westmarland one of the report authors we have hardly any knowledge about how things like probation fines or even prison affect mens attitudes and behaviours towards women this is true but mainly because so few perpetrators are held to account by the courts we appear to have given up the battle to have domestic violence treated as a crime like any other which used to be the feminist mantra and have now declared the criminal justice system unfit for purpose in dealing with violence in the home we should not be giving up on the justice system before its potential effectiveness has been truly tested there are many ways its approach to domestic violence could be improved pilot programmes should be rolled out nationwide directing police to mandatorily arrest those who have committed acts of violence towards partners or expartners this way perpetrators will realise that it is not the decision of their victims to send them to court so victims will be in no further danger of revenge for doing so the crown prosecution service needs to take a more robust approach in getting perpetrators to court and speed up the process so the victim does not have to wait months for an outcome during this process the victims involved should be protected and supported by statefunded initiatives public education campaigns that aim to tug on the heartstrings of abusers such as posters depicting women crying and sporting injuries should be swapped for images of men in handcuffs or in a prison cell young women and men need to be educated about what is at the root of domestic and sexual violence that it is a cause and consequence of inequality and sexism people who beat their partners are making a choice we need to make sure the message that this is a serious crime not an illness is disseminated in schools let us return to the notion once at the heart of the feminist challenge to domestic violence that beating up your partner should carry as serious a consequence as assaulting a member of the public in the street,2015-01,stop man beating raping female partner according research published today sanction imposed criminal justice system prison probation attending course abuser domestic violence perpetrator

the high price of childcare is a large yet underrecognised factor in londons high cost of living new research for the charity children bears out the dilemma it can place families in it finds that nearly a quarter of parents in the capital believe theyll either give up work this year or think about doing so because the expense of employing a childminder or paying for a nursery to enable them to do their jobs outweighs the benefits financial and familial of working a similar number of parents anticipated cutting back on their working hours these figures are extracted from a national survey by opinium of parents with children aged living at home so the london sample will be have been pretty small even so the results are right in line with what we already know a london assembly report on the issue emphasised the problem caused by the affordability gap along with the complexities and inflexibilities of the various schemes designed to help parents secure the care they need using facts from the daycare trust it showed that the problem is bigger in london than elsewhere in britain with average nursery and childminder costs of a week upwards of higher and over higher respectively than elsewhere in the country the research for children seems to reflect this as its national figures for those considering reducing their hours or stopping work completely are at lower than those for the capital solutions although this cost of living story gets less publicity than housing or travel costs it isnt being ignored by londons politicians the assembly report was from a conservativechaired and dominated committee its six recommendations included urging boris johnson to encourage london employers to offer childcare voucher schemes responding to a question from lib dem am stephen knight johnson said in november that the london enterprise panel the partnership body he chairs is addressing childcare using european social fund money labours fiona twycross has also been pressing the mayor on the issue her party says its pledge of hours of free childcare for three and four yearolds would benefit london children mayoral hopeful tessa jowell gave a high profile to the issue in a recent speech childcare costs are part of the wider london problem of low incomes and poor pay bluntly affluent households can afford them while others struggle to do so in expensive areas a fulltime

the former national party senator bill ochee says women are being given a free pass by police on domestic violence and are just as capable as men of killing especially when children are involved ochee a columnist for fairfax medias brisbane times wrote that equal opportunity for women meant equal responsibility for their actions especially criminal ones but police were failing to prosecute them for acts of domestic violence citing the stabbing murder of eight children in cairns by the mother of seven of them the woman who allegedly dumped her baby in a drain and a woman who was charged with attempted murder of two children after allegedly setting a house on fire ochee said it proved domestic violence is an equal opportunity killer women are just as capable of killing in domestic circumstances as men especially when children are involved he said ochee said he had a solicitor friend who ruefully did not charge one woman with domestic violence when he was a police prosecutor upon reflection he agreed there was an inherent bias in the way police treated female perpetrators of domestic violence they usually get a free pass he wrote the problem with this is that we know people who commit acts of domestic violence are likely to escalate their crimes over time unless they are brought in check it follows that every time queensland police give a woman a free pass on domestic violence because she is a woman they may be creating a future domestic killer ochee cited statistics from the australian institute of criminology that show more than of familyrelated murders of children between and were committed by the mother data from various sources shows that on average one woman is killed every week in a domestic violence situation four out of five intimatepartner homicides involve a man killing his female partner data from white ribbon australia shows data from the department of families housing and community affairs show of women who experienced physical assault and of women who experienced sexual assault did not report it to police the chairwoman of the womens electoral lobby melanie fernandez called ochees comments irresponsible statistics clearly show the victims are mainly woman she said one woman a week is killed by a partner or ex partner its not the same for male victims fernandez singled out ochees comment that women were just as capable as killing in a domestic situation as just not accurate its pretty disappointing to see something like this published without a balanced or accurate view its quite problematic weve got such a big problem of violence against women to put something forward like this decreases the serious nature of that she said ochee a queensland senator between and was especially critical of police who he claimed repeatedly were failing to prosecute women over domestic violence they have no right to effectively condone domestic violence against men and children by refusing to charge offenders if they are women he wrote if the police are happy to charge women with armed robbery drug trafficking or extortion why are they not equally willing to charge them with domestic and interpersonal violence a bill was introduced into queensland parliament last year to strengthen domestic violence laws the parliamentary committee heard evidence of police telling victims to leave the house until the perpetrator had calmed down,2015-01,former national party senator bill ochee say woman given free pas police domestic violence capable men killing especially child involved ochee columnist fairfax

no matter how much women lean in to their careers women everywhere continue to be placed on the mommy track after peggy young took her former employer to court for placing her on unpaid leave for getting pregnant we asked our readers for their employers reactions to news of their pregnancies here are their stories stand up to maledominated boards and fight four days after telling my line manager an equity partner of my pregnancy i was placed in a redundancy consultation i fought them appealed against my redundancy and managed to keep my job if you find yourself in a similar situation i would advice you to stand up to maledominated boards and fight i owed it to my daughter to do that claire england it has been assumed that my priorities lie elsewhere since being pregnant and returning to work it has been assumed that my priorities lie elsewhere i am not ever asked to attend any functions that require travel or evenings even though i work in public affairs and this is part of the job once i returned to work after maternity leave my responsibilities have consistently been eroded despite consistently positive feedback about the quality of my work i dont have enough to do to fill my day now my worklife balance as a mother is already difficult and it seems easier to allow myself to be sidelined than to come to the office and have to lobby my boss about my abilities everyday the sensible advice is to just get another job but its never that simple i do want to have another child and if i moved job now that would mean being there long enough to qualify for another maternity leave im and time isnt on my side so i choose sit here and allow the professional rot to set in bb london he stopped speaking to me for five months when my employer found out i was pregnant he stopped speaking to me for five months basically until just before i went on maternity leave this was awkward and unpleasant as there were only three of us in the group he communicated with me through the other person even when i was in the room and invited them for lunch as if i was invisible it was hurtful and i could never understand why he treated me like this i returned to work five months after my son was born and stayed there for another six unhappy years until i finally had the opportunity to switch jobs in a what was an increasingly competitive and jobscarce environment i was unable to complain because i was fearful of his response and i had been taught to be compliant i was in an unhappy marriage and my confidence level wasnt particularly high at the best of times so i just kept my nose to the grindstone and tried to pretend that it wasnt happening to me he eventually sort of came to accept my pregnancy just before my child was born and even visited us at the hospital when my child was in intensive care at the age of two weeks i felt that my only option was to be thankful that he sort of came around i would advise other women to take maximum advantage of whatever support is available take as many days off as you can if that is possible during the pregnancy so you can conserve your strength and sanity and give yourself the occasional break continue to do your best at your job to give yourself a sense of accomplishment even if others dont see it v canada i came back from my maternity leave to a promotion my manager was incredibly supportive when i announced my pregnancy he has not had huge experience of pregnant employees in the past but has been flexible with my requirement for time off for appointments he has encouraged me to work from home one to two days a week when i need to and within three weeks i told him at weeks he had identified a maternity cover for me who will begin the handover after christmas when i will be weeks he has to keep my exact role open for my return but has also offered me a new role which is a huge promotion managing a larger team and with more development opportunity my husband had encouraged me not to tell work until after christmas so that my bonus wouldnt be affected but i feel confident that this wont make a difference at all as such i feel even more motivated to work hard during my pregnancy and am excited about returning sarah london the high costs of putting up a fight i worked for the new york office of a chinese corporation when they found out i was pregnant with twins they sacked me the same week saying my project was over i knew id never be able to afford to bring a case against a large international company for others in my situation it would be great if there was some kind of fund to help women with legal costs l new york before i had a baby i would really have questioned whether such sexism even existed there was a large reorganization whilst i was on maternity leave which no one informed me about and many of my colleagues were given promotions when i returned to work it was to a different team and the role was a demotion i asked hr and managers i had worked with for a more challenging role and was told that i would need to return to a role three levels below the one that i had held prebaby to prove myself again i had worked in my field for years been on the fasttrack highachievers programme been recognised an extremely effective manager and only taken six months maternity leave and yet found myself at a huge disadvantage before i had a baby i would really have questioned whether such sexism even existed especially as i work in an industry with very few women now i have no doubt that it does after a while i became so frustrated that i left the industry to start up my own business work is more interesting now compared to the roles i was offered but there is less job security i guess the only way to avoid being sidelined is to network as much as possible in the months leading up to having the baby then keep in touch during maternity but when youve worked hard for years to get to a certain level it is devastating to lose that progress because youre off for six months the company lost all the investment that they put into my career as well romy bristol my previous responsibilities were removed i was scrutinised by management all through my pregnancy and my performance reviews through the eighth month of pregnancy it caused lots of additional stress that was unnecessary as i was an established member of staff with proven track record when i returned after having a baby my previous responsibilities were removed two additional posts i had held were given to others and not returned when i went back j england,2015-01,matter

you know as a younger feminist i would never have imagined it would be the joint efforts of north korea and russell crowe whod be advancing the gender conversation about popular culture in the west yet its and here we are the infamous sony hack of late last year revealed from the emails of hollywood executives that a woman can be an oscar winner by her s and still get paid less in a film than some guy from the hangover now comes russell crowes contribution to feminist discourse which is to shame any woman from hollywood who notices aloud that good roles dry up as women age if you are willing to live in your own skin you can work as an actor rusty told the australian womens weekly virginia woolf pointed out in that fictitious women are now and then mothers and daughters but almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men whether rusty is up on his woolf or not he apparently lacks the basic skills of observation to notice that cinema theatre and broadcast and written literature is a system whose historical and present function is to overwhelmingly depict women as mothers wives daughters girlfriends or handilyavailable spermreceptacles to crowe the gendered disquiet from the likes of rosanna arquette who told the guardian in that hollywood wants to put me out to pasture is not because of centuries of cultural marginalisation of women really its because the greedy vain shecreatures of hollywood still want to play the ingenue the temptation to ask why society relentlessly requests the opinions of actors whose job is to speak words prewritten by others should be resisted in rustys case if theres one thing an actor rich enough to own a football team knows its the blissfully unconscious privilege of having a male body to cavort about in rather than humiliate themselves pursuing the ingenue roles that hollywood keeps you know writing for women maybe older female actors compete for the gentlespeaking thumping beefcake roles that have earned rusty his millions how marvellous to consider a role for a female actor of the weight rusty was allowed in master and commander the far side of the world a warriorprotagonist valorised for strength as well as acumen defined not by the feelings they possess but the job that they do across the world there are actual living women who wear the heavy crown of leadership across vocations and industries but fictionalised portrayals of women defined by their work are as yet incredibly rare they certainly are in master and commander a film almost entirely without women that its a historical movie isnt the point that theres yet a rich market for films completely void of women says everything consider the hollywood movies you recently watched and make a list of those that feature an older woman at work her story uncomplicated by a narrative decision to place a dick in her examples do not spring readily to mind its all right for crowe to decide if youre trying to pretend that youre still the young buck when youre my age it just doesnt work as an older male actor hes in the realm of playing the highstatus roles of kings and their contemporary equivalents he inherits a cinematic tradition that rewards the achievements of older men humphrey bogart cary grant and ahem harrison ford michael douglas and george clooney with the bodies of younger women james bond is decades into its franchise and is only now finding an ageappropriate partner for its hero and its apparently controversial yes theres been progress particularly in the era of longformnarrative television where someone somewhere finally realised that the complex agency of individuated female characters certainly gave the drama some interesting places to go but the horror of crowes comments is that he works alongside women of equal achievement to himself who are not afforded the same privileges that he is if women are campaigning for roles as ingenues its because roles that celebrate achievement leadership or character do not yet exist it doubles our unearned punishment to have the profiteers of that very iniquity come to slap us down feminists didnt invent concepts such as the male gaze or terms like love interest in

working mothers face almost constant disruption to their careers which can continue up to retirement with many women still choosing to go parttime or stop work altogether to accommodate the needs of their children a survey by the guardian and netmums has found the survey of women found that mothers who returned from work after maternity leave often chose to leave again when their children began school with more than half saying they decided to give up work go parttime or start working from home when their children reached primary school age nearly two thirds of respondents said they had put their careers on hold because they wanted to be at home to help their children with homework and support them over issues arising from their school day more than one in four added that schools made so many demands from classes that teach parents how to help with homework to requests for support on school trips that it became impossible to work fulltime charlotte munday gave up her fulltime job as the business manager for international sales at bmw in london for a parttime job near her home in surrey when her eldest daughter jessica began school in september i was surprised by how much more jessica needed me when she got to school said harris she needed me far more than when she was at nursery when she just needed a cuddle from someone she loved now she runs to me at the school gate to tell me about her day minor things to anyone else but to her the centre of her universe is collapsing if i didnt come home until hours later she would have to deal with all that intense emotion on her own another reason i went parttime is because the world is so much more competitive now she added i want to make sure jessica is doing her homework learning to enjoy learning and reading and getting every opportunity to do afterschool classes respondents said they spend considerable time during the day planning how to give their children creative help with homework closely supervising afterschool activities joining the pta and helping out in the classroom the survey also found that mothers in particular are likely to find their careers repeatedly coming into conflict with the needs of their children and that this disruption can continue when children reach secondary school with teenagers needing as much support outside of school hours as younger children siobhan freegard cofounder of netmums said the needs of young teenagers often takes parents by surprise the truth is that the older your children get the more they need you emotionally once they get to secondary school they also need a great deal of help to organise all the homework and other academic demands theyre suddenly faced with those surveyed admitted feeling uncomfortable with their choice to give up work with saying they feel embarrassed by the expectation that parents will work more not less when their child reaches schoolage almost said they are made to feel they are setting a poor example to their child by not working just said they felt their choice meant they were seen as a better parent freegard said mothers and it usually is mothers have been trying and failing to talk about this issue for ages its a hidden topic but it is not just parents who are taken by surprise by the intensity of the needs of their growing children according to scarlet harris womens equality officer at the tuc employers often have preconceptions that women in their s have finished their childrearing and as a result can be unsympathetic to requests for flexible working or other accommodations relating to childcare needs theres a lot of focus on childcare in the very early years but the assumption is that this goes away when the children get to school said harris author of the recent women over in the workplace report but given that ons figures show that nearly half of all births in were to mothers aged and above and one in babies is born to a mother over the age of it is perhaps less surprising that women in their early s are still caring for their children she said,2015-01,working mother face almost constant disruption career continue retirement many woman still choosing go parttime stop work altogether

childcare costs have reached almost half of the average salary in some areas of the country an analysis by the labour party has found data collected from local councils found steep increases in the average costs of a hour per week nursery place with particularly high charges in london and the southeast the highest figures quoted were in bexley south london at a week and the highly marginal seat of thurrock essex at a week childminder costs have also soared with rates increasing particularly steeply in london by more than a week since in croydon and harrow the highest weekly costs for childminders outside the city of london were said to be a week in barnet and in bexley overall the cost of parttime childcare is now at least a week in more than threequarters of local authorities labour found through freedom of information requests the party said this meant that in the vast majority of local areas families were spending a quarter or more of their average weekly earnings on childcare alison mcgovern shadow minister for childcare said the higher costs came at a time of fewer places and reduced government support labour gets that increased help with childcare is good for families and good for the economy she said we would extend free childcare for three and fouryearolds with parents in work from to hours worth per child per year we would also introduce a legal

domestic violence experts have warned that the use of specialist technology that enables abusers to stalk victims online and via mobile phones is growing at an alarming rate a series of parliamentary answers has revealed that in the months up to april police received reports of computers being compromised by spyware and malware malicious software both can be used by abusers to gather information from someones computer or phone they can allow abusers to view documents photographs or passwords and even turn on a devices camera or microphone mobile spyware can also reveal a persons location the real number of victims is likely to be considerably higher as most victims are unaware that they are being watched or are too scared to come forward the real number of incidents could be up to times that said harry fletcher criminal justice director of the digitaltrust a new charity set up to help victims of cyber abuse the trust says it sees new technology being used frequently in cases of domestic violence divorce custody battles and stalking and warns that the practice is becoming commonplace other experts agree my research shows that over of the time digital abuse is used within domestic violence said dr emma short of the cyberstalking research centre there are concerns that the huge rise in the use of covert surveillance software has left police forces struggling to keep up with demand for forensic examination of devices the trust claimed that in one force it knew of electronic devices that had been received for examination between january and august a increase on the previous year victims claim it takes up to months for devices to be examined this the trust says can cause timecritical intelligence and evidence to be lost or put cases at risk of collapse the time lag can also delay trials creating further stress for the victims the falling cost of spyware is helping to fuel the increase in surveillance a listening device that looks like an extension cord can be bought from amazon for a magnetic gps tracking device that is attached to a car and gives its location to a mobile phone can be bought online for as little as spyware that can control a computer can cost as little as sent in an email to a victim the software is activated when an attachment such as a photo is opened once installed the abuser has access to the victims emails and instantmessage conversations specialist mobile spyware allows abusers to turn on the microphone and listen to conversations the trust said it was aware of estranged husbands buying mobile phones for their children and adding spyware so that they could spy on their exwives it also warned that social media could act as a trigger and cause abusers to become physically violent in camille mathurasingh was murdered by her exboyfriend after she had posted a picture of herself with a new partner fletcher said that there was now an urgent need for police to log each occasion when a criminal act involved the use of new technology the college of policing believes that half of all offences reported to frontline police now have online or digital elements fletcher said it is extraordinary that the government collect

silicon valley elites like to think theyre miles ahead of the rest of the world but when it comes to openness toward women they are as behind as everyone else we are going backwards in a field that is meant to be all about moving forward hillary clinton told silicon valley in a speech this week i almost jumped out my chair with joy they needed to be given that message loud and clear success cannot shield you from sexism i managed to raise over for my startup in silicon valley and yet ive found myself in many sexist situations ive been repeatedly told that my idea was nice but too small my attitude too weak or too assertive and that two girls alone meaning my cofounder and i could never raise money from silicon valleys investors i proved them all wrong but that required sitting through presentations full of sexist jokes ive been welcomed on stage as the girl and have had to grin and bear it when i received compliments about my looks during business meetings its always a pleasure to be in such beautiful company one investor told me with a wink its hard not to feel the glass ceiling above me in those moments especially when delivering presentations to male dominated panels or pitching to male dominated venture capital firms if its a challenge to be a woman in the tech industry its an even bigger challenge to be a woman who speaks up sexism every time i do i find mobs of colleagues ready to tell me that raising money has nothing to do with gender it is equally hard for women and men when i point out the staggering numbers that speak of inequality im often accused of playing the blame game and hating men the truth is that silicon valley is permeated by a thick bro culture that pushes even the most intelligent women to think and act like frat boys in order to be accepted by the herd its not just the endless friday night beer pong parties its being forced to ignore whats happening in front of your eyes when newsweek published their recent cover story what silicon valley thinks of women investigating gender discrimination in the american tech industry one of my female colleagues at startups ceo of a successful company wrote on facebook i honestly hate menbashing articles like this one yes theres a gender issue but articles like this makes women sound so petty amp helpless only makes the situation worse newsweek might as well change the title to cant succeed lets blame it on men shes not the only one to think this way a good female friend and tech entrepreneur told me recently if you succumb to the blame game while you are in the game you lose this attitude just makes it easier for sexists to say see theres nothing to worry about but there is the dominant culture in tech constantly presents us with a false choice women must choose between speaking up about sexism and being valued for their talent and work it has become such a pervasive thought that ive repeatedly found myself thinking that i shouldnt complain too much will i lose if i do i wonder not if i want equality the best way to achieve a level playing field is to stop pretending everything is fine im glad that hillary clinton could speak up about sexism i just wish it were easier for women inside silicon valley to do the same,2015-02,silicon valley elite like think theyre mile ahead rest world come openness toward woman behind everyone else going backwards field

victims of domestic violence are abused for almost three years before they get the help they need and some are subjected to more than incidents during that time according to a study of the largest database of domestic violence victims in the uk the figures from the domestic abuse charity safelives reveal that almost a quarter of highrisk victims have been to an aampe with injuries sustained during violent abuse and some went as many as times before the problem was addressed analysis of the safelives database which has records of more than cases of adults experiencing domestic abuse since found that of victims had been in contact with an average of five professionals in the year before they got effective help from an independent domestic violence adviser idva or another specialist practitioner time and time again no one spots domestic abuse even when victims and their children come into contact with many different public agencies its not acceptable that victims should have to try to get help repeatedly this leaves victims living in fear and danger and risks lifelong harm to their children said diana barran the chief executive of safelives which was previously called coordinated action against domestic abuse caada barran said the study was more shocking evidence that domestic violence could often be stopped earlier every conversation with a professional represents a missed opportunity to get victims and their children the help they need she said safelives estimates that there are at least victims at high risk of murder or serious injury in england and wales of them women the study found that victims and often their children lived with abuse for an average of years threequarters reported abuse to the police and went to aampe because of violence sustained in abusive relationships frances wedgwood a gp in lambeth who provides training on domestic violence to health workers through the national iris project said a challenge for doctors was that many women did not come to them to disclose domestic violence domestic violence is still a very hidden problem and in my experience women do not disclose if they are not asked she said we need to get better at asking people directly if they need help the study sheds light on the longlasting impact of living in a family coping with domestic violence according to the survey in about a quarter of cases on the domestic violence database the victim has a child under the age of three the study estimates that children in the uk are living with domestic abuse and that children are directly harmed in of cases among teenagers who suffered domestic abuse in their own relationships almost half had grown up in households where violence was commonplace the study found vera baird former solicitor general and the current police and crime commissioner for northumberland said professionals needed help and training to have the confidence to deal with domestic violence domestic abuse is not a oneoff violent attack it is deliberate longterm use of coercion to control every part of the partners life violence sexual abuse financial control constant criticism isolating from family and friends are all familiar tools she said people in that situation do not find it easy to speak and need those who could help to be alert the alternative is what these figures suggest victims and their families locked unnecessarily into cruelty and illtreatment for years case study rebecca lived with domestic abuse for eight years before she sought help one time i was having a nap in the afternoon the baby had been teething so id been awake all night and i woke up he was standing over me with a mop handle carved into a point like a spear he was pushing it into my throat accusing me of cheating then he picked me up and threw me against the wall i ran downstairs but he followed me kicking and punching me and split my lip i locked myself in the bathroom and called when the doorbell rang i heard chatting calm talking there was one young male officer and my expartner was telling him that i was postnatal that id gone mental and he was just defending himself i started shouting at the officer why arent you helping me i swore and the officer said people could hear me and it was a public disturbance so i swore again he put handcuffs on me he wouldnt let me put my shoes on so i wouldnt move and he lifted me up by the handcuffs and put me in the back of the car i was in a cell for hours asking for a solicitor the duty sergeant finally came and when he opened the hatch he could see id been attacked he got the officer to come and apologise to me and asked me if i wanted to file a complaint or if i wanted to press charges against my partner but i said no i was exhausted and my baby was at home with my partner whod been drinking since the morning it got worse after that he was sort of smug saying he could do what he wanted i know theres more training for police now but that put me off calling the police for years by the abuse was worse we had two girls by that time i was hospitalised with concussion after hed kicked me in the head wearing steeltoecapped boots the police and the paramedics came and i was patched up and sent home they asked me if i wanted to press charges but i didnt want to go through all that i thought it would make it worse i didnt know where the support would come from where i could get help another time i went to the hospital walkin i had a black eye and it wasnt getting better a doctor asked me what had happened and i said id been punched in the face he repeated what i said you were punched in the face i didnt know what he wanted me to say i was ashamed i didnt want to say my husband did this to me if he had asked id have told him but he didnt social services got in touch because of the paramedics reports he got put on an anger management course but christmas day night hed been drinking he grabbed me by the throat and i stumbled and fell he kept kicking me over and over again my teeth went through my lip my nose was bleeding i couldnt see he picked me up and carried me to the bathroom saying look what you made me do why did you do that i crawled to the living room and phoned the police before he ripped it out of the wall i did press charges that time he was sentenced to four months for abh he served two we were separated but we got back together why i had such low selfesteem and he was always there always pestering me grinding me down hed be so nice helping with the children and i was exhausted i needed the help i thought it might be ok it was ok for a while the kids had been on the atrisk register because a couple of incidents had been reported but they came off that and social services were visiting less his behaviour just went back to the way it had been before and thats when i decided to leave i remember the exact moment when i saw the sticker for the womens aid helpline it was on the back of the toilet door in asda it took me a couple of months to call but when i did they offered me refuge i didnt even know that existed they organised transport when he was out it was quite surreal but it was such a relief womens aid were so helpful they gave us so much support including counselling my eldest daughter was seven when we left her sister was three and their brother was nine months that was the main reason i left i was terrified for my kids i do think professionals should offer support if they cant support victims themselves they just need to know who can i think if id had that information i would have left earlier i was when we got together he was by the time i was we had a daughter i thought it was a good relationship he helped with the parenting and around the house but about a year later in slowly controlling behaviour crept in he wouldnt like certain friends or me going out without him wearing certain clothes or makeup it was quite subtle at first but then when we argued there was pushing then hairpulling each time it was a little worse than before soon it was normal to have slapping kicking punching throwing things at first i didnt tell anyone my selfesteem was very low i just tried to pretend it wasnt happening i didnt know anything about domestic abuse,2015-02,victim domestic violence abused almost three year get help need subjected incident time according study largest database

its not a great time to be a working mother in the uk or so you could conclude from the news that one in five parents are considering reducing the amount they work or giving up altogether in because childcare is so costly oh and just of councils in england are fulfilling their legal obligation to provide childcare for working parents compared with last year central government grants to fund services like childcare are being cut year on year up to in some cases according to one council source which means that local authorities will struggle to pay for even these meagre provisions over the next decade and amid the din of election promises no party has come up with a compelling and convincing plan for making childcare affordable mostly because no party has made it a serious priority its as though theres an assumption that really women should just stay home and get on with the sticky business of childrearing and then check in again in a few years time when the next generation has safely started school these attitudes give politicians the excuse to turn a blind eye to whats swiftly becoming the biggest obstacle to equality in the workplace women being forced to stop working when they dont want to it doesnt have to be this way the ippr thinktank published a report suggesting that an increase by five percentage points in maternal employment in the uk could be worth m annually in increased tax revenue and reduced benefit spending in scandinavia the high proportion of working mothers means more tax revenue to fund the welfare state including taxsubsidised childcare its not a coincidence that the nordic countries where gender equality is highest and there are strong women in leadership positions are also the countries where quality daycare is most affordable so why are many in the uk still so squeamish when it comes to mothers going back to work having lived in denmark for two years now i was surprised by the judgmental reactions from folk back home when i enrolled my sixmonthold son in the taxsubsidised danish daycare system i was pretty much accused of child neglect by a couple you want a career and a baby who do you think you are greedy fyi no one has ever said this to my sons father but as a freelance journalist with a book deadline looming i didnt have much choice and i was in good company since of mothers go back to work in denmark and every child is guaranteed a place in statesubsidised daycare from six months onwards so far theres zero evidence that the children growing up in the lands of nord where both parents work and childcare is affordable have been emotionally or psychologically scarred by starting daycare under the age of one norway and finland both invest heavily in highquality childcare partially funded by taxes and in sweden theres a cap so you never have to pay more than swedish kronor around per month per child in iceland parents pay icelandic kronur per month approximately for hours a week from the time a child is seven months old and its considered healthy for young children to socialise from a young age and for both parents to set examples by working one mother of two tells me icelandic women would be offended if someone suggested they should stay home instead of going back to work were very independent childcare provision varies around the rest of the world in the netherlands mothers are expected back at work when babies are around weeks old but only parttime thered be a stigma to working fulltime with a small baby a dutch mother of one tells me a childminder will set you back around or a day and dads grandparents and extended family often share out the week between them to keep costs down in germany theres an infrastructure of nurseries that dates back to the time of the gdr that accepts babies from around a year old now local authorities provide taxsubsidised nurseries costing around or a month for hours a week in hamburg but there arent always enough places many french women go back to work after just eight weeks thats just the way things go there we think it is normal one mother tells me but a french nursery can cost in the region of around a month for hours a week in the us childcare is costlier still with nurseries charging around a month in some areas theres no national childcare programme and maternity leave is at the employers discretion with many mothers getting just six weeks one new mother tells me my son is barely sleeping more than an hour at a time but we have to send him to daycare at six weeks as we need dual incomes to survive it all comes down to money and in the us as in the uk childcare isnt considered a good investment but this is a grave oversight the quality of childcare services has repercussions for society as a whole the oecd has noted that a better quality of childcare service can contribute to a better start in life for children as well as enabling more women to make use of their professional skills which may otherwise be lost to society the benefits of highquality childcare are similar to the social benefits of education in other words it matters to all of us even if you dont have children even if you have no interest in social welfare this matters because these kids will be your future employees neighbours colleagues even your boss and without it a whole generation of women with voices and skills and useful interesting important stuff to say will have fallen out of the working world and thats something to feel squeamish about,2015-02,great time working mother uk could conclude news one five parent

the productivity commissions report into childcare and early childcare learning reveals that the problem of increasing womens participation is not going to be solved by small measures the governments insistence that any recommendation remain within the current funding model ensured the only measures the commission could recommend would be restricted the commissions inquiry was an election commitment made by the liberal party while in opposition childcare was is and will remain even after this report a hot political issue but the proposal to get the productivity commission to investigate it was always hindered by the requirement that it only consider options within current funding parameters it meant all that could happen was the same bucket of money be moved around less given to one sector or household and more given to another when the productivity commission released its draft report in july last year it let the government know in the subtle way in which such organisations operate that maintaining the current funding parameters was not the best option it proposed four different funding models and its most preferred was one which provided a subsidy of of childcare costs for households earning up and then declining at a linear rate until hitting for households earning or more a year it estimated this model known as the linear model would boost workforce participation by and would increase the hours worked by the problem is that the model is expected to cost an extra b a year the commission looked at abbotts paid parental leave scheme and suggested that there may be a case for diverting some funding from the proposed new scheme to another area of government funding such as ecec early childhood education and care where more significant family benefits are likely the commission estimated cutting the ppl would raise bn per year at the time the ppl scheme remained abbotts signature policy and thus the governments response to the suggestion was not shall we say overwhelmingly positive and so the commission went back to the drawing board and came up with a proposal that would fit within the current funding parameters but which is clearly in the commissions view a second best option the final model remains similar to the one in the draft report it proposes combining the current three childcare subsidies into one means tested one but the final model proposes to start at an subsidy for households earning up to before declining in a linear rate to for households earning or more thus households earning under would for the most part be better off while those earning over that amount would be worse off the pc estimates that even this model will cost around m more than the current arrangement among the main differences from the current arrangement which is a subsidy of out of pocket childcare expenses up to a year is that this would be a per hour subsidy paid directly to the childcare provider for up to hours a fortnight while the subsidy sounds great it should be noted it is based on a deemed rate of per hour for a to monthold child for a child aged months or over per hour for all children in family day care this rate is also applied to approved nannies and per hour in outside school hours care so if your day care fees are higher than that then you make up the difference its why the average subsidy for families earning to is estimated to be and not and yes like the draft report the pc is again recommending nannies be included but they must satisfy appropriate national quality framework requirements with the minimum qualification being the requirement of a certificate iii in early childhood education and care the model sees more funding for those on the lowest income less for those on higher income but also with the ability to be subsidised for nannies so a winwin proposal for the government to sell well not really the sector has responded with minimal enthusiasm one issue is with the deemed rate which is based on the median rate of childcare fees which they suggest will mean many families will not be as well off as the commission suggests as the actual fees they pay are well above the deemed rate but the problem for the government is that the political picture has also changed since the final report was presented to the government at the end of october last year in the time since then the government has dumped abbotts signature ppl scheme its polling has plummeted and a new and more high profile minister scott morrison has been put in charge of childcare while the desire to keep spending under control remains with the axing of the ppl and the need for the government to find a political win there would appear to be more wriggle room now than in october on the current funding parameters especially when the commissions own estimation is that the model will increase womens participation by just less than half that of the linear model and increase hours by just hours a week which sounds huge but bear in mind in january australians worked a total of around million hours a week the commission estimated that starting the subsidy at instead of its proposed for low income families would cost an extra m a year but would increase labour supply by a further hours per week and if they increased the minimum rate from to it would cost an extra m a year and lead to an extra hour per week but while more funding would help increase womens participation in reality were never going to see the boosts that we did during the s and s increases in participation also need cultural changes such as occurred in the s and s back then the change was for married women to work the move to the two income family men are still more likely to work than women but the gap has narrowed over the past years although the pace of the narrowing appears to have slowed recently changes to the childcare funding are necessary to keep increasing the participation rate of women the commissions report however shows that to make significant improvements the government will need to spend extra money because tinkering with aspects such as nannies and shifting money around from one family to another does very little it will be interesting to see if the government comes up with a policy that keeps within the current funding parameters or decides that second best is not enough,2015-02,productivity commission report childcare early childcare learning reveals problem increasing womens participation going solved small measure government insistence recommendation remain

why is there a recurring problem with men and female personal space one would have thought that personal would say it all but its as if some men interpret this as cop a feel whenever you like as was evidenced by the behaviour of us vice president joe biden while ashton carter was being sworn in as defense secretary biden placed his hands on the shoulders of carters wife stephanie for around unspeakably tense seconds whispered into her ear and finally let her go while this was going on stephanie carter had the look that most women would recognise the look that said sweet jesus hes touching me stay calm she was visibly cringing but trapped by circumstances she could hardly yell dont touch me at the veep during a public ceremony then theres the hideous automatic alltoo female slide into coping mode the inbuilt conditioning to keep the peace ms carter should have been enjoying a special moment in her husbands career not enduring the clammy grip of a handsy political silverback whose position in life suggests that despite all the apologists for his generation hes intelligent enough to know exactly what hes doing biden has form for this kind of thing hugging colleagues daughters nuzzling female politicians and thats just what hes caught doing in public theres even a term for it being biden how about stop being biden no ones suggesting that the females biden paws are under sexual threat but its not always about sexual threat it can just be about dealing with someone elses dreary personal problem a kind of halitosis of the hands i dont care if hes a good ol boy who means no harm why do men like biden give themselves permission to touch random women at all once again we return to the sanctity of personal space and how everybody male and female deserves the right to operate their own border controls either on the street in an office or at the swearingin ceremony of a new defense secretary being arbitrarily touched by someone can be unpleasant jarring and intimidating nontouching men would be amazed by how much the average woman deals with it from bidenstyle gripping to lunging dips to hands on arms to bizarre hovering over smalls of backs to outright grabs and please could we refrain from the mendacious framing of it as an equal opportunities problem even though it happens to some males sometimes it happens to females all the time try to imagine the white house situation with the roles reversed stephanie carter gripping bidens shoulders or to even things up hillary clinton or angela merkel doing the grabbing and whispering its implausible to say the least is it all just unfortunate misunderstandings perhaps though more likely its power play the toucher showing the touchee that they dont need permission instances of politicians touching each other hands pressed down on shoulders the covering hand in a handshake are sometimes perceived as shows of dominance it seems no different between a man and a woman even misunderstandings could be avoided by men allowing women to operate an invitationonly policy if a woman wants a man to touch her even just casually as a friend shes capable of making it obvious maybe by lightly touching him first until this happens men shouldnt even think about touching random women it is that simple if a woman wants to let a man into her personal space to any degree she will let him know if she doesnt or its unclear then its probably best they keep their mitts to themselves its time that men such as biden got acquainted with this concept of invitationonly just as women have to unpick their own goodgirl conditioning about personal space and truly start to believe that theyre entitled to some pistorius has rights like all prisoners reeva steenkamps family members are angry that her killer oscar pistorius is receiving privileges in pretoria central prison in south africa pistorius who was convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years has been recategorised he is now not a category b prisoner but category a meaning that among other things he receives longer better quality visits and more pocket money and phone calls as pistorius who is appealing is no longer considered a flight risk he could be released as early as this year spending the remainder of his sentence under house arrest the steenkamps lost a cherished family member in grotesque circumstances they would have to be superhuman not to be permanently angry about everything to do with pistorius not least the possibility of his early release from prison however with due respect it cant be any of their business how pistorius is treated within the prison walls pistorius won his new privileges with good behaviour some might think so what after what he did he shouldnt have the opportunity to win privileges he should be hanging by manacles from a wall its not as if reeva steenkamp is around to win privileges cases such as these inspire high emotion which is exactly why its so important to keep everything calm formal and not allow feelings to get in the way pretoria central prison sounds far from being a holiday camp moreover how fairly and humanely prisoners however notorious are treated within their penal system is an important indicator of the general good health of any society however much the instinct is for someone such as pistorius to suffer and rot the fact that he and his case are being handled this way is a good sign not a bad one been invited to chequers eat before you set off the prime ministers bill for hospitality at chequers for three

my late mother had five of us and not a penny off the state in those days antheas tweet sent to me last thursday when i was reporting on sky news about a liberal democrat pledge to increase state subsidies for childcare was not the first earlier a parenting campaigner named margaret expressed a similar opinion if you cant provide for your child yourself then wait til you can to have it why should the country pay no one paid me and linda agreed writing when my two were little it was normal to think about how many children we could afford it wasnt just twitter watching television and listening to the radio i soon realised that here was a widely held sentiment a visceral opposition to what one critic suggested we should literally call the nanny state on the london newsradio station lbc nick ferrari joined the debate while he was hosting nick clegg on the party leaders weekly callin show the presenter asked why childless couples should be asked to fund other peoples offspring it seems that many people cannot contend with the notion of public money being spent on very young children yet i suspect that most of the same people are much more comfortable with the idea of that taxpayer money kicking in and in droves at the age of four i certainly havent heard a similar dismissal of the principle of state schooling yet this dramatic shift in attitude is driven by a distinction between childcare and education which i believe is a false one it is true that childcare policies are in part about looking after children to enable parents who want to work to do so but when i talk to ministers and policymakers i do not believe that this is the only or even primary goal of this policy the real driver behind a move started by labour and extended by the coalition government to provide free nursery hours to four three and now twoyearolds is early years education and that is because they have all been convinced by the growing wealth of evidence about the impact access to nursery care can have on a childs life chances take the national childrens bureau finding that the gap in potential between children from middle and lowincome families is already evident among babies of months by three it is slipping away further with middleclass children having been exposed to four times as many words as their poorer counterparts but it is not all about poverty research by birkbeck and oxford universitys professor edward melhuish finds that the home learning environment is the most significant factor there are parents of all social classes who read talk and sing to their children and there are those who dont one primary school teacher put it bluntly to me some of her children arrive at school at four having spent far too much time confined to home glued to the television she felt that nursery care could help to prepare children and melhuishs research backs her up showing that access to quality preschooling from the age of two can be the critical factor on outcomes not just in the teenage years but on into adulthood he told me that the boost it provides is greatest for those who are most disadvantaged but significant for middleclass children as well the painful reality is that by four that magical threshold at which we all calm down about the states involvement in schooling it might already be too late this is a subject that has been gathering steam in parliament with powerful earlyyears proponents such as mps graham allen and frank field working on both sides of the house to get the message through the answer is not for formal education to begin earlier but the evidence in favour of state funding for playbased nursery settings from the age of two followed by a gentle transition into school life is clear that is why this is an issue on which many politicians of all stripes agree just watch as the party manifesto promises are unveiled the tories have supported these reforms in government and advisers tell me more is coming soon labour has already promised hours of free care each week for parents of three and fouryearolds up from the current hours and for the lib dems this is also a flagship last thursday the party promised hours of care a week but cleggs party put forward another idea to happen earlier than that to provide universal care for twoyearolds and for the first time to cover toddlers from nine months to two years if their parents are working the reason this final part is restricted to working parents much to the anger of those who are lobbying for stayathomemothers is that this policy has a different motivation it is not driven by early years education though it might obviously have some benefit instead it is about helping parents to work after all we heard last week of the spiralling costs of childcare particularly for young children a year up from these eyewatering sums make the decision to carry on working increasingly difficult to justify so on this side of things do the critics have a point writing personally we certainly thought about our financial circumstances before choosing to expand our family but even one child can be prohibitively expensive and there is good reason that many mums and dads go back to work when they have babies or toddlers even if it isnt economically sensible for them to do so at first some are thinking of the longerterm financial implications i certainly have friends who are actually losing money to work now so that their options do not shut down in the future others are thinking of their own work lives but with the hope that it will be a positive thing for them and their children of course none of that justifies state intervention by itself but a powerful economic argument can be made using taxpayer money to enable parents who want work to do so isnt just a drain on finances it can lead to more revenue in fact the ippr thinktank has published a report suggesting that a increase in maternal employment could be worth m annually in increased tax revenue and reduced benefit spending i discussed all this with anne longfield the outgoing chief executive of the charity children who will next week become britains childrens commissioner as a country we need a labour force that is available and skilled she told me to get that we need access to childcare as much as we need access to roads and rail her argument was to question why it is acceptable to discuss spending billions on hs to create links and work opportunities but not on childcare after all even these big political promises come with funding commitments that the early years sectors say will not cover the costs longfield says childcare should also be considered like a longterm infrastructure project i liked the way she put it not that it

becoming a feminist is a little like losing your virginity what at first manifests as a disappointing set of revelations about the world is often the beginning of meaningful new experiences and deep kinds of fulfilment in my experience feminist metamorphosis happens in a number of predictable stages which one might adumbrate as follows the scales patriarchy so painstakingly glued to your eyeballs fall away it burns it burns there follows a searingly painful period during which all you can see is gender inequality and sexism where once there was meritocracy and cheeky banter you feel powerless you cant shut up about it no one invites you to dinner parties you find people who do not want you to shut up about it they are called other feminists together you strategise organise and improve things you believe in the possibility of equality again youre part of a righteous movement thats changing the world the parties are awesome yeah but lets be honest with each other do you ever secretly long for the eyescales to be momentarily restored do you sometimes wish you could watch pretty woman without trying to ascertain its implied stance on sex workers rights are there things you used to like that feminism frankly has ruined for you of course there are today im going to take a moment to mourn of mine my cat frida katlo arrived in a duffel bag because her previous owner didnt have a cat carrier her head popped out and i thought uhoh thats unfortunate fridas markings make her look as though shes wearing a fake moustache that is slowly sliding off her face imagine if dal had painted an inebriated furry stalin thats my cat the rest of frida slithered like a gelatinous swamp thing from the depths of the bag two pendulous sacks of fat swung from her middle and brushed the floor as she explored her new surroundings if i had seen frida katlo before i agreed to adopt her i would not have agreed to adopt her frida is ugly frida is fat i have an ugly fat cat but would i even care about fridas wonky moustache if she were a boycat am i gendering frida who as a cat probably doesnt have a gender and imbuing her with all sorts of patriarchal assumptions about what girlcats should look like am i bodyshaming her is the ludicrously expensive diet cat food with which i have been lovingly starving her with little success for her at all or is it symptomatic of my own battles with mediagenerated beauty ideals i thought getting a pet was supposed to reduce stress not for feminists apparently catholicism there are all sorts of lovely things about growing up catholic so you did something bad little girl dont worry simply go into this darkened box with this creepy old man and tell him your secrets when you come out your soul will be sparkly clean for those of you who have never made a confession i can inform you the clean soul feeling is really nice ah a brand new leaf when youre seven you get dolled up in a mini wedding dress to eat jesuss body and everybody gives you money thats brilliant too i bought a holy bicycle or whenever youre feeling a bit confused and you know theres a heavenly father you can talk to in your head and lots of godly men around to tell you what to do oh wait its not only catholicism thats ridiculously sexist of course its most major monotheistic religions worshipping a male deity is not terribly compatible with the whole women and men are equal thing as a christian generally but especially when your church has an allmale clergy youre taught to conceptualise power and goodness as masculine this is an excellent way of making women accept patriarchy and keeping them in their celestially decreed place this said i think it must be easier to stop being a protestant than to stop being a catholic catholic churches and cathedrals are so darn arty seven sacraments mean that someones constantly having some kind of sacramentbased boozefest and there are certainly times when i wish that instead of the messy business of apologising and making amends i could just go into a darkened box with a creepy old man and get him to wash my soul anna karenina oh anna how sexy i found your story when first i read it as a horny west of ireland teenager with no access to erotic material how desperately romantic was your burning love for vronsky consummated breathily in a vestibule you spurned the dull affections of your ugly eared husband you listened to your heart but anna your society was not ready for your passionate soul years later i returned to your story as a feminist big mistake first the hot sex scenes i remembered didnt exist my teenage imagination had simply invented them out of desperation seriously all that buildup then its over in two minutes and you cry afterwards anna girl youve got to find your clitoris and second your problem with your husband is his ears not the fact that he married you when you were little more than a child and seems to think of you as an attractive pleasant sonbearing thing and finally when big ears finally offers you a divorce why dont you just take it because youve gone loolah from the sex it doesnt make sense stupid feminism i loved that book now all i can see is a grimly gendered morality tale ladies keep it in your pants or youll get squished by a train bras bras pretty patterned lacy things making your boobs look inhumanly spherical and providing entertainment when lovers try to remove them but one morning as i was getting dressed i thought why have i been strapping this contraption of cloth and wire to my upper torso for over a decade the shoulder straps would indicate that its a loadbearing device designed to aid with the transport of heavy objects i am modestly titty there is no load to bear i realised that i wore a bra only to hide my nipples and whats wrong with my nipples why should i apologise for my female physicality by wearing a surgical support every day of my adult life so i stopped attaching the elaborate nippledisguiser to my chest im really a lot more comfortable now however despite a clear lack of milkshake my nipples continuously bring all the boys to the yard and unlike kelis i do not regard a yard full of pervy boys as a cause for celebration dancing on bars or tables or poles while free shots materialise from the ether as a feminist i think its dismaying that young women are sucked into raunch culture and learn to equate their social value with porny writhing for the sexual pleasure of men on the other hand dancing on bars is fun im glad that i got plenty of it in before i became politicised and while my liver could handle all the free tequila television all of it i cant watch television not since feminism happened no more flopping on the couch with my loved ones for mock the week i cant get past the fact that all seven comedians are male though admittedly the only thing worse is when they get a token girl on and dont let her speak its no good changing the channel every other station is pumping out programming based on maddening gender stereotypes putting it out into the collective mind of a populace that accepts the prejudice as if it is normal as if it is perhaps the offshoot of innate genetic differences between men and women breathe breathe remember to breathe i stopped watching television in when i realised that i had written five letters of complaint to television stations and advertisers in the space of a month my letters said things such as i do not need a flock of women in bikinis to sell me contact lenses i had reached peakfeminist i now live in a little bubble of carefully curated content in my bubble films directed by women are as common as films directed by men girls are funny rape isnt funny the bubble is amazing yes i realise that in this regard ive simply replaced the patriarchy scales with feminism blinkers but sometimes blinkers are the most humane option monogamy youre a feminist youre questioning the genderrelated norms in the world around you trying to figure out which ones are oppressive eg sexual objectification domestic violence workplace discrimination and which ones are ok lipstick and you begin to feel that a social system in which people claim rights of sexual ownership over each others bodies and get very angry when these exclusive rights are violated is a system so deeply imbued with patriarchal capitalist ideology as to make gender equality impossible you take your head out of the theoretical clouds and look at the grounded reality of monogamy you see lying cheating shame even violence and you think is this because of love or is it because of the idea that we own the sexual function of the people we love love should make us happy im looking at you anna karenina yet jealousy so often an excuse for abuse is romanticised by the logic of monogamy while love is vilified surely with compassion commitment and communication we can find the courage to love differently polyamory is the future compassion commitment and communication are a lot of bloody work though primary partners secondary partners all replete with complex emotions sometimes at am on friday night when you just want to be out dancing with your friends but are instead processing with a partner new to poly you wonder when did life become one long conversation about everyones feelings you remember being and trying to stop your boyfriend from punching a bloke who asked for your number while he was in the jacks brutal yes but alluringly simple thomas the tank engine when i was little i listened to ringo starr narrate so much thomas the tank engine on my fisherprice tape player that i began speaking with a distinctly liverpudlian accent percy was my favourite sensitive wee fellow i loved cranky gordon too especially when he called percy a nincompoop which was my best word until i wasnt allowed to use it any more but there werent any girl engines only annie and clarabelle thomass carriages who were naggy and annoying when i have kids im not going to read them thomas the tank engine story books even though i remain fond of those anthropomorphic locomotives i dont want my hypothetical but adorable offspring to learn that boys are the engines and girls are the carriages but they can call me a nincompoop all they like my bike outside my professional life i have a regrettably gendered skillset i can cook sew and apply eyeliner in a moving vehicle im good at hugging sad people playing sweet little songs on the guitar and knowing when to open a bottle of wine i like all of these stereotypically girlie aspects of myself what i dont like however is that im so bad at the stereotypical boy stuff mechanics diy you know the skills my brothers were busy learning from dad while mum and i experimented with roux in the kitchen so last year i decided that instead of taking my bike to the shop for its annual checkup i was going to join a collective and learn how to turn those nuts and bolts for myself the first time i went i was there for three hours ruined a good shirt fixed my brakes and afterwards felt an inordinate amount of pride to be riding around on a vehicle that i made with my own bare hands kind of the second time i went i was there for three hours didnt manage to fix the problem with my front wheel couldnt ride my bike home and was late for dinner as well as a deadline the third time i i didnt go a third time my bike has been sitting sadly in the hall for months because i havent been back to the collective but im too stubborn to take it to the shop its feminisms fault my bike is broken picasso i studied picasso in school and once spent a whole day at the picasso museum in barcelona i was a fan but that was before i became a feminist when i went to see a picasso exhibition at tate modern with my mum a few years ago my internal monologue went a bit like this object object object boobs object object womanobject boobs object object object boobs afterwards i needed to feminist so bad its not a good idea to feminist at my mum because she doesnt think sexism is a thing but i was going to burst if i didnt mum i ventured did you notice that the subject matter was basically objects and women painted as though they were objects what said mum an eyebrow raised suspiciously against the threat of more feminist malarkey i tried a different tack did you notice that there were a lot of boobs she nodded there were a lot of boobs yes it wasnt much but it was enough to tide me over until i got back to the other feminists emer otooles girls will be girls dressing up playing

parttime has risen by around a third over the past five years with parents now forced to pay an average of a year more than in despite heavy government spending on childcare gaps in provision are also increasing the survey found in addition for the first time britains poorest families are having to find substantial sums to make up the shortfall between parttime childcare costs and the maximum amount of help they can claim under working tax credits the reality is that for too many families it simply does not pay to work concluded the family and childcare trust in their annual childcare costs survey it now costs around on average to send a child aged under two to nursery for hours a week in britain a total of per year this is a increase on last year when population distribution is taken into account the price of a parttime nursery place for the undertwos has risen by over the term of the last parliament the cost of parttime care by a childminder for a toddler is up by on last year an average of per week or a year the survey also found parttime nursery prices for children aged two and over have risen by to per week on average while a childminder for this age group is up to for the first time outside of london some parents on the lowest incomes are finding that the maximum amount of help they can claim for childcare is leaving them out of pocket by at least a week the report suggests that there are two reasons for the increases in prices for undertwos in england nurseries and childminders are putting up their prices after keeping them down during the recession and parents are subsidising the governments free places for disadvantaged twoyearolds the survey also found that the problem of insufficient childcare provision is getting worse not better with just of councils in england fulfilling their legal obligation to provide childcare for working parents compared with last year the report suggests three reasons for the fall in supply over the past year women returned to work between september to november last year while places for older children may have been eroded at the expense of the increased number of places for twoyearolds in general and those twoyearold children who qualify for free early education in particular a department for education spokesman said the report neglects the record amount of fully funded childcare we are giving based on the fcts own figures our free entitlement will save the average eligible family per year for each child nick clegg the deputy prime minister acknowledged the cost of childcare was rising he pledged

the kinks immortalised it in waterloo sunset it has formed the backdrop to films such as alfie and wendy cope used it as a setting for a poem for the millions of londoners and tourists who use it each year to cross the river and gaze at the famous views along the thames it is waterloo bridge but for the boat men who ferry tourists up and down the thames it is known as the ladies bridge because of the key role women played in its construction now a campaign is to be launched to celebrate the efforts of dozens of women who worked in stone steel timber and concrete on construction of the bridge after replacing irish labourers who went home at the outbreak of war in women were working in construction the campaign backed by the womens engineering society aims to have a blue plaque placed on the bridge in memory of the womens contribution and to trigger a hunt for other civic examples to which women have contributed without acknowledgement each generation of women believe they are groundbreaking because the history of whats already been achieved isnt there says filmmaker karen livesey in while making a short documentary about the bridge she made an an unsuccessful attempt to track down female construction workers who worked alongside men on the bridge and would be able to give their accounts when asked what theyve done women have a tendency to say its nothing no photographs exist of the women at work on the ladies bridge and all records were lost when peter lind the construction firm that hired the female workforce went into temporary receivership in dr christine wall a construction historian who has researched the bridge says that betty lind jaeger the daughter of peter lind now in her s said that as a child she was brought to the site by her father s and she recalled seeing women at work the contribution of men in construction is often invisible says wall women doubly so the campaign for the blue plaque has been launched by feminists jen lexmond and cassie robinson at the beginning of the year in the new wing of somerset house at the foot of waterloo bridge they opened the civic shop encouraging people to participate in a variety of projects as active citizens in their research in the archives of womens engineering society wes they found teatowels from the electrical association for women imprinted with designs that encouraged women to use electricity domestically to make time to pursue work outside the home it was through contact with wes that the two learned about the ladies bridge so many contributions by women have gone unsung says cassie robinson the campaign is a way to unearth more and have them properly acknowledged on march liveseys film will be shown at somerset house followed by a discussion on how to encourage more women and girls into the science technology and engineering stem industries in spite of a number of campaigns the proportion of women in stem remain stubbornly at around says engineer dawn bonfield president of the society we need more of the stories retold to make womens contribution come alive the women working on the bridge says wall would have earned around one shilling and sixpence an hour far less than the male rate when the men returned from war the women were ousted during the war women made up of construction job workerss across the country in it was wall says she welcomes the idea of a blue plaque she adds that sir giles gilbert scott the bridge designer included four plinths to hold sculptures of the four winds but nothing came of the idea it would be wonderful to have four

benjamin schmidt an assistant professor at northeastern university has created an online tool that allows users to compare the frequency of particular words in evaluations of male and female professors schmidt created the interactive chart using data from million student reviews on the website ratemyprofessorscom the results are striking we already know that performance evaluations can reveal serious gender bias whether deliberate or unconscious and that women and men can be judged very differently for exhibiting similar behaviour where a man is seen as assertive decisive or passionate a woman risks accusations of being shrill overbearing or hysterical a phenomenon that can have a particularly negative impact for women in the workplace but this new data seems to suggest that the problem starts earlier and is already in full effect during higher education there is something almost hypnotic about typing search terms into schmidts tool and watching the coloured dots swim from one side of the chart to the other splitting themselves repeatedly along gender lines the more terms you can think of the more the tool reiterates most societal stereotypes try switching from funny to annoying for example and watch the dots zoom towards opposite sides of the screen reviews of male professors are more likely to include the words brilliant intelligent or smart and far more likely to contain the word genius meanwhile women are more likely to be described as mean harsh unfair or strict and a lot more likely to be called annoying immediately recognisable societal stereotypes emerge the words disorganized or unorganized sic come up much more frequently in womens evaluations while men are far more likely to be described as cool or funny with one of the widest gender splits of all on the word hilarious women are more commonly called nice or helpful but men are more often described as good there is a silver lining here while the results certainly reinforce gender stereotypes about intelligence and personality there is less focus on female professors looks than one might anticipate the search term hot reveals completely mixed results and though it is used rarely the word sexy is more likely to appear in evaluations of male rather than female teachers the battle isnt entirely won however as beautiful does crop up for female teachers albeit far more rarely than other descriptors such as good or funny as schmidt himself points out the reliability of the data is limited these are online reviews rather than official student feedback its not possible to break down the results by the sex of the reviewer and of course there is room for error in making assumptions about the sentiment of a sentence containing any given word but this can be mitigated in part by schmidts tool which allows users to see the frequency of each word with higher frequency results likely to be more reliable and to filter for results from only positive or negative evaluations the findings are also backed up by other studies one of which surveyed college students feedback about online course professors and found that the ratings were higher in every category when students were told the professor was male the strength of this unconscious bias is quite astonishing even for a relatively objective measure such as promptness students rated a female professor out of and a male professor despite the fact that they handed work back at the same time the implications are serious in the competitive world of academia student evaluations are often used as a tool in the process of hiring and promotion that the evaluations may be biased against female professors is particularly problematic in light of existing gender imbalance particularly at the highest echelons of academia according to the american association of university professors in of men in academia in the us were tenured compared to only of women while women were far more likely to be in nontenure track positions than men of women in academia compared to just of men meanwhile statistics obtained in by times higher education revealed that only about one in five uk professors are female with the percentage of female professors at some universities as low as or data from the nonprofit organisation catalyst suggests that the imbalance persists internationally too set alongside the unconscious bias of academic recruiters themselves as well as the difficulty of juggling parenthood with the demands of research the apparent sexism in student evaluations provides yet another hurdle for women in academia it is interesting to consider these results in the context of a wave of troubling recent reports about sexism and misogyny on campus perhaps it will be difficult to tackle biased

at first glance eve enslers campaign one billion rising can appear slightly woolly the idea that women gathering en masse to dance in public could help end violence against women and girls is to me fairly sketchy but with countries taking part and grassroots organisations and activists coming together worldwide this saturday is it time to drop the cynicism and join in when i ask ensler the author of the vagina monologues what success for one billion rising would look like she does not equivocate it is no less than ending violence against women and girls everywhere and forever the campaign was launched to invite one billion women the figure represents the one in three women who the un says will be raped and beaten in their lifetime to take part in mass actions or risings which can encompass anything from demonstrations to poetry readings although yes dancing and drumming are encouraged in a spirit of solidarity and resistance this year the number of events is growing although with anyone free to create their own risings it is impossible to keep track including says ensler in provinces of afghanistan states in mexico and hundreds of places in the philippines the attraction she says is the energy of being part of a global movement last year for instance there were risings in bangladesh focused on labour rights in the wake of the rana plaza factory collapse where more than garment workers died in hong kong thousands joined an event focusing on the plight of domestic workers after a young indonesian maid erwiana sulistyaningsih was allegedly abused by her employer on saturday london activists are hosting what theyre calling a love revolution carnival with drummers artists and musicians to focus attention on sexual abuse and grooming in the uk sometimes in the feminism movement we separate into silos says ensler and this is a way of supporting each others issues and weaving a tapestry which eventually will lead to system change at a time when it can feel as if grassroots activism is often overshadowed by online infighting the emphasis on action solidarity and communityled events feels refreshing although inevitably the celebrityheavy events in cities such as london or new york gain the most attention each year the campaign focuses on a different theme last year it was justice with events taking place outside court rooms and detention centres as well as town halls and corporations this year it is revolution because says ensler if you want to end attacks against women it is the system that has to change from neoliberal capitalism to patriarchy people are interpreting revolution in different ways from calls to oust their countrys president to fighting against abuse in the family in the us restaurant workers are rising for a raise this is work they are doing on their own but with obr we show solidarity lots of groups have adopted rise for the raise so that becomes a solidarity movement her work in raising awareness of violence against women wont stop says ensler because the violence has not ended this is also the year we have seen mass kidnappings of girls by boko haram she points out and the hideous rapes of yazidi women in iraq women raped in the military and on campuses in america there are also endless horrors raising awareness is a concrete change in itself she adds if i had danced at years old in a mass protest to end violence against women i would have grown up knowing that no one had a right to violate me i would have gone to the authorities because i would have had a community around me who encouraged me to tell the truth and i would have known i had support thats not to say ensler hasnt faced criticism some activists have suggested it is insulting for a white feminist to instruct women in the developed world on rising above their pain through dancing it is a criticism she finds particularly hurtful and she insists is unfounded the director of the campaign she points out is monique wilson who is from the philippines and along with global coordinators is responsible for making sure each region sets its own agenda to say women in the global south dont have agency over their decisionmaking is at best patronising or at worst terribly insulting so what tangible results has obr achieved ensler has an impressive list in india rickshaw drivers were given gender sensitivity training in peru construction workers designated their sites as sexual harassmentfree zones in the philippines activists forced the authorities to take action when young girls working as scavengers on rubbish dumps were being coerced into sex work in zimbabwe a projustice movement for young women emerged from the campaign but the dancing and drumming is not something i can shake ensler says it is a way of reclaiming public spaces for women and for survivors of sexual violence resisting the idea that their bodies are something to be ashamed of when you are raped you are forced to leave your body because it is a landscape of terror and pain it feels contaminated and polluted just the act of releasing your trauma when you dance can make you feel part of a community yet she says it is also a powerful way to resist the way the patriarchy is so ingrained in us creative resistance to violence is as crucial as any legislation she says before laughing at my silence but i know in britain you

its time for friday the th to stop being considered unlucky not because im a diehard rationalist my grandmothers cure for warts was to steal a bit of bacon and bury it in the garden ive spat at more magpies than youve had chicken dinners and i touch wood like apprentice candidates touch base no my problem with friday the th is that it feels like a huge waste of an opportunity friday is the only day in the british week named after a woman freyja the anglo saxon goddess of fecundity shares the rest of the working week with a veritable sausage fest of gods thor woden and tyr and while yes i know about those superstitions judas was the th guest at the last supper there were steps to the gallows its the crap roll in a bakers dozen but havent we moved on from fearing that a group of women is in fact a coven my father is spending this friday the th taking his two daughters to watch the england womens football team take on their american counterparts at stadium mk wouldnt it be nice if the date were met with a sense of occasion rather than suspicion if the four friday the ths taking place in were seen as womanly rather than woeful if we could wash off centuries of mysterious and unfounded fear in the name of our second x chromosome because if we can replace fear with feminine celebration we might just be able to break misogynistic unease that sees a group of women as a potential meeting of witches that is reluctant to allow women on board boats that bans women from the kitchen during their period that throws the word curse over its shoulder like salt in satans eye in her book the curse a cultural history of menstruation janice delaney wrote that a taboo is a supernaturally sanctioned law under which something is always seen as symbolically dangerous or otherwise defiling by marking friday the th as dangerous and defiling we have transformed it from a date into a taboo and sadly taboos can still be extremely dangerous look at tanzania where last year people in a single village were killed on suspicion of being witches look at india where menstruating women are often prohibited from visiting temples cooking and even collecting water look to saudi arabia where women like amina bint abdulhalim nassar can be beheaded on accusation of sorcery taboos and the havoc they wreak will exist for as long as we allow fear to slide into our lives of course it would be wonderful if we used friday the th to campaign for better abortion rights closing the pay gap increasing the average nurses salary to more than to demand better paternity leave to introduce selfdefence lessons in schools and to call for the cuts to womens refuges to be reversed but we could also just use it to phone our mums it could be a reminder to book that cervical smear we know is due to be honest id just be happy if friday the th became a day when four women organise to go out for dinner at a midrange chain restaurant and order their own pudding instead of sharing because hey its their day we cant wipe out inequality with tokenism of course hanging the reputation of a single day isnt going to bring patriarchy down like a game of kerplunk but we could quite easily and with no apparent harm to the economy stop treating friday the th as an ill omen to turn it from a day of fear into a moment of female festivity to claw it back from the jaws of superstition and deliver it from evil after all its february that prompts the martyrdom massacres and terrible movies,2015-02,time friday th stop considered unlucky im diehard rationalist grandmother cure wart wa

labour women have boarded their pink bus on the first day of a tour to woo female voters despite mockery from david cameron and nick clegg as well as reservations from some on their own side harriet harman the deputy labour leader said the activists did not care about critics who said it was patronising and pointed out that it did not have big eyelashes on the front its not about a colour its about something its about our democracy its a small bus but big issues she told sky news harman said it had already attracted the attention of women who wanted to talk about issues ranging from child care to domestic violence the bus is due to visit constituencies so that activists can talk to some of the nine million women who do not vote on a visit to an asda supermarket in stevenage hertfordshire harman and her team were heckled by a man who demanded to know why the party did not have a blue bus to talk to men he was wearing a tshirt that read this is what a victim of feminism looks like it emerged that there had been doctrinal discussions about whether a man would be allowed to drive the bus full of women one of the drivers hired to take the labour women round the country is a man supplied by the union unite although a woman was behind the wheel for the first day of the tour as the tour began the partys political rivals claimed the van was a condescending gimmick speaking at rime ministers questions cameron said it was evidence that the labour party cant talk to women because theyve got a pink bus touring the country clegg the deputy prime minister told the western morning news its just a tiny bit condescending because its bright and pink therefore women relate to it more its a bit like saying that political parties should drive around in macho red

how did that campaign strategy meeting go then was it the womans hour poll last week that showed that more than a third of women have yet to decide how to vote and that young women are serially uncertain or the mumsnet poll before christmas that suggested the labour lead among women was shrinking down from points to nine the lingering impression that david cameron has a women problem his flashman persona finally beginning to count against him or the research that shows women tend to be less engaged with the political process than men and whichever one it was in what way will bussing female labour mps around the country help still theres the minibus or perhaps its a van harriet harman who has fought so valiantly all her career for women says she signed it off for her woman to woman campaign and its not pink its magenta this is exactly what voters really dont like about politicians this habit of saying something is one thing when it obviously isnt politicians see themselves putting the record straight changing the emphasis or shaping public perception voters call it lying this bus is pink pink the are so many colours in the rainbow yet they chose pink are the barbie years so far behind them that they have forgotten the twin peaks of the anatomically preposterous doll and her passion for pink or worse maybe just maybe the voters are right politicians really dont live lives like other people so they do not know that pink is the colour of patronising or at risk of disappearing up my own vanity mirror maybe they think only people like them think pink is patronising harman is unabashed she says the target audience will not be discussing the colour of the bus i salute her optimism but sadly i cannot share it for what is already clear is that the van will always be the barbie van and the jokes about parking reversing and women drivers must all have been made even if not everyone has yet made them lets deconstruct this minibus idea reaching out to voters theres lots of evidence to show that personal contact matters high media impact its certainly getting lots of coverage but the adage that theres no such thing as bad news doesnt invariably hold in politics and public derision sticks worse than scrambled egg to a pan so then maybe it will draw attention to labours record on recruiting and promoting women and prowomen policies im happy to oblige but dont hold your breath for too many others harman insists that the value of her roadshow and its pinkmagenta bus is to show other women that politics is not just for men the reason why it has to be eyecatching is that there is a big hole in our democratic politics she says in million women didnt vote and thats because they just dont think that politicians have any interest in their lives but surely the problem politicians have to tackle is that far too many people men as well as women gay straight and trans all think politics is in fact only for politicians there is only a very slight difference in turnout at general elections between men and women what makes a difference is female candidates and although there is still a way to travel labour should be proud of its record recruiting women into the political process more than twothirds of candidates selected for the most winnable seats where an mp is retiring are women thanks to the use of allwomen shortlists but if you do dig into the voluminous polling studies and disaggregate as the pollsters say the results by gender you find that what is troubling female voters is what is also troubling male voters the future of health and education this election is not about women or men its about every one of us set beside the existential question of the future for public services making a particular effort to engage female voters seems at best a diversionary tactic labour is right to try to engage with people who dont vote but it needs to start somewhere else altogether the gap in voting between haves and havenots is where the division becomes really stark more than threequarters of the social class ab vote but only of those at the other end of the pollsters social metric bother to turn out and if race is added to class the gap is starker still barely half the ethnic minority population votes against twothirds of white britons these are the people who really feel politics is not about their lives politicians

a bright pink minibus of female labour mps will tour constituencies to talk to female voters around the kitchen table in an effort to win their vote in marginal constituencies the party has revealed unveiling the campaign labours deputy leader harriet harman said the pink bus tour was not patronising as the party recognises that women have different patterns in their working lives which need to be addressed by public policy she also defended the choice of colour saying it was important to make sure the bus was conspicuous the tour of constituencies will focus on five areas that labour has determined are key to women childcare social care domestic violence equal pay and political representation labour said it would engage with women outside the school gates in shopping centres and in work places with a particular emphasis on the million who did not vote in the last election lucy powell one of the partys new general election coordinators said labour was taking its message female voters because they wanted to have a conversation about the kitchen table and around the kitchen table rather than having an economy that just reaches the boardroom table all parties will be battling hard for the female vote in mays election after a tns poll for bbc radio s womans hour that found a disproportionate number remained undecided compared with of men however they will have to make an extra effort to avoid seeming like they are patronising voters after the better together campaign advert featuring the woman who made her mind up which was heavily criticised for being condescending asked whether this charge could be levelled at the woman to woman pink bus tour harman said i dont think its at all patronising to recognise that women have got different patterns of their working lives theres different patterns in families between what women do and what men do that is to recognise the reality and to say public policy needs to address that one danger there isnt is that actually people wont want to talk to us or engage with us and will think were patronising im confident that people will think well theres somebody here interested in my life and listening to me about how ive got to work till im and look after a relative and look after a grandchild and im very good at my job but im underpaid the labour deputy leader also explained the choice of bright pink while acknowledging there had been some internal debate about the issue theres been a discussion about size and colour she said this is actually a one nation labour colour it will attract attention and will be different from the normal thing of people shouting down the megaphone is it not magenta we could have had red but that would look like all the other labour vehicles and we wanted to mark that this was something different then we looked at a darker red but it looked like a pret a manger van we wanted to it to look conspicuous and therefore a white van wasnt going to do the job we were not going to have it blue or any of the other party colours we wanted it to be visible and i think its a great colour the campaign was launched as seema malhotra shadow minister for preventing violence against women prepares to give a speech arguing greater gender equality in politics is necessary because research shows that in general male lawmakers are less likely to initiate and pass laws that serve women and childrens interests the use of the pink bus was immediately mocked by labours political rivals tory mp caroline dinenage said the wheels have come off the labour bus getting harriet harman to drive around the country in a pink van to try and attract the female vote is as patronising as it gets this is clearly just another divisive gimmick that the electorate will see through a lib dem

a labour government would double the length of paternity leave and vastly increase levels of paternity pay under plans to be revealed by ed miliband on monday new fathers would be offered four weeks away from work and be paid per week more than at present the labour leader will say the plans would be funded from savings from tax credits miliband will announce the plan as part of a set of familyfriendly proposals to be outlined this week insiders say he hopes to highlight the difference between labour and the tories outdated plans to help married couples with tax breaks the labour plans were first discussed by the institute for public policy research ippr last year and attracted criticism from business leaders who said they could add to the financial burden on small firms but miliband will say the plans are fully costed and necessary for families the tories want to spend m on what they call a married couples allowance but which in fact will go to just one in five families with children he will say thanks to the last labour government fathers have two weeks paid paternity leave millions of families have benefited with parents saying this has helped them support each other share caring responsibilities and bond with their children but the money isnt great and too many dads dont take up their rights because they feel they have to go back to work so they can provide for their family so today we are announcing plans to double paid paternity leave and ensure the money available is as good as the national minimum wage he will say fathers are currently eligible for two weeks paternity leave paid at the statutory rate of a week an entitlement that of fathers take up beyond these two weeks fathers have no independent right to parental leave labour will say family life has changed dramatically with more women in work and fathers more involved in parenting the plans would be paid for using savings from tax credits the party said the plan to extend free childcare to parents of three and fouryearolds will mean they no longer have to rely on benefits to pay for their children to be looked after the ippr a leftleaning thinktank estimates that extending paternity leave to four weeks paid at the level of hours at the national minimum wage would cost m in on top of existing spending on statutory paternity pay this is based on the assumption that takeup will increase from to the house of commons library estimates that extending free childcare for three and fouryearolds to hours a week will reduce government spending on childcare through tax credits or universal credit by significantly more than m the latest measures follow a labour announcement on saturday that in government it would tackle a shortage of childcare places by doubling the number

a future labour government will aim to double the number of childcare places provided at sure start centres to more than tristram hunt has said the shadow education secretary said on sunday that labour would save sure start centres by introducing a statutory obligation on them to provide access to childcare as well as giving them fresh powers to open their doors to charities and local providers for use by the whole community the move would reverse a decision in by the coalition government when sure start centres were freed from a previous requirement to provide childcare labour claims that hundreds of centres have since closed as local authorities faced funding cuts and many more have reduced services the party hopes to push the issue of sure start centres to the centre of the general election campaign appearing on bbcs the andrew marr show hunt said the scheme would make the best use of these public buildings reestablishing them as family hubs in the community and reaching more people than before what we have got is these public sector facilities which are sitting here not being used so we are saying that childcare centres will have a statutory duty to go out to barnardos to go out to children to go out to childcare providers and say we have these facilities we know you have rising demand come and use them he said labour claims that there are fewer sure start centres than in and that many more are running reduced services it says that if the number of childcare places continues to fall at the current rate there would be fewer places by the end of the next parliament last year hunt suggested that labour would not reopen around sure start centres that had closed party sources told the observer prior to his andrew marr show appearance that that remained his position but the aim was to make use of existing facilities in the most efficient way possible at present many sure start centres that used to provide childcare still occupy the building where that care was provided with many providers lacking sufficient space of their own hunt believes the policy meets demand at zero cost but as labour insisted the move would not cost extra money because it would rely on charities and other providers using existing premises and employing their own staff the conservatives said the promise of so many more places amounted to an uncosted labour spending pledge amounting to bn hunt insisted the spending claim from the tories was untrue and that the plan would give providers including charities facilities they desperately needed benefiting local communities a conservative spokesman said that to meet its pledge labour would end up spending money hardworking people will pay the price for ed milibands chaotic illdiscipline through higher taxes more borrowing and more debt he said labours initiative was welcomed by the childrens charity children which said it would ensure that unused sure start premises could be occupied by providers wanting to meet rising demand anne longfield the charitys chief executive said childcare is one of the biggest financial and logistical challenges for many parents we know that one in five parents paying for childcare are considering giving up their job or reducing their hours as a result of the financial strain with over childrens centres across the country and a third telling us they have space to provide more childcare there is a huge untapped resource that has the potential to both support parents with the challenges of childcare and give children the best start in

a new election battleground has opened up as labour pledges to save popular sure start childrens centres from further closures and double the number of childcare places they provide to more than shadow education secretary tristram hunt who had previously questioned the wisdom of reopening centres will say on sunday that a labour government would restore a statutory obligation on those centres still running to provide access to childcare while also granting them powers to open their doors to charities and local providers to use their facilities the move would reverse a decision in by the coalition government when sure start centres were freed from a previous requirement to provide childcare labour claims that since then hundreds of centres have closed as local authorities faced funding cuts and many more have reduced services labours initiative was welcomed by the childrens charity children which said it would ensure that unused premises in many remaining sure start centres could be occupied by providers wanting to meet rising demand anne longfield the charitys chief executive said childcare is one of the biggest financial and logistical challenges for many parents we know that one in five parents paying for childcare are considering giving up their job or reducing their hours as a result of the financial strain with over childrens centres across the country and a third telling us they have space to provide more childcare there is a huge untapped resource that has the potential to both support parents with the challenges of childcare and give children the best start in life but as labour insisted the move would not cost extra money because it would rely on charities and other providers using existing premises and employing their own staff the tories said the promise of so many more places amounted to an uncosted labour spending pledge amounting to bn hunt insisted the spending claim from the tories was untrue and that the plan would give providers including charities facilities they desperately needed benefiting local communities it is a scandal that these brilliant community assets are being mothballed or even closed at a time when parents are crying out for decent childcare in their communities he said we will not succeed as a country unless we ensure every child has a decent start in life at present many sure start centres that used to provide childcare still occupy the building where that care was provided with many providers lacking sufficient space of their own hunt believes the policy meets demand at zero cost he said were going to put the lights back on get the kids back in and restore the founding purpose of sure start our plan will place local authorities under a legal obligation to provide access to childcare at these centres along with the power to do it by opening up the doors to local providers desperate for good premises like these a conservative spokesman said that to meet its pledge labour would end up spending money he said once again labour are shaking the magic money tree to pay for unfunded spending commitments thats exactly how labour got us into a mess in the first place hardworking people will pay the price for ed milibands chaotic illdiscipline through higher taxes more borrowing and more debt last year hunt suggested that labour would not reopen around sure start centres that had closed party sources said that remained his position but the aim was to make use of existing facilities in the most efficient way possible labour claims that there are fewer sure start centres than in and that many more are running reduced services it says that if the number of childcare places continues to fall at the current rate there would be fewer places by the end of the next parliament the tories insist that many have moved premises and merged with other organisations and there have only been outright closures since,2015-02,new election battleground ha opened labour pledge save popular

tweeting about sexism could improve womens wellbeing according to a new study published in the british journal of social psychology the study suggests that a sense of collective action may be at the root of the benefits participants were divided into groups some were asked to tweet publicly some privately and some not to tweet at all according to the abstract only public tweeters showed decreasing negative affect and increasing psychological wellbeing suggesting tweeting about sexism may serve as a collective action that can enhance womens wellbeing since launching the everyday sexism project in ive seen firsthand the positive impact that sharing stories via social media can have ive seen women tweet their experiences of street harassment and receive support understanding and solidarity from others all over the world ive seen a woman tweet a story of workplace discrimination and receive a reply from an hr manager in a different city offering to lend their expertise to help ive received messages from men explaining that theyve come across these tweets unexpectedly and feel that their eyes have been opened to a problem they hadnt previously been aware of so the results of this study do not come as a surprise to me but they may come as a surprise to those who argue that using social media to try to advance social justice amounts to lazy clicktivism by futile keyboard warriors it is often argued that the recent wave of online feminism is somehow lessened by its medium or that sharing experiences online weakens victims giving them an easy way out instead of reporting incidents elsewhere this line of thought fundamentally fails to recognise the very nature of gender inequality which is often subtle cumulative and deeply ingrained not every instance of everyday sexism is something that could be reported elsewhere but having a forum to share these grievances can help victims to take back a sense of power and control a sense of protest over powerlessness dont underestimate the catharsis and empowerment that can come simply from telling your story and having it accepted and believed in a world where it is so often ignored or brushed off those who argue that sharing these stories online prevents justice being done couldnt be more wrong indeed the opposite is true we live in a world in which many victims of sexual violence or discrimination are made to feel guilty or blamed for their ordeals or simply do not believe they will be taken seriously it is this that holds them back from reporting not the fact that an online forum is available to share their experiences the women who share their stories online arent doing it instead of an official report they would otherwise have made they are doing it to break what would previously have been silence hundreds explicitly mention in their tweets or posts that they have never felt able to share their story with anyone before even partners or family let alone reporting it to the police whats more a great number of women have written in to everyday sexism to reveal that they have found the courage to report an assault to the police or workplace harassment to their employer precisely because the stories of other women online have given them the strength to realise they are not alone and that they have the right to stand up one student told me that it was only after seeing a feminist video shared on twitter that she realised what she had experienced could be classified as sexual assault a runner wrote that when a man assaulted her in the street it was the other womens stories she had read online that gave her the strength to stop take down his car number plate and report him to the police a teacher wrote that after she shared the stories with the girls in her class they started their own feminist society and began to stand up to sexism at school what happens online doesnt stay online its impact can be far wider of course social media isnt perfect perhaps no single form of activism is for a start it excludes those without access to the internet or electronic devices which is a major problem so it needs to be used in conjunction with other efforts in addition social media users posting on topics such as sexism may face vitriolic abuse from trolls but its capacity to spread an idea to millions of people around the world is undeniable and unique as hashtags such as yesallwomen youoksis and whyistayed have proved and while activism shouldnt start and end with the internet the point is that different methods can combine together to effect change social media can be one starting point from which wider efforts grow at everyday sexism for example we take many of the stories shared with us online and use them to create real change offline using them to start conversations around consent and healthy relationships in schools for example that way those who might not have accessed the project online are still included through outreach in the community we use the thousands of entries we receive from women in the workplace to provide politicians and businesses with an idea of the kind of abuses women are still facing in their careers from maternity discrimination to sexual assault we used the stories we had received from women on public transport to inform our work with the british transport police on project guardian which included the retraining of members of staff around victimcentred principles and has raised reporting of sexual offences on london transport by writing a tweet isnt the same as going on a march or writing to a member of parliament but it is valuable in its own right as we battle to shift deeply ingrained sexist norms it matters that millions of people are able to stumble across the feminist message and see those norms challenged on social media it is a new way to reach those who might not ever deliberately seek out the message elsewhere just as it is frustrating to see feminists constantly told that they are fighting the wrong battles it is equally reductive to suggest they shouldnt be using the wrong platforms why shouldnt stcentury feminism make use of every tool at its disposal,2015-02,tweeting sexism could improve womens wellbeing according new study published british journal social psychology study suggests sense collective action may root benefit participant

the conservatives are not succeeding in getting more women into parliament and new laws may be needed to improve the gender balance in the house of commons according to a senior tory mp who was in charge of candidates before the last election bernard jenkin a member of the conservative backbench committee and formerly vicechair of candidates made the comments to essex university students on wednesday night pointing out that no country in the world had managed to get an equal parliament without some form of positive discrimination towards women he said i was deputy chairman of the conservative party for candidates and we introduced something called the alist and we tried very hard to do it by persuasion we achieved a certain amount by persuasion but i think we are not succeeding and the labour party are succeeding with quotas the liberal party is miles behind the conservatives have made some progress but not enough so far a third of the tory candidates picked to defend the seats of retiring mps at the next election are women compared with half of the liberal democrat candidates and threequarters of the labour candidates in those seats where they have the best chance of winning jenkin told the guardian he had recently mentally crossed a rubicon when it came to backing positive discrimination in the conservative party whether that took the form of quotas or another system in relation to the candidates selected to run in jenkin said in terms of pure numbers we are not looking as good as we should he added weve made herculean efforts but the point i made was that nowhere in the world has achieved equality of representation for men and women without some form of positive action my preference would be to do this by legislation for all parties so they are all in the same boat i just think it is going to take too long the way we are doing it at the moment whether you simply put an obligation on parties to make sure there is equal representation something needs to be done it is no criticism of anyone in particular it is just an observation the points that people tend to make are that women dont want to go into politics and that then becomes selffulfilling why should we allow that its a combination of biology and culture that makes it more difficult for women thats what the alist was an attempt to do many within the grassroots of the conservative party are fiercely opposed to positive discrimination including allwomen shortlists or other forms of quotas having boosted their female representation from to after the last election david camerons alist of women candidates was scrapped however some top tories including nicky morgan the education secretary and womens minister have indicated they could be open to reviving the idea if the party fails to bring in more women at the next election jenkins wife anne runs the women win campaign to encourage female candidates he has previously spoken out about outdated attitudes towards women in his party telling the house magazine in that male conservative mps were guilty of unconscious slights towards their female colleagues he said the tory party tended to assume that women would deal with womens issues leaving the men to run the country,2015-02,conservative succeeding getting woman parliament new law may needed improve gender balance house common according senior

when its not busy collecting transitory super bowl sharks as memes the internet loves nothing more than finding and spreading new words like a virus like mansplaining macquarie dictionarys word of the year no shhhh let me explain it to you mansplaining is when a man explains something to a woman in a patronising way assuming that only he can educate a woman he presumes ignorant but who may actually have more knowledge than him that was the case with rebecca solnit who endured a man talking over her declaration shed written a book about eadweard muybridge because he was so busy talking about the very important muybridge book that came out this year he was actually referring to the book she had written but he was so busy demonstrating his lack of knowledge he ignored her voice and her authority and her knowledge thus mansplaining was born or at least baptised at the font of internet neologisms mansplaining is a silencing tactic designed to keep womens voices out of conversations even feminists who as we know never shut up or journalists recently rand paul literally put his fingers to his lips sssshed a cnbc journalist in a live interview and later advised her how to be a better interviewer leading her to apologise there was no apology from guardian journalist lenore taylor when clive palmer told her she was very naive when it comes to politics my girl before launching a mansplanation of political process its an accusation not often levelled at someone who has spent most of the past years reporting on politics taylor observed writer clementine ford created the rhetorical questionsformen to highlight the sexism women face every day only to find men answering the questions while other men mocked and crowded the hashtag with their own hot takes but of course men answered the questions the hashtag even has the word question in it gah why are feminists so difficult its like they dont realise feminism will fail unless they include men because we live in a world where a mans voice is respected no matter the conversation a world where he might never consider to listen instead of speak obviously everyones favourite portmanteau has been criticised its sexist as two men less knowledgeable about sexism than me explained to me at length once via twitter that two men spent an hour mansplaining why i was sexist to use the term mansplain is so achingly perfect it should be included in the macquarie dictionary as an example but those men were entitled to express their opinion because as we all know white men talking is not given enough attention in the public sphere where they have to make do with only presence throughout all australian media but lets assume mansplaining is a benign act one of patronising overexcitement and a trait all too easily shared by women the fact of the matter is that women are given so little leverage to be as boring and patronising as men in the office home or parliament we dont really have as much evidence of femsplaining as we do mansplaining thus femsplaining remains a myth much like the gender pay gap and female orgasm of course there are criticisms of using the term mansplaining to excess and theyre most likely valid but that isnt sexism thats people stupidly overusing words they dont understand like bae budget surplus and minister for women sexism is when a womans voice at work is continually ignored until a man says the same thing only to find acceptance or when a man is given more airtime on qampa to talk and any woman who tries to get a word in is accused of shouting him down despite evidence to the contrary of course people dont like the word mansplaining they dont want to accept womens voices are still not as accepted as mens perhaps someone in the comments can mansplain to me

for the past three years or so at least one stranger has sought me out pretty much every day to call me a fat bitch or some pithy variation thereof im a writer and a woman and a feminist and i write about big fat bitchy things that make people uncomfortable and because i choose to do that as a career im told a constant barrage of abuse is just part of my job shrug nothing we can do im asking for it apparently being harassed on the internet is such a normal common part of my life that im always surprised when other people find it surprising youre telling me you dont have hundreds of men popping into your cubicle in the accounting department of your midsized regional drygoods distributor to inform you that hmm youre too fat to rape but perhaps theyll saw you up with an electric knife no just me people who dont spend much time on the internet are invariably shocked to discover the barbarism the eager abandonment of the social contract that so many of us face simply for doing our jobs sometimes the hate trickles in slowly just one or two messages a day but other times when ive written something particularly controversial ie feminist like say my critique of men feeling entitled to womens time and attention or literally anything about rape the harassment comes in a deluge it floods my twitter feed my facebook page my email so fast that i cant even keep up not that i want to it was in the middle of one of these deluges two summers ago when my dead father contacted me on twitter at the time id been writing a lot about the problem of misogyny specifically jokes about rape in the comedy world my central point which has been gleefully misconstrued as procensorship ever since was that what we say affects the world we live in that words are both a reflection of and a catalyst for the way our society operates when you talk about rape i said you get to decide where you aim are you making fun of rapists or their victims are you making the world better or worse its not about censorship its not about obligation its not about forcibly limiting anyones speech its about choice who are you choose the backlash from comedy fans was immediate and intense that broad doesnt have to worry about rape she wont ever have to worry about rape no one would want to rape that fat disgusting mess holes like this make me want to commit rape out of anger it went on and on to the point that it was almost white noise after a week or so i was feeling weatherbeaten but fortified nothing could touch me anymore but then there was my dads dear face twinkling out at me from my twitter feed someone bored apparently with the usual angles of harassment had made a fake twitter account purporting to be my dead dad featuring a stolen beloved photo of him for no reason other than to hurt me the name on the account was pawwestdonezo because my fathers name was paul west and a difficult battle with prostate cancer had rendered him donezo goofy slang for done just months earlier embarrassed father of an idiot the bio read other two kids are fine though his location was dirt hole in seattle my dad was special the only thing he valued more than wit was kindness he was a writer and an ad man and a magnificent baritone he could write you a jingle and record it on the same day a lost breed of lounge pianist who skipped dizzyingly from jazz standards to flanders and swann to lord buckley and back again and i can genuinely say that ive never met anyone else so universally beloved nor do i expect to again i loved him so so much theres a term for this brand of gratuitous online cruelty we call it internet trolling trolling is recreational abuse usually anonymous intended to waste the subjects time or get a rise out of them or frustrate or frighten them into silence sometimes its relatively innocuous like asking contrarian questions just to start an argument or juvenile like making fun of my weight or my intelligence but particularly when the subject is a young woman it frequently crosses the line into bona fide dangerous stalking and harassment and even innocuous harassment when its coming at you en masse from hundreds or even thousands of users a day stops feeling innocuous very quickly its a silencing tactic the message is you are outnumbered the message is well stop when youre gone the volume and intensity of harassment is vastly magnified for women of colour and trans women and disabled women and fat women and sex workers and other intersecting identities who gets trolled has a direct impact on who gets to talk in my personal experience the fiercest trolling has come from traditionally white maledominated communities comedy video games atheism whose members would like to keep it that way i feel the pull all the time i should change careers i should shut down my social media maybe i can get a job in print somewhere its just too exhausting i hear the same refrains from my colleagues sure weve all built up significant armour at this point but you know armour is heavy internet trolling might seem like an issue that only affects a certain subset of people but thats only true if you believe that living in a world devoid of diverse voices public discourse shaped primarily by white heterosexual ablebodied men wouldnt profoundly affect your life sitting at my computer staring at pawwestdonezo i had precious few options all i could do really was ignore it hit block and move on knowing that that account was still out there hidden behind a few gossamer lines of code still putting words in my dads mouth still using his image to mock abuse and silence people after all its not illegal to reach elbowdeep into someones memories and touch them and twist them and weaponise them to impress the ghost of lenny bruce or whatever nor should it be of course but that doesnt mean we have to tolerate it without dissent over and over those of us who work on the internet are told dont feed the trolls dont talk back its what they want but is that true does ignoring trolls actually stop trolling can somebody show me concrete numbers on that anecdotally ive ignored far more trolls than ive fed and my inbox hasnt become any quieter when i speak my mind and receive a howling hurricane of abuse in return it doesnt feel like a plea for my attention it feels like a demand for my silence and some trolls are explicit about it if you cant handle it get off the internet thats a persistent refrain my colleagues and i hear when we confront our harassers but why why dont you get off the internet why should i have to rearrange my life and change careers essentially because you wet your pants every time a woman talks my friends say just dont read the comments but just the other day for instance i got a tweet that said may your bloodied head rest on the edge of an isis blade colleagues and friends of mine have had their phone numbers and addresses published online a harassment tactic known as doxing and had trolls show up at their public events or threaten mass shootings so if we dont keep an eye on what people are saying how do we know when a line has been crossed and law enforcement should be involved not that the police have any clue how to deal with online harassment anyway or much interest in trying social media companies say just report any abuse and move on were handling it so i do that but reporting abuse is a tedious labourintensive process that can eat up half my working day in any case most of my reports are rejected and once any troll is blocked or even if theyre suspended they can just make a new account and start all over again im aware that twitter is well within its rights to let its platform be used as a vehicle for sexist and racist harassment but as a private company just like a comedian mulling over a rape joke or a troll looking for a target for his anger it could choose not to as a collective of human beings it could choose to be better so when it came to the case of pawwestdonezo i went off script i stopped obsessing over what he wanted and just did what felt best to me that day i wrote about it publicly online i made myself vulnerable i didnt hide the fact it hurt the next morning i woke up to an email hey lindy i dont know why or even when i started trolling you it wasnt because of your stance on rape jokes i dont find them funny either i think my anger towards you stems from your happiness with your own being it offended me because it served to highlight my unhappiness with my own self i have emailed you through other gmail accounts just to send you idiotic insults i apologize for that i created the paulwestdunzogmailcom account amp twitter account i have deleted both i cant say sorry enough it was the lowest thing i had ever done when you included it in your latest jezebel article it finally hit me there is a living breathing human being who is reading this shit i am attacking someone who never harmed me in any way and for no reason whatsoever im done being a troll again i apologize i made donation in memory to your dad i wish you the best he had donated to seattle cancer care alliance where my dad was treated that email still unhinges my jaw every time i read it a reformed troll an admission of weakness and selfloathing an apology i wrote back once expressed my disbelief and said thank you and that was that i returned to my regular routine of daily hate mail scrolling through the same options over and over ignore block report engage but every time i faced that choice i thought briefly of my remorseful troll last summer when a segment of video game fans began a massive harassment campaign against female critics and developers if you want to know more google gamergate then shut your laptop and throw it into the sea my thoughts wandered back to him more and more i wondered if i could learn anything from him and then it struck me why not find out we only had made that one brief exchange in the summer of but i still had his email address i asked the popular us radio programme this american life to help me reach out to him they said yes they emailed him after a few months of gruelling silence he finally wrote back id be happy to help you out in any way possible he said and then there i was in a studio with a phone and the troll on the other end we talked for twoandahalf hours he was shockingly selfaware he told me that he didnt hate me because of rape jokes the timing was just a coincidence he hated me because to put it simply i dont hate myself hearing him explain his choices in his own words in his own voice was heartbreaking and fascinating he said that at the time he felt fat unloved passionless and purposeless for some reason he found it easy to take that out on women online i asked why what made women easy targets why was it so satisfying to hurt us why didnt he automatically see us as human beings for all his selfreflection thats the one thing he never managed to articulate how anger at one woman translated into hatred of women in general why when men hate themselves its women who take the beatings but he did explain how he changed he started taking care of his health he found a new girlfriend and most importantly he went back to school to become a teacher he told me in all seriousness that as a volunteer at a school he just gets so many hugs now seeing how their feelings get hurt by their peers he said on purpose or not it derails them for the rest of the day theyll have their head on their desk and refuse to talk as im watching this happen i cant help but think about the feelings that i hurt he was so sorry he said i didnt mean to forgive him but i did this story isnt prescriptive it doesnt mean that anyone is obliged to forgive people who abuse them or even that i plan on being cordial and compassionate to every teenage boy who tells me im too fat to get raped sorry in advance boys i still bite but for me its changed the timbre of my online interactions with for instance the guy who responded to my radio story by calling my dad a faggot its hard to feel hurt or frightened when youre flooded with pity and that in turn has made it easier for me to keep talking in the face of a mob roaring for my silence keep screaming trolls i see you hear lindy wests show at this american life,2015-02,past three year least one stranger ha sought pretty much every

when the parliament comes to an end on march of the labour partys most highachieving female mps and former ministers will be standing down some of them began their parliamentary careers in and together they have clocked up years in parliament the list includes two former secretaries of state tessa jowell and hazel blears and five former ministers or junior ministers anne mcguire meg munn dawn primarolo glenda jackson and joan ruddock as well as former parliamentary private secretary sin james and committee chair joan walley their colleague linda riordan another committee stalwart is also now standing down together they have put major new government laws on the statute book on everything from equality to education the environment and civil partnerships without these women there would have been no sure start centres and early education for the underfives no reduction of vat on sanitary protection and contraception there would have been no genderneutral drafting of legislation and no equality act which drew together legislation on equal pay sex discrimination race disability and religion even the olympics might not have come to london had jowell not spent more than years pushing for it they have ensured that positive measures were introduced to allow more female mps to join them with the controversial adoption of allwomen shortlists they also helped to reform the malecentric culture of westminster ruddock led the campaign to end latenight sittings and walley campaigned for a family room that famously once resembled a gentlemans club and some feel now does again blears says the labour women have made progress but that things are once again moving backwards i think women individually have made a difference people like tessa but it is individuals i dont think we have systematically changed the way it is politics at the top is very male dominated the characteristics that seem to allow people to rise are still male she says some of what they fought for in her first days in the commons has been lost the smoking room had a very male atmosphere full of chesterfield settees where nye bevan used to plot in the s when we came in the smoking room was dominated by male tory mps who drank a lot of brandy smoked cigars and would sit in there in the evening and talk affairs of state we determined as women that we would take the smoking room on tuesdays we would gather in force and drink pink fizzy wine and we would occasionally giggle and we would talk fashion or we would talk politics and affairs of state we would occupy literally the centre of the smoking room and gradually the men disappeared to the fringes and then disappeared when we came back this time in opposition in it was very interesting to see that that room is now colonised again by male tory mps mcguire too remembers finding westminster inhospitable in terms of the general environment the one thing that surprised me and this is really trivial is that all the furniture was built for men if you are my height you cant sit all the way back in a chair in the members room and we all used to laugh about it my feet dont touch the ground and it was an uncomfortable seat there was no ladies toilet in the lobby there were no machines for womens sanitary products she thinks labour women and younger male mps did help to change westminster after i do think the introduction of so many women at one time helped partly because they werent from the same kind of networks that the guys were part of there were a lot of younger men mps as well who had families still in their constituencies who didnt do what a lot of men did which was to move their families down to london walley remembers similar obstacles in her early days in westminster even the toilets they had on them members only but they were for men mps not women mps the chairs that you sat on had splinters on them and wrecked your tights our boys were down here too and there was nowhere for them to go and that was what led me to set up the campaign to get the family room like her colleagues she feels womens progress is in reverse gear again and social progress too i think it is the populism and a lack of understanding about politics which reduces it to the lowest possible denominator there is a sense of people not looking in depth at what the issues really are james a miners wife who handed out food parcels during the strike and whose life is portrayed in the film pride agrees i didnt think i would have come a degree circle where i would be handing out food parcels now to my constituents primarolo too regrets not achieving more my sadness is that i think my constituents are in a worse place now and it doesnt look good going forward we should have done more we look at what we didnt do but now i realise we did our best and the main thing is that i have learned that i have to encourage others to fight the same battles again that is what democracy is you never reach your destination you are always trying to reach it it is imperfect you make mistakes and that is all you can do their proudest achievements in their own words dawn primarolo mp for bristol south one thing that makes me smile and i know that because of the work i did there it may seem like a small thing but it was the reduction of vat on sanitary protection followed by contraception it was important to women and it was also symbolic joan ruddock mp for lewisham deptford i led both of the campaigns to change the hours first of all with ann coffey and then with a slightly wider group of women from all parties for the second time round we were utterly determined because it wasnt only that women were suffering the men were suffering as well their families were suffering terribly but of course they wouldnt talk about it joan walley mp for stokeontrent north i did a lot of work in the early s as a shadow transport and environment minister preparing policies for an incoming labour government this included setting up the environmental audit select committee which i now chair tessa jowell mp for dulwich and west norwood there are two things i am most proud of sure start which i designed and got the money for and set up as an early nurture programme that then became a child care programme across the country and the olympic games which i lived with for years hazel blears mp for salford and eccles i was promoted to public health minister and we did five a day so people who get fed up with eating five a day it is my fault and we banned tobacco advertising too anne mcguire mp for stirling i was one of the two ministers to take forward the civil partnership bill in and was in new york to sign the un convention protecting the rights of people with disabilities on behalf of the uk government megg munn mp for sheffield heeley one thing i did on my own was to persuade jack straw leader of the house that legislation should be genderneutral it actually took a couple of years to persuade people most people dont notice but now there but that is my mark on history sin james mp for swansea east my proudest achievements are the campaigns in the constituency when people have come in and told us about issues and we have changed things getting pension rights reinstated and fighting for better train services and electrification to swansea interviews by jackie ashley

childcare for my twoyearold son costs a year for a nursery in a somewhat ramshackle old building in the east midlands like many parents i wonder where on earth the money is going but in a remarkable act of transparency the nursery has thrown open its books warts and all and it is extraordinary to see where the cash really goes my son attends castle lane day nursery in market harborough leicestershire which is independently run by friends vikki underwood and harriet wakefield who took over the struggling business three years ago by borrowing each from the bank of mum and dad the nursery only has an ofsted rating of satisfactory which may put off some parents but i chose it because it was immediately obvious that staff morale is high and that they all care deeply for the children on their books wages unsurprisingly the biggest monthly outlay is on paying their staff just above minimum wage which accounts for almost of their expenditure wages totalled in the last tax year the family and childcare trust says that nationally wages for frontline staff account for more than of childcare costs due to government staff child ratios of for under twos for two to threes and for over threes if we have four children in the baby unit we need two members of staff which is not cost effective but this is sometimes what can happen wakefield says directors pay and profits the directors themselves work full time at the nursery and take home a month each in salary and dividends that is equivalent to a year in salary topped up to a year with dividends hardly a fortune the previous years accounts show a net profit of but after tax and the salary topups the few thousand pounds left are invested back into equipment such as a new deck for the toddlers play area rent it was a surprise to see how much goes to pay for the building rather than shelling out money to pay handsome rewards to the directors parents such as myself are actually spending of their fees on rent a annual spend for the business and on business rates utilities and building repairs administration costs the recent price rises i was told are largely due to increased administrative pressures from the push to meet the requirements of the early years foundation stage eyfs framework and statutory managerial responsibilities including training provision which is no longer provided by the local authority due to spending cuts the amount of paperwork staff have to get done means we are paying out a fulltime salary to cover this outside of the staffchild ratios wakefield says there is always someone in the unit every day who is a spare member of staff who has to do their learning journeys termly reports or displays it also appears that around of my monthly bill is subsidising government spending cuts as the county council no longer provides regular training in childrens safety or first aid meaning the cost is pushed on to the nursery and subsequently passed on to parents and the duplication of efforts has an impact on fees a childs twoyear checkup by a health visitor is now supposed to be supported by a report from the childs nursery or childminder if they have one as well as a lengthy questionnaire filled in by parents all of which provide much of the same information new regulations a constant barrage of new and updated statutory requirements and regulations around care health and staff provision also mean additional man hours to pay for and thus fee increases for example from december all childcare providers were required to comply with the food information regulation meaning every snack or dish from a rice cake to lasagne has to be labelled for all allergens and an alternative option be provided cooks have to keep information charts to show parents on request and parents themselves are prevented from bringing in homemade goods or foodstuffs not on the charts even for their own childrens birthday for underwood and wakefield it is a constant juggling act between implementing new policies every month which takes hours and therefore money and trying not to put our costs up too much because we are parents ourselves and we know what its like election pledges the election pledges made by the various parties to date include labours promise to increase free childcare for three and fouryearolds from hours to hours a week while the liberal democrats say they would give hours free childcare to all twoyearolds which is currently only available to lowincome parents of twoyearolds but from what i have seen of the accounts at my sons nursery this expansion of free childcare will benefit parents but fail to address the struggling small businesses that are trying to provide the promised services i have always felt that my nursery costs were reasonable given the amount of development i have seen in my son since he started attending part time aged six months but it is clear that the system is in need of major reform as there appears to be a mismatch between political promises of providing free childcare and the reality of enabling parents and providers to balance the books,2015-03,childcare twoyearold son cost year nursery somewhat

looking out over a sea of hands on a recent school visit i felt a warm rush of elation at the sight of every single pupil raising their arm to affirm that they were a feminist except thats not quite what happened in fact when i asked everybody who was a feminist to put their hand up the result was a paltry scattering or hands of the assembly hall at best so i asked the pupils to raise their hands if they thought everybody should be treated equally regardless of their sexuality and every hand in the room went up i asked them if everybody should be treated equally regardless of skin colour and again the response rate was finally i asked them to put their hand up if they thought everybody should be treated equally regardless of their sex everybody in the room raised an arm if you have your hand up now i explained then youre a feminist thats what feminism means apart from a few horrified boys who snatched their hands down in dismay the general reaction was one of bemusement several kids asked if boys were allowed to be feminists and others protested that they couldnt possibly be since feminism meant wanting women to defeat overtake or generally beat men into submission its not surprising that these outdated and false stereotypes persist given their stubborn repetition in the media and across the internet in fact there seems to be a huge amount of anxiety about the current resurgence of feminism and what it might mean for men in the past week alone we have seen wails that the sacking of jeremy clarkson points to an emasculated bbc articles proclaiming that un statistics on sexual violence unfairly malign men comment pieces that declare the real everyday sexism in the uk to be against men even russell crowe mourning the loss of traditional masculinity whats strange is that often at the heart of this panic is an entirely false dichotomy first such arguments suggest that tackling issues such as sexism street harassment or domestic violence somehow precludes action on problems that disproportionately affect men the idea that the fight for gender equality somehow erases masculinity or disempowers men seems to be strangely insulting to any man whose sense of identity doesnt come from being offensive to women feminism doesnt mean doors cant be held open any moreor the end of flirting or that men should never again pay a woman a compliment thats simple human kindness we should all show one another regardless of gender the idea that feminism must somehow result in either deliberate or collateral damage to men is simply not true almost every issue that feminists campaign about would have a positive knockon effect for men the entries to the everyday sexism project reveal this with brilliant clarity in the same week well receive one entry from a man refused parental leave and ridiculed in the office for asking for it and one from a woman who has been refused a promotion because she is considered a maternity risk we hear from girls who arent allowed to join in football games and boys who are bullied for wanting to take girly subjects such as art or drama we learn of fathers congratulated for babysitting their own children and mothers criticised for taking a night off many of these problems are so obviously two sides of the same coin the same is true for many of the issues that mens rights activists raise as exclusively male concerns with the suggestion that feminism ignores these problems invariably these include accusations of gender imbalance in the allocation of custody or the fact that the male suicide rate is several times higher than it is for women what they dont seem to realise is that these too are closely linked to the inequality that feminism seeks to address if there is an unfair bias towards female carers it likely stems from stereotypes about women being familyoriented and men being careerfocused it seems sensible to assume that at least some part of the gender disparity in suicide rates may be connected to the pervasive idea that men must be tough and strong that boys dont cry and its shameful for men to talk about their feelings or reach out for help tackling these stereotypes would be good for everybody it will slow us all down if people persist in peddling this outdated dogma that sets men and women up against each other of course not all men are sexist and not every woman will necessarily face sexism gender inequality has a negative impact on men as well as women though its structural and ingrained nature politically economically socially and culturally does mean that women tend to experience its effects more frequently and more severely there is a vital role for men to play in this battle and it isnt as detractors or naysayers but as allies agents of change and beneficiaries this isnt about men against women its about people against prejudice and everybody needs to get on board,2015-03,looking sea hand recent school visit felt warm rush elation sight every

fares even worse coming joint nd with panama while sweden th and finland th unsurprisingly score well it is tiny andorra rd with female mps that is the highest ranked european country worldwide only one in five mps are women and this week more than female parliamentarians from around the world meet in the ethiopian capital addis ababa to address the complex issue of getting more gender parity into our elected assemblies of the countries in the world where women account for more than a quarter of parliamentarians are in africa one possible reason for there being more female mps in countries not otherwise best known for equal society or female employment is that often these countries have accepted the need for quotas for female candidates in elections whereas many western countries including the uk prefer other tactics in rwanda of all candidates in elections must be women while in senegal since it is according to the ipu electoral quotas which have been used in more than countries have underpinned much of the global rise in women mps to date but last year saw the slowest increase so far and the ipu says other measures are needed to complement the use of quotas if progress is to be sustained but the conference in addis ababa is about more than just numbers and getting women into power the real isssue is what women do with that power once they have it and the potential impact of female leadership on policymaking the sessions at this years conference range include the practical such as media training for female politicians or how to answer stupid questions but mainly focus on the complex and interrelated challenges that face us all as global citizens how can we make sure that prosperity benefits everyone what kind of leadership will best help us tackle growing security risks around the world as nkosazana dlaminizuma who chairs the african union commission put it in her welcome to this years conference we are beginning to see a difference in the laws and policies in parliaments where we have a critical mass of women implementing those policies depends on public managers as much as politicians there isnt as much data on the number of women in public leadership roles as for political roles but figures collated by consultants ey formerly ernst and young on the g countries show that countries that tend to be strong on one indicator do well on both south africa is relatively high for women in senior positions in politics public sector leadership and private sector leadership a testament according to ey to the countrys strong framework of targets and affirmative action while canada which has the highest number of female public leaders in the world has a long history of taking positive action to promote underrepresented groups in public services perhaps its time for the uk to start learning from other countries about how to improve gender parity only one female parliamentarian mep linda mcavan is at the addis conference before international womens day on march journalist michael crick drew up a list of just over of the most influential posts in the uk that have never yet been held by a woman ranging from chancellor of the

what are the greatest threats to feminism today this question was put to me as a panellist at the bristol womens literature festival its difficult to answer because there are so many threats to the movement but first of all what do i even mean by feminism for me feminism is a global political movement for the liberation of women and society based on equality for all people although i use the word equality in that definition feminism is about so much more than that if feminism were solely about womens equality with men that would wrongly suggest that the world is just fine as it is that all men are doing great which they arent and that all women need to do is to get to where men are feminism is one of the oldest and most powerful social movements in history it is a revolutionary movement and that means change there is so much wrong with the present system that we cant just tinker round the edges we need to start again our end point cannot be equality in an unequal world this is also the reason why feminism is not struggling to simply reverse the present power relationship and put women in charge instead of men though this is a common myth about feminist politics feminism is about change not a changing of the guard if we are to correct our unbalanced world then we need to get rid of patriarchy as a system of social governance by patriarchy i mean male supremacy i mean a society where every avenue of power especially mainstream institutions of power is overwhelmingly dominated by men you dont have to go far to find this and it isnt a preserve of foreign countries or dictatorial regimes the uk is patriarchal just like the rest of the globe it may look different and take different forms but its the same old male supremacy westminster politics for example is nearly male and overwhelmingly white we are still waiting for a government that looks like the people it dares to govern business leaders the judiciary senior police management in education and the media wherever you look you will find that power is in male hands this is sexism base raw and simple it means that our society is shaped by one half of the population alone that it reflects aggrandises and normalises its group perspectives and its image of power but this power structure is cracked it always has been thats why it has to be constantly propped up through force violence and the threat of violence this ancient imbalance has brought us to the brink of planetary crisis it has ripped out chasms between countries and people the situation is not natural we cannot possibly look at things as they are and say so it was meant to be we should try to change it however we can and thats where feminism comes in the obvious threats to feminism today are the same as they have always been the main ones being the existence of patriarchy and the backlash from that system when it hits out against any challenges to its continuation however there are more insidious and less obvious threats these dangers hide in plain sight and come partly in the form of a version of feminism known as choice feminism this term is used to refer to a common phenomenon whereby the language of liberation taken from feminist political theory is turned on its head and used against women choice feminism can be found particularly in media representations of what feminism is and what womens empowerment might look like there is an attempt unfortunately fairly successful to reduce feminism to simply being the right for women to make choices not choices about whether to stand for parliament or instigate pay transparency in the office or lead an unemployed workers union or form a womenonly consciousnessraising group in their town far from it instead there are choices about what amount of makeup to wear whether to go natural or try mascara that makes your eyelashes look like false eyelashes or what diet drink to buy or whether or not to make the first move with a man or other such modern and edgy decisions of the sort which face the feisty sassy pullnopunches liberated woman of today excuse me while i am sick people make decisions every day they make them within a set of limited options and within a context that shapes not only what choices are on offer but also which ones are seen as most attractive or less risky people tend to make safe decisions ones that will not set them apart from others and ones that are socially sanctioned and rewarded also lets get real for a minute we actually make all sorts of boring decisions every second from whether or not to get a drink of water to whether or not to take an umbrella there is nothing inherently feminist in making decisions nor is it the case that by definition any choice a woman makes must be feminist simply because she is a woman enacting her supposed right to make choices thats not a right rights would be equal pay with the man sitting next to you doing the same job rights would be a country where the rapes committed every year no longer happen rights would be affordable childcare that doesnt cost over half your wages rights would be not having to put up with sexual harassment in the street on a daily basis rights would not be a society where two women are murdered every week by their male partners rights would not be getting surreptitiously sacked when you become pregnant what if we chose to be feminist what if we chose to organise together to change the world to something better what if we decided to finish the job our sisters started more than years ago and end the power imbalance between women and men that of course is the collective strength we represent the revolutionary potential that has to be tamed and distracted finn mackay is the author of radical feminism feminist activism in

a big thank you to our panel tonight for their time and thoughts and an even bigger thank you to you and all who watched and participated in the event tonight we had some really complex questions below the line and i want to thank everyone for such a constructive civilised discussion on a divisive topic if youre interested in attending guardian live events in the future head to guardian membership to learn more might see you there youre in the golden age ladies and gentlemen bonnie says this is the best time to be a woman this is the best time to be a man this is the best time to be a person of colour use it we didnt have anything before this is the best time right now use it and hand it on make our words turn into actions yas continues campaigning as a feminist doesnt need to be complex its about every small change you can make remember if you get a lift youve got to pull another person up bonnie says and engage a man laura says to laughter half the time feminism makes a headline it is because a celebrity mentioned it not always in agreement as lady gaga once said im not a feminist i hail men i love men i celebrate american male culture beer and bars and muscle cars well should celebrities talk about feminism they seem to be doing it a lot but yas is not impressed having one very very privileged woman say these things and having people go thats amazing that leaves behind the women who are fighting this on a grassroots level yas expresses an admiration for emma watson and her recent campaign with the un he for she but shares her dislike for russell brand prompting mass applause and other people who become martrys for a cause the people stomping out the people who are fighting for something every day bonnie talks about her mentor norman mailer the infamously gruff masculine author and playwright one day she asked him about his character his macho mask why do you do this she asked gesturing to her body fear what else he replied he called it fear but he was brave enough to say that to my face she says engaging with men i dont know what that means i love men i have lots of male friends and i enjoy them i am fucking amazed by all of you she says to the room you have to deal with so many complex questions and problems these days i salute you but this about humanity we have a short time here and we have to live together is there another way of thinking about it asks beatrix is there anyone in this room who doesnt worry about what patriarchy produces the things we encounter every day there is no one in this space who doesnt engage with men there isnt a society where women hold institutional power in britain weve probably got one of the best pieces of legislation on sexual crime in the world ten years on were told by researchers that rape is effectively decriminalised rape is a crime committed by men not all men some men and we employ people to police this and sort it out the duty to engage with men sits with the criminal justice system because these problems are products of masculinity but they dont do it so it falls to us it doesnt fall to the un it falls to us feminism is very interested in men and masculinity how could it not be she brings up another audience question about men taking on more feminine roles in the house men themselves have not initiated any mass movement to enable them to take care of their children to be parents rather than providers microphones are going around the room for more audience questions including one man who calls himself a refugee from planet patriarchy we must discuss the problems that boys have bonnie says citing the ways they are pushed into masculine tropes like sports as feminists we must have discussions about men and masculinity i get trolled a lot by young men she continues i just speak to them as if they are human and it disarms them they dont expect that they expect a fight they constantly have to define manhood not just in their houses but everywhere online on the street corner are you a man are you a man are you a man applause around the room beatrix goes back to the previous question about boys and their feelings on feminism boys are invited daily and every minute to polarise their sensibilities about what it means to be a boy i saw a child aged six wearing a shirt that said boys rule imagine if that said whites rule or muslims rule were experiencing a very polarising time about what it means to be a man the idea that boys might identify with girls is inconceivable right now theyre just princesses theyre in waiting the great thing is that people are on to it we know that our definitions of what it means to be masculine or feminine are destructive jane says she is not proporn despite being labelled as such before none of the men involved in the porn framework are discussing women doing it for themselves or true depictions of lgbtq pornography i know were not doing enough to control it to bring respect to pornography beatrix brings up page sharing the fact that the topless feature began in the same year the first womens liberation conference was held in britain it was rupert murdochs riposte to feminism in britain it is not about the glorification of women we should be absolutely confident in our repudiation of page she likens it to ahem a woman failing to orgasm during sex this is not about preventing pleasure it is about giving women the chance to have some she says to applause while calling anais nin a cryptofascist bonnie says she admires how she found a language to examine female sexuality the expression of female sexuality is narrowed by how it is effected by the male gaze that term is not about gender that is a way of looking we have to celebrate ourselves as women you have to find this in yourself and glorify the women who find their own language to do it and celebrate that were beginning to ask these questions can i experience pleasure can i feel joy these are ancient questions explored by virigina woolf and other women before but we have to discuss them again and again definitely in my experience at school says yas and if they are interested they will be bullied into being not interested the amount of people i speak to who say oh but women are equal now they have the vote what is this the resurgence of feminism in the last few years is reassuring but i hope it is not a trend it needs to grow talking about it is incredible but we need to engage with people who dont see themselves as feminists she brings up her role as a campaigner for better sex and gender education in schools anything to do with feminism at school all we talk about is the suffragettes and even then the word feminism is never really mentioned we should start those discussions at that crucial time when youre starting to establish your own opinions separate to your parents the microphone is going around the room were getting a great question from a and year old who has been a feminist all her life laura bates brings up a question from a online commentor spinningbeams why do more and more people eschew the label of feminism and refer to themselves as equal rights proponents or humanists the most infuriating thing about that label equalism is it assumes victimisation beatrix says all men should be feminists the best thing a man can do is be a feminist itll extend your life as a man its easy bonnie says to laughter bonnie cites the monetary reward some movements receive for holding contrarian view we are developing a new narrative laura raises a question posted by commentor roding i would like to hear more about why some women do appear to hate feminism it seems inexplicable to me as they probably have had jobs custody of their kids the vote or say a bank account beatrix talks about finding the sexism and violence women can encounter online a revelation women are being maligned with an intensity that takes your breath away this new platform is fantastic but it is also fantastic for those who put about the most vile misogyny they dont need to leave the house they dont need to buy a stamp they dont need to come to an event like this and face us i think germaine greer must be feeling quite vindicated she compares the second wave of feminism online to the fourth wave she calls the modern fight for feminism a fight for breath for any of you look at you she says gesturing to the room fantastic women so accomplish so skilled you want to save our lovely planet and save yourselves and save men but to come here you had to confront something difficult about yourself you dont want to have to tell your daughters that this isnt fair its more than that it may cost them their lives jane fae weighs in on the impact of technology on modern feminism the internet is a panopticon everyone sees everything you do and you begin to police yourself she brings up jon ronsons latest book so youve been publicly shamed and cites the extreme reaction she encountered online after she made a mistake in a tweet it can make you bland and that is a problem bonnie raises the issue of making assumptions about women and their view on feminism based on their appearances part of values and part of being a feminist is to ask these questions that the patriarchy takes for granted and does not ask she says she mentions the muslim students she has met at her university and notes she can not see any veiled women in the room if you see a woman walking around veiled we can not make assumptions about these women it is very important to identify what women want to say and what they dont want to say my feminism is to say who isnt here and why arent they here are young women more hesitant to identify as feminists yas says the internet has made feminism more accessible than ever identifying tumblr as a good forum for young feminists i love that the internet exists so we can discuss feminism in a nonacademic way i think that is making it much easier i am talking about the good stuff rather than the bad stuff laura asks the room if to raise their hands if they identify as feminists about of the room raises their hands wow laura says sounding surprised enough to raise a laugh while she cant speak for all young people yas says she feels the pressure of sexualisation is oppressive the media and social media and online porn all these different sources are great influences on society and young people they project this patriarchy in really subtle ways and over time it becomes normalised and thats how things are it seems like there isnt a massive problem but there is fifteen years ago you couldnt get this many women to talk about feminism bonnie says it was a dirty word she brings up sex and the city which she didnt like but found it fascinating to watch the women around her form fantasies around the show i can see the sexualisation of young women around me i am interested whether this is the pressure that has moved people to talk about feminism beatrix says we are currently living through a new historical sexual settlement there is nowhere in the world where that isnt true she says identifying asia and china these are places where inequalities and oppressions experienced by women are accelerating bonnie calls the uk as deeply patriarchial beatrix disagrees neoliberalism has converged and works with neopatriarchy to produce a new world order jane identifies her knitting circle as a example of a female support structure the real danger is teaching people that theyre in it for themselves the panel has moved onto the polarity around the definition of feminism as commentor sirhumphreybuttons put it btl i think its perfectly possible to have a feminist outlook but not to like the label any political isn carries the stigma of dogmatic inflexible thinking and peoples political identities are increasingly towards individual flexible and independent thought and away from proscribed ways of thinking were starting with each of

leading female lawmakers and womens groups are turning up the pressure on new york governor andrew cuomo to help pass a paid family leave law in the state a group including state senators assemblywomen and more than a dozen local and national womens organizations sent a letter to the governor last thursday urging him to show support for paid leave the letter was a response to recent remarks by cuomo alleging that albany lacks the appetite to debate such a policy we respectfully disagree thursdays letter read a second letter bearing a dozen more signatures and a similar message was delivered on monday americas lack of paid family leave stands in stark contrast to most of the rest of the world as the guardian reported last year the us is the only developed country that doesnt guarantee paid maternity or parental leave to its citizens every other oecd nation including mexico offers at least weeks of available paid leave for new and expectant mothers australia offers weeks of paid time off the uk offers weeks and other nations offer even more generous benefits because a national policy is lacking several states have taken action on their own during the s and s six states including new york and puerto rico established disability benefits through which expectant and new mothers could also access paid maternity leave but only three states california new jersey and rhode island have since passed and implemented fullscale family leave policies these policies include up to six weeks paid leave for fathers as well as adopted and foster parents and give more time off for mothers the laws also guarantee paid time off for workers who need to care for ailing family members among other provisions washington state passed a paid family leave law in but never implemented it due to lack of a funding mechanism this year two competing proposals for paid family leave have been introduced by democrats and republicans in the new york legislature one in the assembly and the other in the senate a similar bill passed the assembly last year but supporters are making a more concerted push this time around supporters hope to capitalize on momentum from barack obamas recent push for paid leave theres a lot of political momentum right now said sherry leiwant cofounder and copresident of a better balance a signee on last weeks letter to cuomo below we compare the main points in the two competing new york state bills to current programs in three other states the republicanbacked paid family leave bill passed the state senate last week the democrats bill will likely pass in the assembly again according to the new york times but reconciling the two plans and overcoming opposition from business interests in the state are two major hurdles on the way to enacting paid family leave in the state if cuomo and lawmakers in albany are able to muster up the appetite to push a law through to the end new york will be the fourth us state to implement paid family leave and many families will almost certainly breathe a sigh of relief,2015-03,leading female lawmaker womens group turning pressure new york governor andrew cuomo help pas paid family leave

when i started writing for the womens blog an empathetic friend sent me an email containing a single line of advice in block capitals never read the comments while i appreciated the protective sentiment and do occasionally reflect on its wisdom ive found the engagement of readers to be one of the most revealing and educational parts of this journey one of my most surprising discoveries has been the universal joy of a cheese pun but writing the blog has taught me plenty more besides youre never as alone as you think you are society has an incredible knack for making people who face inequality feel alone women who speak up about sexism are told they need to get a sense of humour women who protest about workplace discrimination are accused of rocking the boat women whove been sexually assaulted are told they must have been asking for it the past few years have shown me how many people experience injustice in silence each made to feel they dont have the right to speak up but the more women speak out and stand up the harder it is to silence us some people really hate womens voices when i started writing about sexism the responses shocked me people told me where and when theyd rape me they said i was a slut who deserved to die they listed the weapons theyd use they threatened to hurt my family unsurprisingly this hurt the most politicians told me im too glass half empty and newspaper picture editors said they needed to make me look as sexy as possible i spoke at a school where an entire hall of boys wolf whistled as i walked on stage and i gave a speech where a mens rights activist mra handed out fliers to the audience calling me a liar it hasnt been the easiest ride the future of feminism is in good hands reactions from teenage girls have been overwhelming theyve set up feminist societies written articles in school newspapers and started campaigns on everything from everyday sexism to fgm after i speak at schools they email me with lists of the harassment and assault theyve experienced sometimes only one or two girls will admit to being feminists often they face sexist jibes and taunts about feminazis but they still speak up their courage is inspiring these are not womens issues theyre human rights issues one of the nicest surprises has been the compassionate responses from men many described their own experiences like being ridiculed in the office for asking for parental leave others said their eyes had been opened and shared their strategies for challenging sexism from protesting about sexist chants at their local football club to lifting their own tshirts when a woman in the street was told to get your tits out its not about men against women but people against prejudice preconceptions about feminism are hard to break old friends have stopped themselves telling a joke in front of me in case i get offended new acquaintances assume i must be perpetually furious or detest men several mras nearly exploded with the contradiction when i recently married a man strangers have warned that i may one day kill my children burn down the house steal my husbands money and run off with a coven of lesbian witches yes really sisterhood is strong people tell me that women are their own worst enemy and whats really holding us back is how much we bitchy girls hate one anothers success which is weird because im supported by the most incredible people in the feminist community and never could have got everyday sexism off the ground without the support of an amazing group of volunteers these women know the power of humour in the face of trolling and when humour fails they know the power of gin lowlevel sexism impacts womens lives on a daily basis people say there are specific issues feminists should focus on and others that they shouldnt make a fuss about but the overwhelming response to every article ive written on street harassment shows that the minor things have a massive cumulative impact the question im most frequently asked is whats the worst everyday sexism entry but its impossible to rank these experiences we must tackle every form of inequality one of feminisms greatest strengths is its capacity to fight many battles at once antifeminists dont get irony one commenter said of me sexism doesnt exist shes just a bitch who needs some dick to shut up i felt so silly i wished someone had pointed this out sooner before i wasted so much time and energy campaigning theres still a long way to go before i started writing about sexism i was working as an actress turning up at furniture advert auditions to be told weve decided to sex it up a bit and now youre taking your top off now im lucky enough to work with politicians universities and police forces on issues i feel passionate about but theres still so much to do were working on new international branches of the project and i desperately want to persuade the government to commit to compulsory sex and relationships education how can we teach kids about composting and calculus but not about consent my greatest ambition is to reach a point where sexism is so socially unacceptable that there isnt anything left to blog about but that might be some time coming humour can be a powerful weapon some of the most effective comebacks are those that pierce prejudice with wit my favourite feminist joke

working parents can apply to share maternity leave from april under new rules aimed at offering greater flexibility in how they care for their children in their first year shared parental leave is designed to challenge the oldfashioned assumption that women will always be the parent that stays at home said nick clegg when he announced the change months ago it is expected to encourage more women to go back to work and persuade fathers to take time off to look after their children here we consider what the rules mean for couples with a baby on the way and prospective adoptive parents how will the rules work parents will be allowed to split up to weeks off work after having a baby or adopting mothers will take the first two weeks the compulsory part of maternity leave however it will be possible to transfer the remaining maternity leave to the father or in theory share it this right will only be available to couples if both work which critics say rules out many parents according to a tuc study two out of five new fathers with a child under the age of one or wont be eligible because the mother doesnt have a paid job what has changed at present parents are able to share some maternity leave with the father allowed to take up to six months after the child reaches weeks but under the new rules mothers could return to work before this passing on any maternity allowance to the father they could switch at a later date if they choose fathers will still be entitled to two weeks of paternity leave however additional paternity leave will now be replaced with shared parental leave what about pay unless your employer offers an enhanced package pay will be at the statutory level this is of your average weekly earnings before tax for the first six weeks then a week from april or of your average weekly earnings whichever is lower for the next weeks in total of the weeks will be paid some say the rules could be detrimental to the potential for enhanced pay lucy mclynn an employment lawyer at bates wells braithwaite says many employers enhance statutory maternity entitlements but will be disinclined to do so for shared parental leave perhaps fearing that there would be a massive takeup of such entitlements from eligible male employees meanwhile frances ogrady of the tuc stresses that unless shared leave is backed up with better pay couples simply wont be able to afford to take it will employers agree to it parents will be required to give their employer eight weeks notice of their intention to take leave there will be a cap on requesting separate blocks of time off at three per employee provided you give the right notice employers cannot refuse leave but they can refuse discontinuous blocks of leave as coming and going over the year will cause disruption for them says marian bloodworth an employment lawyer at berwin leighton paisner for example if someone asks for two nonconsecutive monthlong periods an employer that cannot accommodate this pattern is entitled to refuse it the employee can then decide whether to withdraw the request take the leave in one block of two months or ask for a different pattern are our jobs at risk there are rules to stop you losing your job while on maternity leave and these will apply to both parents women are currently entitled to return to the same job if they take up to weeks of maternity leave both parents will have the right to take that much time off and return to their role under the new rules this applies even if the leave is not taken in one block so a parent could take off two separate sets of weeks and still have the same right can we change our minds a mother who has said she plans to share her leave can change her mind within six weeks of her childs birth otherwise apart from limited exceptions once employees have opted into shared parental leave they cannot then revert to maternity leave bloodworth says can we be off together parents can take weeks concurrently while the idea of being off at the same time may be attractive both parents will be using up the leave and potentially the pay entitlements more quickly than if just the mother was off bloodworth says this means women may need to return to work sooner than they would have if they had stayed on maternity leave for the full entitlement do we get keep in touch days a woman on maternity leave will still be able to go into work for days without ending her statutory leave and pay in addition there will be days for each parent on shared parental leave case study it sounds great in theory polly and dan moult both are expecting their second child in may they would like to take advantage of the new rules but believe only a few parents will be able to i know dan was heartbroken having to leave emily at just a few weeks old for the first time to return to work so it would be great if he could share the first years care polly says but the likelihood of being able to do this depends on whether you work for a company big enough to have other employees picking up the slack dan works as an nhs consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care while polly is a consultant in sport and exercise medicine his job is very demanding and he has just started at a new hospital she says the timing wouldnt look brilliant to even ask for this benefit the change sounds great in theory but it could prove tricky

domestic abuse victims are being let down and unnecessarily exposed to intimidation and confrontation in court abused women cannot get legal aid say mps march a parliamentary committee found last week that the most vulnerable are forced to represent themselves and face their abuser in court thanks to unrealistic time restrictions on abuse evidence to qualify for a legal aid lawyer as a criminal lawyer i am astonished at the ministry of justices double standards on the one hand it imposes a time limit of two years since their last beating on any victim of domestic abuse receiving legal aid on the other hand it allows for timeless eligibility of bad character in criminal proceedings this is where a defendants distant past whether convicted or not can be used to bolster even the most evidentially weak prosecutions a defendants offending in can be used against a complainant but that person may not get legal aid in the family courts because the incident is deemed too long ago this topsyturviness highlights how damaging criminal legal aid cuts will be for oncall solicitor work leading many more people facing charges to appear unrepresented when confronted with legal tripwires such as the limitless admissibility of bad character diy defendants will increasingly later appeal against conviction and doubtless miscarriages of justice will creep up dont say we didnt warn you jonathan black president london criminal courts solicitors association while leading everywoman safe everywhere the labour partys womens safety commission which reported at the end of i discovered that of domestic violence survivors do not meet the completely arbitrary evidence threshold brought in by the secretary of state for justice chris grayling and therefore cannot get legal aid this is to enable the victim to pursue such things as parenting arrangements for their children financial support for them and the familys housing arrangements these changes meant that a person making an allegation needed separate and very specific categories of evidence in addition to their own testimony by definition much domestic violence occurs between two people away from public view and the specific nature of the evidence requirements strongly suggests that this is not a qualifying process but a way of rationing access to funds a photograph taken by a police officer of a physical injury such as a bruise or black eye is no longer considered sufficient evidence for example the government has always argued that there is an exceptional payment system to help victims who cannot meet these requirements but the justice select committee found that only of such applications were granted between april and september as owen bowcotts article rightly states the committee concludes that the exceptional payments system doesnt work combined with the cumulative effect of governmentforced local authority funding cuts for refuges shortterm funding for rape crisis centres and housing and welfare reforms this has resulted in a chaotic poorly coordinated system in which the already marginalised victims of domestic violence and their dependents continue to fall through the net vera baird

mums it seems just want to have fun fed up with bearing the lionesss share of household tasks and parenting responsibilities most women with dependent children say in a survey that what they really really want for mothers day is the chance to rebel perhaps that is not so surprising the study shows that women would far rather be rulebreakers than housekeepers and resent the fact that dads get to play the fun parent role far more than they do in a survey conducted by advertising agency saatchi amp saatchi for the parenting website mumsnet mothers were asked to define their roles and to detail how much time they spent in each mumsnet users and panels involving parents came up with eight defined categories to cover the jobs involved in parenting carer safehouse partner in crime friend hero coach fan and rulebreaker the overwhelming result was that mothers say they do not get to spend as much time in the fun roles as the men and are unhappy about that with stating they want to carve out more time as a partner in crime and wanting to spend more time as a rulebreaker currently only of mothers time is spent as partner in crime and only breaking the rules but with of mums saying that they provide all eight of the emotional roles entirely on their own in their household they just dont have the time for the fun side the research also recorded that of all the mothers surveyed those who work outside the home and those who stay at home with their children said they take the main responsibility for parenting in their household among those working fulltime of mothers also said they take the main responsibility for their children every day while that rose to of stayathome mothers but all of them said they wished they had more time to break the rules hang the housework and have spontaneous anarchic fun with their kids at the moment dads biggest involvement is in the emotional roles of rulebreaker of women said their childrens father currently played this role and partner in crime while mothers were still mostly involved in providing the carer safehouse and hero roles among the mums said they provided the carer role but only said that the childrens dad spent any time in this role at all rulebreaker is the emotional role that mothers occupy the least previous studies have shown that mothers feel their choice over how much time they spend with children has been removed about of mothers who work fulltime would rather work less either parttime or not at all in order to see more of their children but that choice has more or less been eradicated the latest mumsnet survey has been carried out ahead of mumstock a conference in london this week which has been designed to explain modern parental roles to businesses seeking to market to mothers richard huntington the chief strategy officer of saatchi amp saatchi said advertisers are still stuck in the rut of seeing mums in the role of cook cleaner and nurse while dad has fun playing outside and getting messy with his kids he added while its true that most mothers still take on more parental responsibility than their partners there is far more to their relationship with their children than most advertising recognises we need to focus more on the fun and silliness of motherhood and less on the drudgery if we are to reflect the reality of modern mothers aspirations justine roberts the founder of mumsnet which is celebrating its th anniversary this month said it was clear many mothers harbour a desire just to be able to kick back against the drudgery and be more fun nobody becomes a mother so that she can learn to produce the ultimate tuna pasta bake said roberts for all the hard graft that it entails parenthood is an emotional journey and mums and dads are playing all sorts of different roles in their childrens lives from carer to playmate to role model its clear though from our research that mums would like the dads to do a bit more of the rulemaking so mums can do more of the

the liberal democrat minister for women and equalities has accused the conservatives of blocking an independent review into sexism in the media jo swinson said her plan was not a call for censorship but hit out at editorial decisions such as using photos of a murder victim in a bikini and language used to describe successful women in a speech at the partys conference in liverpool she claimed the conservatives were either happy with how things are or feared a backlash in the press if the review went ahead this is not a call for censorship this is not a call for editorial agendas to bow down to government diktat this is a call for an independent review chaired by media representatives to work with government and other stakeholders to take this issue seriously swinson linked violence against women to the everyday sexism faced by many on a daily basis this underlying current of sexism and abuse is the environment in which violence against women is endemic she said two women a week are killed by their partners or expartners in the uk one in five teenage girls have suffered physical violence or intimidation from boyfriends and have experienced sexual harassment at school or college and yet the media will illustrate a story about the murder of a young woman with a photo of her in a bikini girls were routinely socialised not to put themselves forward or put their heads above the parapet the minister told delegates is it any wonder that years later when it comes to negotiating a pay rise or putting themselves forward for promotion the women might be less likely to do so swinson asked we also have a wider culture that values women primarily for how they look while promoting an ideal look which is at best timeconsuming and at worst impossible to achieve ive heard yearold girls say they arent comfortable going to school unless theyve spent an hour doing their makeup think what that hour a day could achieve for a schoolgirl in terms of learning exercise sleep or building friendships swinson admitted that the lib dems whose mps included just seven women needed to do more to get women involved in politics generally the mp for east dunbartonshire could face a difficult battle to retain her seat given the poor lib dem performance in opinion polls she won in and retained the seat five years later with a majority over labour a fall of,2015-03,liberal democrat

why was the productivity commission given the role of assessing the childcare sector childcare essentially delivers a community service which the productivity commission is not best placed to measure this became particularly clear when the recommendations in the commissions final report failed to incorporate the needs of the users children and families into the essential principles for the running of childcare services as their first priority childcare services must value and serve the wellbeing of children not just increase gross domestic production justifying some of the expenditure on care for kids because it releases mothers for paid work is fine as long as we recognise that childrens services meet wider needs including providing quality care for all the kids that use them the productivity commissions report reveals a conflict between benefits for users versus the benefits for investors in childcare in a free market these factors too often conflict thats what governments are there for to provide and regulate services that are inappropriate for markets to provide childcare is one such service and is the reason we have to ignore many of the competitionbased recommendations in the latest productivity commission report they got it wrong we did once have a fairly good model for childcare which was primarily offered by notforprofit community organisations it was a service first and foremost designed to support families and was federally funded from the early s after funding for fee relief was extended to commercial services in and direct funding for community organisations abolished in this sector exploded with cowboy investors prior to this change part of the funding was conditional on services being located where needed charging an approved range of fees and employing appropriately qualified staff this model ensured that places for particular age and needs groups were available the move to funding parents through fee relief ended this era of careful planning the extension of funding for fee relief to commercial services and the loss of capital funding means expansion over the past two decades has been mainly in the commercial area it was these commercial operators that lobbied governments for the lifting of restrictions from early in this century there were no more controls over where childcare centres were to be located the types of services on offer or the age groups to be catered for the result of the past two decades of growth is some significant maldistribution shortages of services in high cost locations widely different fee levels lack of places for higher cost under twoyearolds and the growth of focus on the investment returns for shareholders and property developers the idea of childcare services as community services per se has completely disappeared from the language at the federal funding level i recognise however it would be hard to unwind the commercial sector which now provides the bulk of services an alternative is a hybrid model the reintroduction of partial control over planning and funding so that defined needs can be met at reasonable costs this used to be called a planning model now its called a supply model the productivity commission has defined this new model very carefully and even offers proof of its widespread use and effectiveness quoting an oecd review which concluded that supplyside funding mechanisms may lead to better outcomes for children and families the evidence suggests that direct public funding of services brings more effective governmental steering of early childhood services advantages of scale better national quality more effective training for educators and a higher degree of equity in access compared with parent subsidy models despite quoting the advantages of some level of direct government controls the productivity commission rejects their use for no good reason except claiming families want it without any evidence and maybe ideological commitments to market models but a judicious mix of markets and government controls may still be the best way to meet the needs for accessible and affordable services in high cost areas and for children under two a hybrid model could work like this the government contracts to pay the service provider an agreed proportion say of an approved budget conditional on the agreed service mix hours and location this would separately include eligibility for meanstested fee relief so the government could ensure that the communities needs and its own were adequately met services would be guaranteed an adequate return on capital and labour and retain the right to use extra funds and earnings to improve services instead of pay profits parents would find the services they need and funding budgets would ensure extra resources for meeting approved higher costs needs this model means all win and it will probably cost very little more than the present mess,2015-03,wa productivity commission given

one of the most common derisive taunts thrown at feminists and one of the oldest is manhater its been around since the days of suffrage and still gets used today though its a pretty anodyne insult most feminists like me shun the label and work to convince people that despite the stereotypes feminists absolutely without a doubt do not hate men but so what if we did its not that i recommend hating men or think it a particularly wise use of ones time but to each her own straight white men still hold the majority of political economic and social power in the world and everyone else struggles to make their lives work with less so if the worst thing that happens to a man is that a woman doesnt like him well he has it pretty damn good its not as if were living in some sort of wicker maninspired dystopia after all besides when women hate men we hurt their feelings when men hate women they kill us mass shootings have been attributed to misogyny and sexual and domestic violence against women is often fuelled by a hatred for women thats why its so hard to take seriously any claims that misandry is a tremendous problem theyre based on the idea that merely insulting men is similar to the lifethreatening misogyny women face worldwide most recently newsday writer cathy young argued that men being called mansplainers or rape apologists is akin to the rape and death threats that women get online but a younger generation of feminists has embraced what slate writer amanda hess calls ironic misandry hess wrote last year that the rise in popularity of male tears mugs and manhating inspired shirts and crafts serves as a sort of fuckyou to the constant barrage of harassment that feminists often face on its most basic level ironic misandry functions like a stuckout tongue pointed at a playground bully guardian contributor jess zimmerman and selfproclaimed misandrist witch told hess its inhabiting the most exaggerated implausible distortion of your position in order to show that its ridiculous in other words calling ourselves misandrists is both a way of reappropriating one of the most common insults feminists weather and a way to blow off some steam after a long day of fighting the same battles we did years ago and honestly if feminists really hated men wed probably come up with a better way to hurt them than funny tshirts that insist that their tears are delicious men may have some very sensitive parts but even the manhatingest among us doesnt go around kicking them willynilly despite all the funloving internetinjoke misandry the vast majority of women and feminists do not hate men many of us might hate bad men the sexists misogynists and allaround jerks but our hatred is just a feeling and not something that can impact men in any meaningful or oppressive way men who claim to be genuinely worried about manhating or misandry are grasping at straws and searching for a victim status that simply doesnt exist guys are still doing pretty well so let us have our manhating fun while you go on ruling the world but keep one eye open just kidding sort of,2015-03,one common derisive taunt thrown feminist one oldest manhater around since day

john bailey a graduate student at rutgers university in new jersey and brenna harvey a grad student at the university of connecticut are showing a group an even mix of men and women mostly in their s mostly graduate students studying gender the fruits of their research into bronies men who like my little pony they have been studying a particularly extreme subset of bronies they explain men who fetishise the ponies the pair bring up a screengrab one brony has posted a picture of a my little pony wearing sunglasses and drinking lemonade by a pool in the comments beneath the poster has made the fatal mistake at least within this community of admitting that he lost his wizard eligibility years ago has had sex with a person and that he does not clop that is masturbate to the images another brony had responded immediately go be normal somewhere else faggot it is the second day of the international conference on masculinities an annual meeting of the best and the brightest in the field of masculinity research this year the conference is being held in new york city at the roosevelt hotel in manhattan the conference is hosted by the center for the study of men and masculinities at stony brook university in conjunction with three other organisations which are also broadly working to improve gender equality by researching or engaging men hundreds of academics and activists will attend sessions over four days facebook chief operating officer and feminist sheryl sandberg fresh from launching her leanintogether campaign for gender equality is among the speakers and author naomi wolf is chairing a session it turns out that stories like those of bailey and harvey about repressive masculinity manifesting itself in the most unlikely of situations are quite common even in a group of selfdescribed nerds who meet up to fight each other with foam swords there are parallels to the ways women are held back in more mainstream society but the conference will offer some hope for men too in one presentation attendees learn that shed ownership is proving a real boon to gender equality in ireland in another we learn that some men in the us are showing real progress in friendship labs designed to teach men how to be friends with one another bailey and harvey had found that there was a community on the imagebased bulletin board chan of men who like my little pony within this community having sex with a real person in real life is seen as a negative and not clopping is a form of heresy what was happening here was an example of normal hegemonic masculinity in action bailey and harvey said the term hegemonic masculinity is used a lot here it is the theory of how men manage to assume and retain dominant positions in society at the expense of women being a hegemonic male means being powerful dominant stoic successful like the actors arnold schwarzenegger or jason statham it is about not being weird or different men strive to attain this ideal and as they do so women are held back bailey and harvey found that even men who fancy my little pony cartoon characters are likely to scrap with each other using similar terms and putdowns to normal men even to the point of using the same terminology such as faggot to police their environment after the talk bailey tells me that one of the main takeaways from the pairs research is that it adds to the understanding of how and why even young men can reject feminism so aggressively and so vehemently men have a hard time buying the notion that there is a patriarchy that there is male privilege he says the feminist talking points dont make any sense to them i think its something that the feminist movement and feminist allies need to be cognisant of and aware of and find a way to talk past that one of the people in the feminist movement who is attempting to talk past that resistance is sandberg i collared her before the conferences official opening gala she has managed to get some of the most popular sportsmen in the us basketball player lebron james for one to back her lean in campaign which combines an element of educating men about the plight of women with a carrotandstick approach to encouraging them to improve it we have to help men see that equality is not just the right thing to do but actually beneficial for them sandberg said men who lean in at work and support women do better according to sandberg its the same in the home one of the most notable parts of her campaign is its introduction of the word choreplay introducing men to the idea that those of them who share the housework and childcare with their partners get more sex than those who do not using sex as a tool for gender equality feels like a distant proposition the next day as i listen in on a presentation entitled epic glory and manhood acts in fantasy role playing dagorhir as a case study dagorhir is a battle recreation game think tolkien game of thrones says speaker james martin a sociology graduate student at the indiana university of pennsylvania and there is a photograph on an overhead projector of a singularly unthreatening looking battle troop they are standing in a field carrying foam shields and spears and swords martin has spent the past year researching one group of dagorhir enthusiasts at the indiana university of pennsylvania he wanted to find out if like bailey and harveys clopping bronies they acted differently from other men because im a nerd i was able to get more unique conversations martin says of his subjects martin found out that the dagorhir group conformed to masculine norms in several ways one of the most significant heartbreakingly was in how they dealt with what seems to have been a nearconstant barrage of insults from nondagorhir playing hecklers the group would cope by ignoring the insults pretending they were unhurt by them pushing their feelings down deep inside they were showing stoicism refusing to show anxiety hallmarks of hegemonic masculinity one of the recurring themes of the conference is the sense that men are not doing too well for themselves as hard as these men might try to escape a traditional boysdontcry toughguy version of masculinity by becoming obsessed with my little pony or calling themselves nerds and running around a field in fancy dress they are always influenced by it this is reinforced a couple of hours later when i attend a talk called breaking the male code how close male friendships can change mens lives i am expecting to hear examples of great male friendships and the benefits of this like the us illusionists and entertainers penn and teller or batman and robin instead robert garfield a psychiatrist therapist and psychiatry lecturer at the university of pennsylvania tells us that men in the modern age are lonely they want to speak to their male friends about their feelings but they do not its that idea of the stoic male again emotional intimacy skills are not godgiven they are not in the nature of men garfield says he has just written a book called breaking the male code and he shows us a slide from his research which states that more than of men want greater emotional closeness in their male friendships in his friendship labs garfield teaches men how to be friendly with one another attendees use a feelings wheel to identify how they are feeling they come to his sessions once a week garfield says the hardest part is when they try to apply what they have learned when they are hanging out with their unsuspecting buddies at a talk called engaging men and boys for gender equality i had expected a lot of activisttype rhetoric about getting men to sign up for emails or turn up at marches or wear badges but much of the discussion i heard was about identifying what was wrong with men and working to fix it i learned that its quite hard being a man presumably most men dont want to conform to a state of being an arsehole but often we still do men lose out in our patriarchal society too it seems doomed to repeat a set of male behaviours they didnt even know existed and perhaps it is only when we men better understand ourselves that we can really be happy whether thats in dressing up and fighting each other with foam swords clopping away to my little pony characters or just hanging around with the guys trying to explain to them what youve learned from the feelings

a review in which a customer described seeing a manager biting a waitress and slapping her on the bottom has been removed by tripadvisor for contravening its guidelines christina fowler of bedford left the review on tripadvisor on march also international womens day after eating at the bell at westoning in bedfordshire in her original review she wrote today on international womens day i saw the pub owner bite a young waitress on the shoulder which she tried to shrug off but then appeared to complain to her fellow waitress five minutes later he slaps her on the bum and made kissy noises when she jumped a huge reminder that we still need feminism even in shortly after it was posted fowler received a rebuttal from the pubs manageress which led to her posting the exchange on twitter i posted it on twitter and it spread like wildfire from there said fowler the review gained even more traction on social media after it was featured on tech website shinyshiny then after more than recommendations it was taken down on tuesday night with fowler receiving an apparently automated email saying the review was removed because it was not relevant to trip planning and research fowler said i was quite surprised i dont really understand what was wrong with it i was allowed to repost it in the end removing the words misogynist and feminist but i dont see that either of those words are particularly shocking tripadvisor spokesman james kay said the review was removed because it breached guidelines which asks reviewers to refrain from personal political ethical or religious commentary he added to be clear the review was not removed because the reviewers firsthand experience was considered irrelevant in fact we encouraged the reviewer to resubmit their review in order that their experience be shared with the travel community fowlers new review was posted on march the original review met an angry response from the restaurants manageress posted using the tripadvisor account of its manager roberto perrini now deleted along with the post it read on tripadvisor we are not here to discuss or comment on feminism or who makes kissy noises the latter is something we believe preschool children may discuss it is such a shame that you spent your time focusing on your feministic views and not our food had you done so you may have actually found something interesting to write about that would be of interest to others perrini told the guardian the incident was taken out of context and that part of the appeal of his restaurant was that he and his staff are like a family to one another he also said the bite was a fake bite with no harm meant he added i bite them they bite me were like a family im the same with the boys and the girls my manageress was very upset which was why she posted the response if you look at our reviews they are mostly five star reviews and thats not just about our food its about the atmosphere we create the reason we are successful is because our customers come here and feel at home when i saw the review i didnt really know what to say about it,2015-03,review customer described seeing manager biting waitress slapping bottom ha

more than a third of victims of domestic violence cannot provide the evidence required to obtain legal aid according to a parliamentary watchdog without support from a lawyer victims find it hard to leave abusive partners are exposed to intimidation and may have to confront attackers in court if left unrepresented the justice select committee warned on thursday the report focuses on one of the most controversial impacts of the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act laspo which the committee says has harmed access to justice for some litigants the act withdrew legal aid for family law cases except for those who provide evidence of domestic violence in the previous two years evidence can consist of a conviction police caution protective injunction letter from a health professional residence in a refuge and other categories of information the select committee says that nonetheless women often find it hard to prove they have been abused or attacked the report cites a survey conducted by the rights of women organisation which found that of women who were victims of domestic violence had none of the forms of evidence required to qualify for legal aid the select committee recommends introducing an additional catchall clause giving the legal aid agency discretion to grant legal aid to any victim of domestic violence who does not fit within the current criteria the artificiality of the two year time limit imposed by the act should be relaxed mps urge given the lasting impact domestic abuse can have on victims in one case it emerged that a woman had been refused legal aid to deal with an approach by an abusive partner because he had spent the previous two years in jail this was an important issue of child contact with a very violent man the report notes a recent courtroom challenge by rights of women upheld the legality of the evidence requirements for victims of domestic violence to obtain legal aid it pointed out that the ministry of justice had widened the definition of domestic violence and increased the categories of evidence since the gateway was introduced the liberal democrat chair of the committee sir alan beith mp said we welcome the mojs efforts to ensure that healthcare professionals provide victims with the necessary evidence but remain concerned that a large proportion of victims do not have any of the types of evidence required the strict requirement that evidence be from no more than two years ago should be a matter over which the legal aid agency has discretion earlier this month the shadow justice secretary sadiq khan told the guardian that of all the coalitions cuts to legal aid he was most concerned by the eligibility test for victims of domestic violence the justice select committee report said that while the moj had made significant savings in the legal aid scheme it had not discouraged unnecessary and adversarial litigation at public expense because courts and tribunals are having to meet the costs of the rise in litigants in person failed to target legal aid at those who need it most because the exceptional cases funding scheme does not work failed to prove it has delivered better overall value for money for the taxpayer because it has no idea at all of knockon costs of legal aid changes to other departments since the reforms came into effect there has been a significant underspend in the civil legal aid budget because the moj failed to ensure that those who are eligible for legal aid are able to access it beith notes jenny beck cochair of the legal aid practitioners group said victims of domestic violence cannot get the help or protection that they need it is difficult almost impossible for many people in crisis to obtain legal advice because of unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles david emmerson cochair of the family law organisation resolution said many people who have suffered domestic abuse find it very difficult to gather together the evidence required by the legal aid agency to get the support they need weve even heard of people being subjected to the horrendous experience of facing the courts without legal support only to be crossexamined directly by their abuser surely the government did not intend this situation which amounts to a perpetuation of abuse as a consequence of the legal aid cuts professor carolyn hamilton of the coram childrens legal centre said since drastic cuts to legal aid we have seen children unable to enforce the rights and protections that the law provides to them without legal support they and their families simply cannot navigate the complex legal processes they face which have lifechanging consequences andrew caplen president of the law society in england and wales also supported the select committee report there is no doubt that people are being denied access to justice recent research has shown that many domestic violence victims are being failed by the system as they face tough evidence requirements before they can even receive advice and assistance under the legal aid scheme this goes far beyond what parliament ever intended an moj spokesperson said legal aid is a vital part of our justice system thats why we made sure it will remain one of the most generous systems in the world at around bn a year after reform this government is exceptionally clear that victims of domestic violence should get legal aid wherever they need it to help break free from the abusive relationship we listened carefully to concerns and expanded the evidence that can be given to access legal aid in response since the reforms were introduced thousands of people have successfully applied for legal aid where domestic violence is involved it is entirely untrue to allege people who are eligible for legal aid under laspo have not received it we protected civil legal aid precisely so it remains available where legal help and advice is most needed we are also undertaking a comprehensive research programme to better understand why people choose to go to court and how they deal with legal problems we will look closely at the committees report and continue to keep these reforms under review,2015-03,third victim

sporting clubs are perfectly placed to change attitudes towards domestic violence and it is their responsibility to do so abc sport broadcaster and white ribbon ambassador charlie king has said king was appearing before a senate committee inquiry into domestic violence in darwin on tuesday which heard from numerous northern territory organisations about the extent of the issue in indigenous communities about of all domestic violence victims in the northern territory are indigenous women presenting at a rate of per people the rate is almost times that of nonindigenous women the inquiry heard services in the territory are overrun and underresourced with one darwin refuge having turned away families in the last six months alone more than it took in numerous witnesses from across the government police and the services sector pointed to a change in societys attitude towards domestic violence as a key measure to address it king appeared in his capacity as chair of the nt indigenous male advisory council and head of the no more campaign which targets family violence in sporting clubs the work weve been doing is about changing the attitude in particular the attitude of men towards family violence he told the hearing we dont work at the coalface we dont work with the victims he said sporting clubs had a responsibility to address the issue within their ranks and extended communities he also said the corporate world had been silent on the issue of family violence and needed to take a stronger stance they have the money to do this thats for them to do they attract the money we shouldnt have to provide it he told the hearing he said he was disappointed with cricket australias response to the death of luke batty they should have been on the front foot straight away he said they should have said hes a member of our cricket family he was killed playing cricket the no more campaign sees sporting teams take to the field linking arms to deliver a message that they dont tolerate family violence as well as taking direct action to address violence within its own ranks king wants to see the campaign expanded to all australian sporting codes and clubs with a particular focus on the youngest age groups you try and change the unders but theyve already formed an attitude about women he told guardian australia outside the hearing we want to get to the undernines you can imagine as a nineyearold if the senior players are talking to you about that saying be respectful of women theres their view being changed right there once all the domestic violence action plans for ntbased clubs are completed the clubs performances will be measured and monitored against them it locks the club in they can do whatever they want to do that works we think every sporting club in australia dont matter who you are if you bring people together to play sport part of your core business is to address the issue of family violence he called for a million australians to sign on to the campaign if we get a million ill go to canberra and meet with whoever the prime minister is and ill say prime minister thats what australians have said dont ever forget it king had earlier told the hearing the government also had to be made to take action now before momentum on the issue was lost or overtaken by another cause i think government has a role to play in this as well

almost half of single parents in the uk have been forced to borrow money from family friends or lenders to pay for childcare costs over the past two years according to a study by the charity gingerbread the group which works with oneparent families cited factors such as aboveinflation rises in childcare costs and insecure and lowpaid jobs as reasons for of respondents having borrowed to pay for childcare almost a third had missed a payment and one in seven had missed more than two more than half said they found the financial cost difficult overall gingerbread said many singleparent families were under severe financial pressure not helped by a reduction in tax credit support for childcare the charitys chief executive fiona weir said childcare just isnt affordable for many and it is very worrying that single parents are having to turn to friends and family banks and credit cards to try and cover costs the charity polled people for the study part of a wider project called paying the price which aims to detail the experiences of single parents under austerity the report notes that while the survey was selfselecting rather than random the income profile of those who responded was roughly equivalent to single parents as a whole some of the respondents were interviewed in detail about their experiences asked how they afforded childcare the answers included credit union loan go without other things beg childminder raid the savings and go without food many people said childcare affected their ability to combine work with parenthood almost a third said they would work for longer with better childcare while others described a patchwork of assistance including not just schools nurseries and childminders but afterschool and breakfast clubs babysitters grandparents and friends just over a third said they used at least three different forms of childcare during term times the report found that of single parents said childcare had not been a barrier to taking up work and said the same for study or training a glut of underemployed younger people had made finding work all the more difficult many said one parent told the study of applying for one post apparently they had applications for a hour administrative job i know damn well theyd rather employ a yearold who has an administrative background but isnt a single parent the charity notes that the cap on childcare costs that parents on lowincomes can claim back has remained unchanged since despite fastrising fees under tax credits the maximum proportion of childcare costs which can be claimed was cut in from to although under universal credit this is planned to rise to weir said the new measure was welcome but the cap meant too many single parents would see little benefit the government must honour its commitment to make work pay and swiftly bring in extra financial support he said parents cant afford to wait any longer case study nicky lloydgreame moved from hatfield in hertfordshire to wakefield in west yorkshire so that her parents could help her with childcare for her yearold daughter while she worked for a management consultancy firm unfortunately with the rising costs of childcare which werent followed with a rising wage i just couldnt afford to do it so i went selfemployed but because i didnt need childcare all the time it wasnt feasible you have to commit to certain days every week it would have basically taken all my money even with afterschool clubs they wanted the same days every week and money a term upfront id work from home as much as i could but i deliver training and coaching so i have to go to the client i moved back back here in october but for the two years before that if i needed childcare paid for my mum or my stepdad to come down and stay and i paid for them that was still cheaper in school holidays where possible id come up north and try and work from here or my parents would come down im doing a lot of the same work here and im able to take a lot more than before my stepdad is now only minutes down the road even if its a matter of picking her up from school and making sure shes got dinner im still at home of an evening im really lucky i pay for my mum and stepdads petrol and i make them dinner but its a hell of a lot cheaper,2015-03,almost half single parent uk forced borrow money family friend lender pay childcare

narcissism is a doubleedged sword it can sometimes lead to increased confidence and the tendency to be perceived as leaderlike but narcissism is also associated with negative characteristics such as a lack of empathy aggression a tendency to selfishly exploit others and trouble maintaining positive relationships over time freud asserted that women were more narcissistic than men based on his personal observation that women were more preoccupied with their physical beauty but our research shows that men tend to be slightly more narcissistic than women on average a onequarter of a standard deviation difference the magnitude of this difference is comparable to the kind observed in other personality traits such as neuroticism women are higher and risktaking men are higher because narcissism is associated with leadership emergence this raises the possibility that mens greater narcissism is one of the reasons why men are more likely than women to obtain senior leadership roles women in the united states make up of managers but only of fortune board members of corporate executive officers and only of fortune top earners if it is discovered that the narcissism gap is playing a role in this discrepancy would being more narcissistic help women to obtain these coveted leadership roles it is not clear this strategy would be effective because narcissistic behavior violates female stereotypes but not male stereotypes a woman could be sanctioned for asserting dominance entitlement or authority in the end the effectiveness of this approach would depend on the degree to which her peers adhered to and enforced gender stereotypes also it appears that the overall narcissism gender difference is being driven by particular aspects of narcissism specifically narcissism is composed of three different subdimensions exploitativeentitlement leadershipauthority and grandioseexhibitionism men tend to report higher levels of both the exploitativeentitlement and leadershipauthority subdimensions the exploitativeentitlement subdimension is measured by how respondents answer questions such as i find it easy to manipulate people whereas the leadershipauthority subdimension taps into a motivation to lead and desire to obtain positions of power and is measured by questions such as i like having authority over other people at the same time men and women did not differ in the grandioseexhibitionism subdimension of narcissism which is associated with vanity selfabsorption and a desire to be the center of attention of course not all men are exploitative and entitled and in fact our results are consistent with previous findings that show withingroup trait differences are generally larger than differences between genders in other words women and men are often more similar than different when it comes to many psychological characteristics as such it is difficult to know exactly why men on average tend to be more narcissistic than women the answer to this question was outside the scope of the current study however drawing on social role theory we speculated that the gender difference arose because of beliefs about what is considered acceptable behavior for a man versus a woman these social roles are thought to emerge in part because men and women are observed performing different behaviors for instance men more frequently hold upperlevel management positions which could create the assumption that they are more dominant than women likewise women are historically more likely to take care of children giving the impression that they are more nurturing than men owing to these stereotypes women might actually face a backlash for displaying narcissistic behaviors and choose instead to suppress their leadership abilities or competitive natures it is possible that gender stereotypes can create selffulfilling prophecies through which societys expectations produce behaviors that then confirm these expectations as social roles changed throughout the s and s women pursued different professional goals however because largescale research on narcissism did not begin until the s we were not able to detect a change in womens narcissism over the past years but in the future if gender stereotypes diminish making it more socially acceptable for women to display narcissistic behaviors we might find different results years from now and

so the reason so many women dont vote is because there are too many men in parliament the fight for womens rights goes on letters march does it not occur to these nonvoting women that if all women voted and it became known that we generally favour female candidates then party leaders would see to it that more women were available for us to vote for women who dont vote are telling our suffragette foremothers that they neednt have bothered they are saying to governments do what you like i dont care and they are acquiescing in the approach of those politicians and commentators who prefer to describe elections in abstract hypothetical or metaphorical terms bloodbath landslide race knifeedge swing redrawing the political map who will go into coalition with whom in the event of a hung parliament etc rather than use the word voter and give us due respect and coverage as active participants in the political process so get out there and vote on may sisters and brothers in the meantime let all your candidates know that you will definitely be voting you dont have to tell them who for keep them on their toes when you get to the polling booth if you dont like any of the candidates write a message to that effect voting papers with unorthodox markings are scrutinised by candidates and election officials before being dismissed as spoilt the only really spoilt ballot is the one that isnt used zoe fairbairns london as far as the tv election debates are concerned report march david cameron is not the uk prime minister but leader of one political party seeking power just like miliband and clegg number has no special authority here and its not for one party to dictate what shall happen if the parties cant agree then its no wonder the broadcasters step in to make a decision for an independent election commission will be required robin clegg swindon wiltshire,2015-03,reason many woman dont vote many men parliament fight womens right go letter march doe occur nonvoting woman woman voted became known generally favour female candidate party leader would see woman available u vote woman dont vote telling suffragette foremother neednt bothered saying government like dont care acquiescing approach politician commentator prefer describe election abstract hypothetical metaphorical term bloodbath landslide race knifeedge swing redrawing political map go coalition event hung parliament etc rather use word voter give u due respect coverage active participant political process get vote may sister brother meantime let candidate know definitely voting dont tell keep toe get polling booth dont like candidate write message effect voting paper unorthodox marking scrutinised candidate election official dismissed spoilt really spoilt ballot one isnt used zoe fairbairns london far tv election debate concerned report march david cameron uk prime minister leader one political party seeking power like miliband clegg number ha special authority one party dictate shall happen party cant agree wonder broadcaster step make decision independent election commission required robin clegg swindon wiltshire,"['reason', 'many', 'woman', 'dont', 'vote', 'many', 'men', 'parliament', 'fight', 'womens', 'right', 'go', 'letter', 'march', 'doe', 'occur', 'nonvoting', 'woman', 'woman', 'voted', 'became', 'known', 'generally', 'favour', 'female', 'candidate', 'party', 'leader', 'would', 'see', 'woman', 'available', 'u', 'vote', 'woman', 'dont', 'vote', 'telling', 'suffragette', 'foremother', 'neednt', 'bothered', 'saying', 'government', 'like', 'dont', 'care', 'acquiescing', 'approach', 'politician', 'commentator', 'prefer', 'describe', 'election', 'abstract', 'hypothetical', 'metaphorical', 'term', 'bloodbath', 'landslide', 'race', 'knifeedge', 'swing', 'redrawing', 'political', 'map', 'go', 'coalition', 'event', 'hung', 'parliament', 'etc', 'rather', 'use', 'word', 'voter', 'give', 'u', 'due', 'respect', 'coverage', 'active', 'participant', 'political', 'process', 'get', 'vote', 'may', 'sister', 'brother', 'meantime', 'let', 'candidate', 'know', 'definitely', 'voting', 'dont', 'tell', 'keep', 'toe', 'get', 'polling', 'booth', 'dont', 'like', 'candidate', 'write', 'message', 'effect', 'voting', 'paper', 'unorthodox', 'marking', 'scrutinised', 'candidate', 'election', 'official', 'dismissed', 'spoilt', 'really', 'spoilt', 'ballot', 'one', 'isnt', 'used', 'zoe', 'fairbairns', 'london', 'far', 'tv', 'election', 'debate', 'concerned', 'report', 'march', 'david', 'cameron', 'uk', 'prime', 'minister', 'leader', 'one', 'political', 'party', 'seeking', 'power', 'like', 'miliband', 'clegg', 'number', 'ha', 'special', 'authority', 'one', 'party', 'dictate', 'shall', 'happen', 'party', 'cant', 'agree', 'wonder', 'broadcaster', 'step', 'make', 'decision', 'independent', 'election', 'commission', 'required', 'robin', 'clegg', 'swindon', 'wiltshire']",102
feminism is ageist and abbott government attacks on pensioners make aged care one of the most pressing feminist issues facing australia today germaine greer has said greer was speaking as part of a panel discussion alongside us feminist commenters roxane gay and anita sarkeesian of feminist frequency and clementine ford tara moss and celeste liddle as part of the all about women festival marking international womens day at the sydney opera house on sunday feminism like the media was ageist and focused on young women of reproductive age in relationships to the exclusion of children and the elderly greer said there were heaps more pressures on women to look and act a certain way than there had been when she wrote the female eunuch and kim kardashians no help give me the right to grow up let me age she said in our society elder women have no respect she also accused the government of attacking pensioners and people who work in the aged care sector the federal government has been criticised for its proposed pension indexation measures in recent weeks greer claimed people in residential care were locked in and lost their civil rights they are incarcerated and they have committed no crime she said greer also said women working in residential care were exploited being paid per hour and without opportunities for progression the only reason you do the job is out of mercy why does the government beat up this sector because they know they can get away with it why can they get away with it because of the population has no political power almost of the direct care workforce in residential aged care are women as are of people who live in residential aged care according to aged and community services australia and the australian institute of health and welfare respectively greer said the solution was understanding how to put pressure on the system which she said men were taught from a young age and women werent if we are to stop the attacks on pensioners weve got to make it clear to tony abbott he cant get away with it during the event on sunday greer was also critical of equality between the sexes as a goal for modern feminism everyone thinks they understand equality but no one understands it its an illusory goal she said im a liberation feminist not an equality feminist equality is a profoundly conservative aim and it wont achieve anything she pointed to the gender pay gap and the slow speed with which it is reducing as evidence of the lack of parity a united nations report last week revealed that at current rates womens income would

whatever the outcome of mays general election parliament could see its biggest ever cohort of female mps led by labour which is poised to break the record set by the who came in with tony blair after the partys landslide victory in it comes as a major campaign is launched to mobilise women not only to vote but to vote feminist and to push for the issues that they care about and demand an end to the countrys entrenched gender inequality women are far less likely to vote than men and the gender gap is widening with the numbers of missing voters rising by since between and the number of women voting in general elections fell by and in the last poll in more than million women failed to vote compared with almost million men the problem was even worse among younger women with only using their ballot paper compared with of men in the same to age group last year a study by the girl guides found that only of young women had any interest in politics at all led by uk feminista and launching on international womens day the campaign aims to increase political accountability on issues affecting women by getting female voters more engaged with the process making it easy to talk to candidates who might come to their door and making it a simple online task to register to vote are two of the key measures sophie bennett codirector of uk feminista said for too long womens inequality has been treated as a side issue not the business of mainstream politics but sexism in this country is a national scandal over women are raped every year the gender pay gap stands at and women are the majority of lowpaid workers in a parliament whose membership is currently male parties will need to work hard to prove womens inequality is even on their agenda let alone a priority as part of a national registration drive the campaign will enable women to register to vote directly through the vote feminist website activist election packs which include votefeminist doorstep cards so people feel confident to ask questions of canvassers on their doorstep will be available from the campaign website helping people organise their own local hustings and to lobby their candidates directly one boost to the campaign will be the latest electoral reform society ers analysis based on current polling and the number of female candidates standing which predicts there will be women in parliament after may up from now accounting for of all mps this would move the uk from a lowly th to a less embarrassing th in the world rankings for female political representation even if ed milibands party does not win the election outright it will break its record for female representation and stretch its gender equality lead over the tories in the commons the ers figures suggest that labour partly by fielding far more female candidates in its top targets seats is likely to have female labour mps after the election up from now while the tories are on course to increase their number by to just caroline flint one of the intake who has been behind labours campaign to win female votes and boost equality said she was confident the record would be broken because her party was more associated in the public mind with issues that women cared about if you are committed to equality to social justice and concerned about the many and not the few it is understandable that our policies should reflect the concerns of women she said as a party the more women we have had involved in politics the more the language used is more in tune with the kitchen tables than the boardrooms labour now believe that the votes of women and the unders could be key david cameron has come under regular fire for having a women problem failing to promote enough female mps to top jobs and surrounding himself with a coterie of male advisers while labours frontbench has held more than double the number of women than the tories in their respective top target seats those they do not currently hold but hope to win the conservatives have female candidates selected compared with labours after the tories had female mps labour the liberal democrats seven and the snp one using current polling projections the ers predicts labour will end up with female mps the tories the snp and the lib dems one darren hughes the erss deputy chief executive said britain is well behind where it should be in terms of female representation in parliament so its heartening to see that we may take some steps in the right direction after this election but we would still be looking at fewer than one in three female mps thats no cause for celebration and we have a long way to go before our politics resembles a stcentury democracy at this rate of change fair representation of women is still a long way off uk feminista also welcomed a move towards better representation for women but believe the numbers can rise still further if women hold the parties accountable at the ballot box the campaign will also call on people to challenge their candidates to commit to tackling sexism and inequality uk feminista spends a lot of time running workshops in schools for boys girls and teachers encouraging the countrys young people to stand up against gender inequality and to recognise sexism when they see it this new move to get women engaged in politics is backed by dr helen pankhurst the greatgranddaughter of suffragette leader emmeline and granddaughter of activist sylvia i dont want to tell women what to do and say my grandmother nearly died for you to vote pankhurst said recently but i want to say you have an opportunity women didnt have in the past and still dont have elsewhere being cynical about politics and abdicating responsibility seems such a waste if only women understood the power they have emmeline pankhurst led the womens social and political union from heckling politicians going on hunger strike and committing acts of arson to fight against the governments refusal to let women vote many suffragettes were imprisoned shunned and abused bennett added its nearly years since suffragists secured the vote for women yet today women are increasingly turning away from the polling booths the next government will have a critical role to play in closing the inequality gap between women and men political parties should be vying for votes on the basis of whos got the best plan to tackle womens inequality and its up to us to hold them to account at the ballot box and vote feminist on may what the next generation thinks tasnim choudhury im put off politics because there isnt enough equality between men and women and most mps are male i care about the gender pay gap and violence against women and dont think these are being addressed a female leader would help get women to vote more all i see is men on tv shouting at each other hanane boudali young people think politicians are all liars look at prime ministers questions no young person is going to watch that its a turnoff ive only got into politics recently but womens issues arent brought up enough its all about taxes and hedge funds even when they talk about the nhs its about pensioners ifunanya onyekwelu school issues affect me but most politicians dont talk about things that matter to teenagers if i could vote now it would be for labour because ive seen the tories cut education maintenance allowance which really helped my agegroup ukip talk about sending people home and i dont like that caner aksu i became interested in feminism in my sociology class im interested in politics but i think the majority of mps are men and it should be women arent respected as much as they should be if the parties want to appeal to younger people they should be bringing up stuff teenagers care about harassment at school and online is a big issue ebru calarsoy were too young for politics we cant even focus on our exams im more interested in feminism it concerns me that its often men in the top jobs and theres still a gender pay gap i

my attitude to teaching children about money is pretty straightforward i dont as i dont consider everything in family life a teaching tool i simply give my children a bit of pocket money and let them save it or spend it as they see fit sometimes i intervene when its a stupid choice sometimes i dont sometimes i top up their pocket money sometimes i dont in other words im a fairly standard parent when it comes to money inconsistent sometimes indulgent sometimes mean driven largely by how im feeling at the time rather than any set of firm principles about teaching them the meaning of money which is why i found a book called the opposite of spoiled raising kids who are grounded generous and smart about money fascinating albeit in a rather horrified way the author the new york times money columnist ron lieber thinks children should start thinking about money early in life to develop their personality having concluded that most parents fear their children being thought of as spoilt lieber decided that it is by teaching kids about money that parents can raise children who arent i realised that every last one of those attributes ie those the opposite of spoilt from generosity to curiosity to patience and perseverance could be taught using money liebermans book is basically about two american obsessions improving your character and dollars in fact its about improving your character through dollars this leads to some suggestions that are occasionally interesting but more often bizarre so it doesnt seem odd to suggest your children have three jars for their money give save and spend this lieberman says reasonably enough gets them trained in adult spending patterns he opposes the idea that children should be paid for chores unlike of american parents who think their children should do chores for at least an hour to earn their allowance this is because children should do chores for the same reason we do because chores need to be done he also recommends that children should make their own spending decisions even if they are bad ones so far so sensible then it starts to get wacky with the three jars lieberman suggests that adults should pay interest on the save and give jars and have tax incentives for the spend jar high taxes on spend money and lower taxes on save money the parent basically stands in for the inland revenue he recommends calculating what children as young as need for the year and giving them a lump sum to cover it for skiing equipment or underwear or jeans or whatever this is in effect suggesting that a yearold could control a budget of hundreds of pounds no bailouts it gets stranger to help them make good judgments you run the hours of fun per dollar test which teaches the concept of return and investment an inexpensive fisher price cash register ranked high at hours of fun per dollar whereas a talking stuffed animal yielded only hours of fun per dollar better get rid of those economically underperforming stuffed animals lieber also recommends that highschool children work for money up to hours a week with the schoolwork burden my children already have that would leave them with about zilch hours to play with their economically underperforming stuffed animal the problem with the book is it teaches children from the word go that life is all about money even though youre dressing it up as learning about responsibility and charity in contrast i hope my haphazard attitude to finance will teach them something equally important that being too concerned about money is a kind of sickness and that while you should exercise common sense not worrying about it too much is a better attitude than thinking about it all the time timlottwriter,2015-03,attitude teaching child money pretty straightforward dont

so you think theres no need in for feminism or to campaign for equal rights for women then please take a moment to consider the following facts women account for twothirds of all working hours and produce half the worlds food but earn only of global income and own of property though women make up half the global population they represent of the worlds poor women and girls aged are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than they are war cancer malaria and traffic accidents at least one in three women around the world have been beaten coerced into sex or abused in their lifetime between million and million girls and women die each year because of genderbased violence between and million girls and women are sold into prostitution each year of maternal deaths occur in developing countries with women dying of pregnancyrelated causes at the rate of one a minute women account for nearly twothirds of the worlds million people who cannot read million girls worldwide are still denied a primary education globally only one in five parliamentarians are women this appalling list of gender inequity and injustice could go on but by now you might have read enough to be convinced that there are several compelling reasons to acknowledge and support the empowerment of women and girls imagine a world where every female can actually realise her right to live free from violence to go to school to participate in decisions and to earn equal pay for equal work for me these are the essential goals of feminism and ultimately the reason why men and boys must come on board to achieve this vision with us from a personal perspective i am keenly aware of the benefits ive received from the generations of women before me we have all inherited the freedom privileges and rights our greatgrandmothers could only have dreamed of and i am indebted to the sacrifice and dedication of the suffragette movement whose tireless work ensured that future generations of women could vote and have better lives and opportunities over the past few years there has been a definite shift in awareness concerning the infinite challenges still facing women at every level in the uk until recently womens magazines generally wouldnt touch feminism as it was deemed to be pass and uncomfortable almost needing to be whispered apologetically and avoided just a couple of months ago across british news stands the fword took pride of place in the bold headlines of four glossy magazine covers a minor victory perhaps but a definite indication of a change in attitudes while i feel encouraged by this rising interest in the usage of the word feminism i also realise that talk is cheap it can be divisive and polarising diverting us from the real issues at hand action is what is required whether it be educational societal political or personal we need to become the change we want to see by participation and action everyone can take responsibility and have a part to play when it comes to emancipation empowerment and transformation international womens day on sunday march will be a day of global solidarity with thousands of events taking place around the world to inspire and celebrate womens achievements including political rallies business conferences government activities performances debates workshops and much more the day also serves to remind us of the multitude of inequalities that still need to be addressed giving participants and contributors a special opportunity to amplify our platform and messaging marking it in london the women of the world festival

women have a responsibility to participate in the coming general election the equalities minister has said because of their predecessors who died to win the vote nicky morgan who holds the equalities brief in addition to her role as education secretary said it was hugely disappointing that the proportion of women who vote has fallen more steeply than that of men in recent decades asked how women could be persuaded to vote she said i find it incumbent on myself and i hope i am some kind of role model when i talk to girls in schools to say look women died for the vote i think its incumbent on all of us to use it research published earlier this year by the house of commons library found that while of women voted in the general election a higher proportion than that of men by the figures had fallen to of women and of men speaking to the guardian at an event for women in business before sundays international womens day morgan said politicians of all parties had failed to engage fully with women but rejected that there were particular policies that applied only to them in a coded reference to labours manifesto for women which the party will publish separately covering areas including childcare domestic violence equal pay and equal representation morgan said one of the things about engaging women in the coming election is realising there arent womens issues there are all the issues women are interested in but they may have a different perspective to men sometimes different life experiences its about the language we use and i think mps do understand that she ruled out introducing quotas on female participation in corporate boards as germany did last year where the countrys biggest companies are now required to have at least of their boardrooms made up of women im instinctively against quotas because what they dont do is drive the sort of systemic cultural change that we want to see i think if people are appointed on the basis of ticking a box that doesnt necessarily change the attitudes of everyone else around the boardroom table im certainly ruling it out im instinctively against it and ive not seen any evidence to change my mind while some progress had been made at nonexecutive level she said with no ftse boards remaining that are still allmale the next challenge is going to be the level of the executive directors and actually the layer below that because its important we have women represented all throughout organisations in her speech to the celebrating women in business conference jointly sponsored by the government and the business support organisation enterprising women morgan said that only of women felt they had the skills to start a business compared to half of men while women seek significantly lower amounts of finance to get business projects off the ground on the subject of pay she said that the stubborn gap between mens and womens pay was partly because of the roles that women chose to enter and partly about childcare part of this is wanting our women and our girls to go to jobs that pay well and also to get to senior levels in those jobs before they will take time out potentially to have families she pointed to shared parental leave which will be introduced in april allowing parents to choose how they divide leave between then having children is not a womens thing its a parents thing said morgan in her own case she said i have a situation where my husband is at home looking after our son who is seven and i am here doing this fascinating challenging crazy job we have worked that out for us and i think thats what you want for families asked when she believed men and women would be paid the same morgan said id love to say its in the next parliament i suspect we are looking at least a couple of parliaments beyond that and i think we have to work out how we speed this up morgan has recently pointed to ons figures that show the gender pay gap in the uk where men still earn more than women is at a historic low although this is in part accounted for by the fact that real wages have fallen more for men than for women during the economic downturn according to the institute of fiscal studies responding to an oecd report published on thursday that said girls lack selfconfidence in their ability at maths and science morgan said inspiring young women is key if you dont know what you are missing out on you cant apply for it and i think its not just for government its for the science establishment for teachers schools and for government as well to all work together to make sure girls dont limit their horizons before they are made aware of all the options she repeated her opposition to the compulsory introduction of sets based on ability in secondary schools a policy that david cameron last week backed saying all schools in my view should set by ability particularly in english and maths but morgan said our whole plan for education has been about trusting heads and teachers to do the right thing thats the thing behind having academies and more school autonomy the right thing is for schools to make that decision if they decide thats the right thing for that particular class or set of students im certainly not going to stop them but im going to leave it to them,2015-03,woman responsibility participate coming general election equality minister ha said predecessor died win vote nicky

commonwealth and state governments will set aside m for a public awareness campaign on domestic violence as the federal government considers working with labor to hold a national summit on the issue one woman each week in australia is murdered at the hands of a current or former intimate partner said the minister assisting the prime minister on the status of women michaelia cash thats just wrong we need as a government and as a society to shine the spotlight on the issue of domestic violence she called domestic violence a scourge on our society the governments resolve to end it is clear cash said half of the m will come from the federal government with the remainder put in by state and territory governments the social services minister scott morrison said the government has elevated domestic violence as an issue he was one of a number of labor and coalition mps who rose to speak on the issue in the chamber as a matter of public importance former western australian state prosecutor and attorney general christian porter called for a crackdown on perpetrators who ignore restraining orders saying the orders must make sure they were worth the paper they are written on another liberal mp sharman stone said the underlying issue was equality men have got to understand that women and men are equal and that they have a right to live a life that is safe stone said labor mp terri butler agreed saying there was no greater indicator of inequality than violence against women i fear that were not winning this debate this is a major concern for me the nationals mp andrew broad said pointing to the prevalence of online pornography and violent computer games as an influencer of attitudes towards women the deputy labor leader tanya plibersek has urged the coalition to support labors policy of holding a domestic violence summit taking in the voices of survivors advocates and politicians each one of them is a mother a sister an aunt plibersek said every one of them is a human being and citizen of this country and they are owed this labor has pledged to hold a national crisis summit on domestic violence within days of winning office it will not be a government talkfest we will listen to people who have endured the faults and failings of our system the cracks you can only witness by falling through them the opposition leader bill shorten said tony abbott has indicated that he will consider shortens invitation to make the summit a bipartisan initiative i am very happy to agree to sit down with the leader of the opposition to discuss what both of us what all of us can do to ensure that we get better outcomes on this issue the prime minister said during question time labor promises to spend nearly m on measures to reduce rates of domestic violence and support survivors including money for home security legal assistance and violence prevention the chief executive of mens referral service and no to violence jacqui watt said it was a pivotal time for domestic violence policy in australia with a royal commission into family violence in victoria underway the development of a national plan to reduce violence against women by the previous federal government and the recent appointment of domestic violence campaigner rosie batty as australian of the year watt said it was heartening to see governments at all levels addressing the issue but those discussions must include programs that targeted perpetrators early she said what wed like to see is both sides of government throw their weight behind programs designed to change mens behaviour and make sure they are well run and consistently measured for their impact she said we need to get men into the service system as quickly as possible so we can work with them to address their violence the ceo of domestic violence victoria fiona mccormack said while bipartisan support for tackling domestic violence was welcome there also needed to be bipartisan support for proposed measures to address it mccormack believes a national summit would be beneficial because it could invite input from people working at the coalface of domestic violence both sides of politics have raised concerns about the growing gender pay gap recent figures show that the gap has jumped to the highest it has been in years cash has announced that an undisclosed amount of money will be given to the centre for workplace leadership to work on the development of a gender equality strategy the government last month scrapped additional requirements implemented by labor on the reporting of gender indicators including the gender of job applicants and ceos pay the outcome thats been announced by the government in the last week is in my view a good outcome balancing the interests of business the interests of women the interests of all the stakeholders in this space said the outgoing head of the workplace gender equality agency helen conway what we really do want to get is effective data and get organisations to use the data so that we see action rather than just policies she told reporters during an address to the national press club conway said the reasons for the wage gap were varied and it was not solely due to employers women are concentrated in occupations and industries which are commonly very low paying she said we look to what employers control in this space they actually cant directly influence occupational segregation industrial segregation but what they can control is the gender bias in their organisations they can control the advancement of women into senior ranks where the high salaries are paid,2015-03,commonwealth state government set aside public awareness campaign domestic violence federal government considers working labor hold national summit issue one woman week australia

this is a curious election campaign for a woman on the one hand there are more female political leaders playing a more prominent role than ever before nicola sturgeon and the greens natalie bennett leanne wood for plaid cymru and the scottish tory leader ruth davidson that is a lot of women getting an unusual amount of airtime to talk about politics but women in politics is not the same as a campaign around womens issues and of what might be called a womens campaign there is almost no sign at all as the fawcett society reports women are all but invisible labours pink bus which set off last month to take politics to the voters has been to birmingham and bradford burnley bristol and brent and many many points in between its passengers mainly shadow ministers and mainly but not exclusively female have sent out messages from the frontline there are women on zerohours contracts in wales the bedroom tax hits women hardest nine million women didnt vote in theres a clue there from the moment of the autumn statement in austerity has worn a womans face tax credits the benefit that tends to be paid to women as the main carer have been slashed yvette cooper on pink bus duty on wednesday reckons that of bn of welfare cuts over the past five years bn has come directly from the household incomes that women manage according fawcett society research of the cuts have fallen on women it could be the basis for a big campaign it might have been one or two elections back but this time there is an odd disjuncture between the rise in the number of women campaigning and the decline in the significance of womens issues if you just look at the air war between the main parties this is a campaign run by men for men the relentless media focus on the leaders means it will look like that for as long as all the main parties are led by men instead the wives have been weaponised samantha cameron has been in south thanet trying to shore up the conservative vote against nigel farage miriam gonzlez durntez has been out backing the lib dems female mps but that is the way political campaigning is changing fewer and fewer big set pieces more and more onetoone encounters four million conversations this year labour claims that is partly about budgets but it is also a recognition of the distance westminster feels from most peoples lives especially womens at brentford high school for girls in west london on wednesday sixthformers got short shrift from cooper the shadow home secretary when they said they did not know enough about politics to vote before getting into a heated debate about how much people who had done well for themselves should pay in tax but that attitude is typical of the findings in the hansard societys regular audit of political engagement where women are much more likely than men to describe themselves as not very knowledgeable or very interested in politics more sophisticated polling and more thoughtful poll analysis has raised some hard questions about old assumptions for a decade thinking about female voters was built on the transformation of the historic tendency of women to vote conservative into a tendency for women to vote progressive lib dem and green as well as labour the watershed was the year history might take as the high water mark of the influence of feminism in mainstream labour politics the year when more than

women brings its own bountiful rewards subsequent elections have suggested that women tend to be on the winning side but that is not the same as saying it is women who won the election david cameron won among the women in the election that was supposed to be the mumsnet election but which turned out to be just the same as its immediate predecessors and there was panic in tory hq in when mumsnet again found that women had gone off him in much the same way as women had led the rejection of tony blair after the iraq war but early this year another mumsnet survey found the gap had narrowed from points to nine this weeks icm poll for the guardian shows there is just a onepoint difference in womens voting intentions between the two main parties but women are turning out to be very important indeed to labour their support is holding up much better than mens and after the first debate they rated ed miliband more highly than men they also rated the female leaders much more generously than men did this week theres a ninepoint deficit among mens voting intentions between the two main parties worse for labour men are much more likely to vote ukip than women a triumph for the pink bus harriet harman the partys deputy leader set off claiming that women were just not voting in greater numbers than men her mission was to get the female vote out but the statistics show it is much less

the western region of new south wales is past a state of emergency due to endemic domestic violence the states deputy opposition leader linda burney has said people are just numb theyre used to the violence and theyre used to the awfulness she told guardian australia were talking about young people teenagers all doing it theres very little understanding that domestic violence is not a normal part of your relationship because it is normal out there crime statistics show the domestic violence assault rate for the far west and orana region was three times the state average in with recorded incidents burney said regional towns faced unique challenges with domestic violence exacerbated by high levels of drug and alcohol abuse including a rural ice epidemic and a prolonged drought leading to high unemployment levels anywhere else in the country other than these tiny aboriginal towns in western nsw and there would be a national outcry with every intervention being thrown at it she said its just a tragedy i find hard to comprehend im sick of it and im willing to speak out about it for as long as it takes an yearold woman in the western nsw town of brewarrina died in an alleged domestic violence incident on saturday a yearold man was remanded in custody burney said changes by the state government to streamline homelessness services had been a monumental disaster for regional communities in nsw where there was no support and no housing for domestic violence victims under the going home staying home changes the number of tenders for homelessness services had been halved large nongovernment organisations that cater for all types of homelessness are now favoured over smaller more specialised services for funding changes to federal funding have also led to a m shortfall in nsws annual budget for homeless services burney said a longerterm view of changing the prevalence and acceptance of domestic violence was required we need to work with local football clubs and local police to develop a plan thats going to be specific to that community not a onesize fits all solution she said this is about government working together for these communities and not finding a solution outside but from within the community dixie linkgordon a community educator working with young men through rugby league clubs said family violence was widely considered acceptable in some towns with the highest reported rates including walgett moree and broken hill if you grow up in a family where violence was spoonfed to you what else would you know to serve your own family linkgordon said a state government program tackling violence trains former nrl players to speak to regional leagues about the impacts of domestic violence david peachey nathan merritt and alan tongue are among the players who have acted as ambassadors for the program in it reached about men in regional towns but linkgordon said recent funding cuts would affect its capacity rate per of domestic violencerelated assaults linkgordon said the program doesnt go in pointing fingers we have a conversation and give players the facts they are open to ask whatever they want she said in country towns its nothing to jump in a car for two hours to watch their footy team play and it was vital the conversation around domestic violence was taken to the biggest boys club in the land a footballer in nsw can relate to a footballer in queensland theres a common language there she said and it can lead to an informed conversation about the impact of family violence that wouldnt otherwise happen domestic violence is a horrific issue in nsw its a horrific issue in australia its a crisis women are getting murdered every week and in remote communities if youre battered in one town you often have to go to another town to get the support you need those distances might be hundreds of kilometres,2015-04,western region new south wale past state emergency due endemic domestic violence state deputy

violence against women is alas no new phenomenon in australia until this past year the number of our domestic dead has grown in silence amid far louder smaller public crises now survivor rosie batty is australian of the year a royal commission is proceeding into family violence in victoria and the council of australian governments coag made reducing violence against women a priority at its last meeting as for confronting the problem tony abbott has pledged we will get on with it as quickly as we can getting on with it it demands facing up to how an intersection of policy decisions fail atrisk women littlediscussed are issues like urban design the demographic challenges of new communities and the specific pressures put on services in growth areas in the city of whittlesea in the far outernorthern suburbs of melbourne the population is growing by people a week rates of family violence are also up in there were reported incidents in the local government area up from the previous year the number continues to grow and already outstrips the state average stats put it at incidents of family violence per people compared to for victoria generally young families are attracted to the area for its cheap homeandland packages there are plenty of houses but commercial developers are under no obligation to provide other infrastructure for these new communities so they dont street after street is bare with no local shops bars schools community facilities neighbourhood areas public services nor in some cases even footpaths you can get out to a civic centre like nearby epping if you have a car if you dont the closest thing the community has to public transport are a couple of private buses its a structure that jemal ahmet from whittlesea community connections the local community services agency believes isolates and endangers vulnerable women people shouldnt have to travel to get help from services when theyre at risk they should be able to walk up to them or have them a short bus ride away but these new estates and suburbs are created at a rapid rate without the support and infrastructure needed he tells me he explains that local communities will grow from a couple of thousand to in the next years but theres no plan to expand services like his the urban design of suburbs is being driven by developers he says and governments roll over by releasing land to developers while providing no support structure to the communities the workers i meet at community connections are upfront about the increasing population pressure on their services started more than years ago the agency employs a diverse staff of social workers lawyers and other caseworkers and is marketed as a generic community support service crucial says ahmet for women who out of shame stigma or plain fear would not approach a specialist family violence service disclosures of family violence are typically revealed in conversations about other legal matters like property settlements or enquiries about divorce according to ahmet between january and march alone there have been disclosures here just in february there were currently they are processing two domestic violence disclosures a day but a lack of resources prevents them from getting to people they know need help one of the resources whittlesea lacks is a local courthouse women seeking to leave violent relationships face the onerous challenge of pursuing numerous separate court orders for their protection including divorce victims compensation custody and intervention orders and identity protections for themselves and their children but a trip to the nearest court easily takes up a whole day a lawyer from whittlesea community connections can assist a woman to obtain a lifechanging legal result but that time commitment might prevent them seeing up to seven other cases the centre therefore relies on good relationships with legal aid services as well as a network of generous local lawyers and barristers who will represent women probono since access to legal aid can be very restricted the scarce resources mean the centre is left to make judgment calls on who is more at risk its incredible pressure ahmet says whittlesea community connections relies on a mosaic of funding streams from different levels and departments of government and philanthropic donors it means that despite the heavy caseload the most skilled members of the staff are often required to devote time to writing grant applications for the projectbased funding that sustains them when they could be helping clients recent proposed federal government cuts to community legal centres now reversed amidst public outcry would have resulted in redundancies or their replacement by one of the big charity empires that have ballooned from years of government outsourcing the welfare corporates have the ear of the government says ahmet but we are closer to the community and have their trust local member of parliament andrew giles is a fierce advocate for the centre and campaigned hard against the federal governments recent cuts to community legal services but even with the community legal funding restored the resources of services like whittlesea community connections are spread thin disclosures of family violence are outstripping the rate of growth in the population says ahmet plainly dealing with the practical challenge of helping abused women overcome isolation and get out of danger is the task the federal government should be getting on with senator michaelia cash may pledge government money to shine a spotlight with multimillion dollar awareness campaigns but the investment is meaningless if money isnt targeted for aware women to access effective infrastructure for help and protection when we talk about infrastructure in this country we talk about ports and roads ahmet says but we have to talk about the services that connect people into being a community and where they can get support before trouble turns into a crisis how many royal commissions do we have to have into things that shouldnt have fucked up in the first place,2015-04,violence woman ala new phenomenon australia past year number

if you accept as i do the notion that feminism is by nature antiwar then the increased presence of women in warmongering action blockbusters like man of steel which was used by the national guard as a recruitment drive and battleship should not be applauded this feminising of traditionally boysown pop culture ties into the ongoing debate about whether or not it is a feminist issue to have women on the front line on the one hand theres a school of thought that says equality is reached when female soldiers are considered as capable as their male counterparts the logical conclusion to be drawn however is that they are then just as capable of being blown to smithereens or crippled with ptsd is this true liberation or is it capitulation to the ultimate patriarchal nightmare of war it is often said that women have been written out of history since the writing of history itself is so often a concern of powerful men this is true of science art cinema and perhaps most notably upon this centenary of the first world war in the telling of the history of the great war the stories of the unprecedented number of women who volunteered and served some at the front during the first world war have traditionally taken a back seat to the tales of male bravery and derringdo that is in part due to the fact it almost neednt be mentioned that tens of millions of men died a loss of life at a level of senselessness that borders on the incomprehensible but where art is concerned and specifically the mythmaking possibilities of cinema women have been largely absent from the stories we are told about the first world war with scant exceptions the classics of the genre like gallipoli and all quiet on the western front are almost exclusively populated by men a number of filmmakers working in both cinema and television have attempted to counter this in the past year with mixed results abcs anzac girls a sixpart exploration of the true stories that befell women working with the australian army nursing service at gallipoli and the western front offered melodrama that felt ultimately soapy while its intention to tell the tales of women who have been in essence forgotten in favour of the men they worked alongside was noble in its execution zeroing in on moonlit walks with handsome soldiers even the girls of the title for all the hospital gore on show anzac girls still felt undeniably concerned with the romantic it was in this sense conservative both artistically and politically more compelling is testament of youth james kents fine big screen adaptation it previously received the telemovie treatment from bbc in of vera brittains acclaimed war memoir which opens nationally on april brittain worked as a voluntary aid detachment nurse during the war that claimed the lives of her fianc brother and two close friends she later became one of the th centurys most prominent pacifists and while love and its loss plays a role in the film testament of youth is most concerned with brittains experience of war from afar and at the front as her pacifism begins to crystallise what makes the film a compelling entry into the war movie canon from a feminist perspective is that brittain was never concerned with marriage her dream was to attend oxford university more than once during the film she is decried by the men in her life as a potential bluestocking and suffragette she admires her suitors mother a writer whose literary pursuits supports the entire family and spars with her oxford tutor miranda richardson in a small but rewarding role all this is of course waylaid by the terrible news of the antiwar stance that brittain would later champion informs testaments mournful quality even before the first battle has been fought far from the frenetic nature of joe wrights atonement this film teeters quietly on the precipice of an unknowable grief so much so that you dread the inevitable human tragedy as much as you do the paroxysms of tears you know will come to you the viewer but this is not a hankie weepie concerned solely with dashed romantic hopes the tears roll because of the witlessness of war and the waste of life when we eventually see vera played with quicksilver wit and deep empathy by the swedish actress alicia vikander standing dumfounded among a field of dead and dying soldiers the false meaning of wartime heroism and the meaninglessness of the deaths of millions that brittain campaigned against is clear there are another three years left of the centenary of the first world war and there will likely be many more films television series and plays that explore those four dreadful years the centenary and the oncoming tide of sentimentalised commemorative narratives should give us pause to consider whether the presence of womens stories about the first world war assists in righting the wrongs that a malecentric cultural history of the war have done the women who served or whether is it just another way to make the whole debacle seem hopelessly romantic rather than simply hopeless i shall never be afraid to confront the real vikanders brittain assures her fianc via voiceover as war begins

political reason but because by wearing the same outfit in public more than once kate has liberated the sisterhood from the hideous pressures of feeling they cant wear the same dress twice its very easy to point out why this is a ridiculous comparison for the sake of pedantry lets note that its physically impossible for middleton to be a suffragette shes engaging in neither an active nor militant campaign to acquire women the vote and she hasnt won one either it is ludicrous to suggest that the ongoing fight for womens equality and the oppression that women still face all over the world to varying degrees has been solved by a white upperclass woman a white upperclass woman furthermore who by virtue of being married to the second in line to the throne is the poster girl for one of the prime examples of unelected power in the uk bluntly kates function in public life whether she wants it or not is to look attractive for the fashion magazines and gawking paparazzi and to birth children for the same sycophants to fawn over she cannot be compared to the women who fought and were tortured and mocked for their right to vote there was another reason that this comparison really irritated me personally i am the greatgreatgreat niece of one of those suffragettes to whom kensit referred hilda burkitt my distant aunt was an important figure in the womens social and political union and left her job to become the birmingham branchs paid secretary but her voice has been largely silenced by history in she was jailed with several others for throwing stones at the train of the prime minister herbert asquith and three days later became the first suffragette to be illegally force fed with a nasal tube the home office was petitioned but refused to interfere with the prisons authority in she was put under surveillance for trying to set fire to a grandstand in leeds in she and her companion florence tunks burned down the bath hotel in felixstowe which was empty for refurbishment the press was horrified by the two suffragettes who threw their shoes at one of the witnesses in the courtroom he claimed to have seen them they claimed that he only talked to them to try to molest them then refused to sit still and had to be restrained by two policemen youd think that id have grown up in the shadow of such an influential foremother but i didnt know about her activities neither did my grandfather her greatnephew who would have met her a month into her twoyear sentence in she was released as part of the suffragette amnesty then in her late s she married then divorced settled in lancashire and never spoke of her suffragette past to her family again before i began to research her i couldnt help but see hilda as a vague copy of one of the few cultural depictions of a suffragette the garrulous mrs banks in mary poppins bedecked in her giant sash and annoying everybody with her raucous songs the film presents mrs banks as an antagonist her political pursuit of democratic equality means she doesnt fit into her female role and her children are thus neglected and miserable we are made to feel sorry for her equally distant and chauvinistic husband in his hightier bank job while we laugh at her trying to prove shes not a secondclass citizen however much of a caricature mrs banks is there is one repeated line in her first song that is particularly poignant our daughters daughters will adore us as they sing in grateful chorus well done sister suffragettes how sad then that suffragettes are falling through the cracks of our stillpatriarchal history and that this recent reference to them was made when talking about one of the most privileged women in the uk its even sadder that nine million women didnt use their votes in the last general election one million more than the number of women who qualified to vote under the representation of the people act in less than a century ago workingclass single women such as hilda sacrificed their independence bodily autonomy and their reputations so that they and those after them could exercise that basic democratic right there are a lot of comparisons we cannot draw between ourselves as feminists and our firstwave ancestors because women now have many more rights than they did but all over the world women are still being oppressed by their male counterparts we cannot emulate our forebears struggle but we can still remember and commemorate what they did and make use of the right they worked so very hard for us to have so it is with adoration and admiration that i shall say to myself when i drop my ballot paper into the box on may well done greatgreatgreat aunt suffragette,2015-04,patsy kensit ha month made feminist engage communal eyeroll suggesting interview stylist

i believed in feminism in my radical days of wearing a burntyellow ms magazine tshirt with no bra underneath of course to my mississippi high school i loved to debate with misogynist teenage boys and male teachers about why we needed the equal rights amendment and insisted on opening my own doors because i had to take a stand somehow in the bible belt worse i went around proclaiming that i might never get married or have babies which is sacrilege in these parts then at mississippi state in the early s i excitedly went to a local national organization of women meeting and was promptly treated like a dumb southern belle the feminists there even made a stink about of my nail polish because that was the thing to notice about a confused young feminist and daterape victim the solidarity and sisterhood id expected hoped for and needed never materialized i never went to another now meeting and even stopped calling myself a feminist for many years i remained cynical about the feminist establishment well into my thirties and am still today still i interviewed erica jong who coined the phrase zipless fuck and titillated a certain segment of uppercrust feminists in for a colorado newspaper about the divides between older and younger feminists and she took aim at esquires belittling phrase dome feminism it implies that if youre a feminist you dont like sex its total and utter bullshit jong told me then a year later after the monica lewisky scandal broke erica jong shared that her hygienist said that the intern had thirdstage gum disease as part of a discussion for the new york observer about lewinskys supposedly inferior physical attractiveness jong was possibly the kindest feminist around the table that day and jong publicly apologized to lewinsky this month telling lloyd grove of daily beast that she is now empathetic women have a tough time when they get famous for anything sexual people are cruel and im glad she survived it it was bullying it was harassment it was what lewinsky called shaming and misogyny and it is a primary reason that lewinsky doesnt call herself a feminist with a capital f even though she appreciates what feminists have done ive been insulted and cyberharassed in similar terms by some redneck bigots here in mississippi but it couldnt possibly compare with the hurt that these powerful women inflicted in their ad hominem hatefest if you arent or werent a young feminist you dont know what its like to think youve found your people only to discover that theyre just as capable of denigrating you for your gender or your sexuality as any man is there are real reasons that like lewinsky so many women still say im not a feminist but i still find it noxious that many of our feminist mouthpieces had and defended zipless fucks and then damned the next generation if they followed suit when they should have been supporting womens right to be fully themselves and to make mistakes many of us do stupid things when were young and some of them are even sexual didnt they fight for that right for us some of us trust a wellliked man who then rapes us others of us marry into domestic abuse and have difficulty escaping when he holds the purse strings still others enter into consensual sexual relationships with exactly the wrong man especially when were not yet mature enough to know that it will end very badly when it came to lewinsky too many feminists rushed to defend a man who respected women more collectively than individually and forgot that younger women were watching listening and expecting more from our founding mothers but politics trumped sisterhood and solidarity and the damagecontrol train ran over lewinskys life now that hillary clinton has officially announced that shes running for president many of those same women want other progressive women to set aside politics for solidarity and line up behind clinton now i like clinton on some days and it would be cool to have a female president but we all need to question her she has long had problems with transparency i recall her days as an inaccessible new york senator she is still too new democrat for my tastes and i admit it i dont really love the idea of letting bill clinton hang out around the oval office with too much time on his hands but some feminists dont want to hear these concerns they want a woman in the white house shes better than rand paul or ted cruz or some other rightwinger they tell us with annoyance and she probably is so were supposed to put aside our political concerns and embrace our feminist instincts for me and i suspect many others the stink that the first clinton white house left on pennsylvania aveune is still strong especially when it came to the treatment of notshort list of women will electing the hillary clinton alleviate that smell maybe but only if we decide this time around to really question any democrat that we elect to the highest office in the country even if its a democratic woman instead of simply

feminists have taken a lot away from men over the years from their exclusive access to property ownership and the right to vote to their ability to beat and sexually assault their spouses with impunity and prevent women from accessing higher education or the job market but watch out boys now were coming for your money what started as an online grassroots campaign to replace andrew jackson on the bill with a woman is now in front of congress on april senator jeanne shaheen of new hampshire introduced the women on the twenty act which would create a panel of citizens to choose a woman to grace the front of a newandimproved bill and yes its a much bigger deal than the susan b anthony or sacagawea dollar coins everybody uses twenties and no one wants to carry around more change senator shaheen told lawrence odonnell that night we need to recognize the contributions of some of the women in american history and in a statement she said our paper currency is an important part of our everyday lives and reflects our values traditions and history as americans its such a lovely simple idea but because it involves touting womens accomplishments im quite sure it will be painted as some sort of feminazi treasury takeover weve seen it happen before when uk activist caroline criadoperez successfully campaigned to get jane austen on the note in she was met with rape and death threats thankfully a few of her abusers had their day in court any time something like this happens rank misogyny in the face of a completely reasonable idea i try to make sense of it but the only thing i come away with is something my fouryear old daughter said to me a few days ago some people dont like girls and because some people dont like girls i predict this move in the us will provoke a similar outcry but like the campaign in the uk i also believe that the us campaign will ultimately be successful its high time we honored womens accomplishments on currency and there are plenty of women to choose from women on s the campaign that started it all began with candidates and then asked people to vote for their favorite ones until only the top four remained eleanor roosevelt harriet tubman rosa parks and wilma mankiller all worthy women though i imagine that if senator shaheens bill is successful well start this selection process all over again naturally i have my own suggestion for what woman should be on the bill its true that our currency honors those who have contributed to american history but this is also an opportunity to remind americans about our future not just what kind of country we were but what kind of country wed like to be thats why my vote would go to ida b wells who also made the list of yearold sofia the girl who wrote to president obama asking why there were no women on american currency wells wasnt just an africanamerican civil rights leader member of the womens suffrage movement and newspaper editor she also shone a light on the horror of lynching documenting the crimes carefully and contextualizing the way they were used as a means of both social and economic control over the black community putting wells on the bill would not only mean one less man in my wallet it would also mean confronting every time we pay or receive payment the face of a woman who first explained to america how we use violence as a means of economic control of people of color and that as the men sometimes say is so money,2015-04,feminist taken lot away men year exclusive access property ownership right vote ability beat sexually assault spouse impunity

why did nine million women fail to vote at the last election labour quotes figures that suggest nearly a million fewer women than men voted although others think the gap might be smaller taking account of demographics but since women had to struggle so hard to get the vote shouldnt they be first in the queue at the polling booths on monday its the deadline for everyone to register to vote and its worth remembering what women were doing a hundred years ago to secure the right to a vote they chained themselves to railings blew up buildings and letter boxes and more than a thousand went to jail in prison they went on hunger strikes demanding to be treated as political prisoners and were brutally forcefed a tough womens body guard had to be formed around the pankhursts leaders of the suffrage movement to protect them from attack wherever they went worse was the scorn they endured as objects of ridicule seen as unmarriageable contemptible hideous unwomen i wont use the word suffragette as it was coined in mockery by the daily mail they called themselves suffragists and they suffered for it personally and socially enduring much worse than current womenhating twitter storms at least now women under attack get waves of support they didnt back then when other women often turned against them afraid of social contamination women as a whole were not progressive as their later voting habits showed when old battles are long won they become cosy and safe shorn of risk or ferocity consider walt disneys sanitised mrs banks in her sash in mary poppins singing our daughters daughters will adore us and theyll sing in grateful chorus well done sister suffragette or the chirpiness of made in dagenham the story of women fighting for equal pay who took great risks not least against some unions but now its a happyending musical drained of danger cheered to the rafters though trade unions are routinely reviled history has a way of turning hardwon uncertain struggles into genteel heritage but telling women to vote because their greatgrandmothers fought for their rights is as forlorn as telling children to eat their crusts because of hungry children in the sahara the prime minister herbert asquith opposed votes for women not just because they smashed his downing street windows and attacked his carriage but because he feared women would swing the vote away from the liberals towards the tories he was right the hard truth is that women getting the vote created a natural conservative hegemony for decades women stayed apparently unmoved by labour introducing the nhs baby clinics child benefit abortion contraception rights and much more margaret thatcher owed her victory to women backed her while only of women voted labour among men only more voted for thatcher than for labour not until did women for the first time lean leftwards and they have done ever since now labour has a fourpoint lead over the conservatives among women according to average yougov polls while labour lags two points behind the tories among men to that calm down dear was emblematic alongside david camerons failure to promote many women lurching rightwards cameron failed to notice that it was his lack of womens votes that denied him a majority in since then his policies have tilted sharply against women of his cuts came from womens pockets women were the heaviest losers from the million lost public sector jobs good jobs replaced with lowwage agency work women suffered most in cuts to services for the old and children and were hardest hit by benefit cuts and freezes ruthless benefit sanctions have hit women worst as they try to juggle children and jobseeking rules and are cut off when they refuse shift work recently the pay gap has widened for the first time in years with women earning an average less than men fawcett society figures show more than twothirds of top earners are men and that female managers are earning less than men twothirds of women earn below the living wage and for every a man earns a women gets just p the parties might take note from the electoral reform societys chief executive katie ghose who says women are more likely to make up their minds later then men giving the parties extra incentive to reach out to women right up until close of polls a last minute battle for their votes would be a fine thing put the party manifestos through a womens lens and because more women are lowpaid and because more women depend on public services its easy to see why they lean towards labour the surprise is that the gap isnt wider one polling expert suggests the demographic reason why many more younger women do vote labour but there are more older women and as cameron is well aware the old vote more conservative as the next generation of women reaches retirement they may keep their leftleaning voting habits,2015-04,nine million woman fail vote last election labour quote figure suggest nearly million fewer woman

when i visit college campuses young women always ask me how i deal with negativity online and how they can how can i write and participate on social media when it inevitably results in ad hominem attacks and vitriol the students i speak to increasingly feel like they have to consider before choosing a career path or posting an opinion in a public forum whether they can cope with violently sexist responses and a neverending barrage of misogynistic bullshit if anyone knows the answer to their questions its hillary clinton her career has long epitomized how misogyny can haunts female politicians the hillary nutcracker the pokes about her headbands her hair her pantsuits her voice she has too often been the target of insults based on mens fear about powerful women an unenviable position that few can understand at least we couldnt understand it in but thanks to the explosion of social media everyone is a public figure at least in a micro sense we all have friends followers fans and driveby haters and a new generation of young female voters who have grown up being targets of digital abuse may empathize with the sexism that was and will be directed at clinton after all young women hear similar kinds of invective day after day albeit on a much different scale whereas a man yelled iron my shirt at clinton during a new hampshire speech in her last campaign young women posting on tumblr get told to make me a sammich as clintons age and looks are dissected in the national media a female college student somewhere will be told that shes a hideous slut on yikyak according to research from pew of young internet users have been harassed online young women in particular were more likely to experience harassment on social media of young women polled said they had been stalked online and were sexually harassed online a study from the university of maryland showed that internet users with femalesounding usernames were times more likely to receive sexually explicit and threatening messages and thats not even taking into account revenge porn or gamergate the online harassment of women is not likely to end anytime soon neither is the sexism that targets clinton jamia wilson the executive director of women action amp media told me that while the misogyny aimed at clinton may be less explicit than in that undue focus on her husband her looks her attire her personal life and her age will persist so instead of ignoring the trolls as we are all so oft told to do it could be beneficial to clintons campaign for her to speak directly about the sexism she faces and how she deals with it every day after all one of the defining moments of clintons last presidential run was when someone asked her how she keeps upbeat in the face of it all and in an authentic moment of frustration and sadness she welled up a bit while giving her answer clearly there is more to winning over young female voters than commiserating over sexist awfulness and advice on overcoming misogyny but im betting theres a deepseated desire in a lot of young women to see sexist tormentors get theirs maybe they cant stop the guy who tweets fat jokes at them and maybe theyre too embarrassed to report the anonymous sexual threats in their facebook messages but what they can do is give a big fuck you to every getbackinthekitchen youtube bottomdweller or cable news host jerk who mocks clintons appearance by making their distaste known at the voting booth then well see who is making the sammiches ill take an italian sub,2015-04,visit college campus young woman always ask deal

women in tech have been told to lean in back off be bigger blowhards and simultaneously let others shine but by far the most inspiring and probably the most effective piece of advice is the one found on the otherwise rather mysterious new website tableflipclub fuck that were done its not us its you meaningful change the anonymous woman behind the site told me over email requires not just tweaking but reinvention from the top down its virtually impossible to change a sick system without being the one in charge you cant destroy the masters house it seems when the masters a tool her site went up on monday and hosts a single word piece of writing giving voice to years or decades of exasperation when we try to play by the rules which we do because weve seen what happens to women who dont were denied opportunities because we arent ready for them and we are also denied the things you say we need in order to be ready when we do these things without your corporate approval we do it knowing that we may be the next woman who gets quietly fired for being too forward when we try to take a seat at the table like sheryl said we should were called presumptuous the solution its time we take our potential elsewhere what makes her campaign so novel is that it applies the language and techniques of political activism to something thats been treated as a business problem many selfhelp books and workshops designed to support women at work actually place the onus of responsibility on them encouraging women to brag more but promise less to be more assertive and less aggressive but the tableflipclub founder rejects the idea that women should try to adapt to the demands of an alreadybroken system in order to survive flipping the tables takes the just try harder just sit at the table advice and flips it on its head were already trying so goddamn hard and its not working women are leaving in droves so we need to change something opting out is straight out of the universe of boycotts and strikes it acknowledges that the problems faced by women in tech are inherently political and cant be solved by a human resources department the difficulties women face arent the problems of one woman or one team or one company theyre not just limited to adria richards or brianna wu or ellen pao theyre not just twitter with its nowomen board or wikipedia with its male editors the problems are systemic and no amount of attitude adjustment or leaning in on the part of those who get screwed by the system can possible change it so many women are in shitty abusive toxic work environments and internalize the badness as being something wrong with them the woman behind tableflipclub told me making it clear that its systemic is a small but vital step towards making those environments obsolete even as an outside observer i found the tableflipclub manifesto energizing it has the feeling of a furious tweetstorm or impassioned speech it goes beyond a mission statement and into the realm of oratory its a huge departure from the usual womenintech rhetoric which usually focuses on prying the doors of the tech world open through education a positive attitude and changing the work environment nobody ever advocates just slamming the door back in silicon valleys face tableflipclubs intention isnt simply to punish the establishment by depriving it of womens contributions although certainly that will happen in the short term a couple of people have already quit their jobs after reading the manifesto its author told me which is super rad its not about revenge any more than boycotts are about driving companies bankrupt its about allowing for meaningful change by refusing to participate in a corrupt system once we acknowledge that the system is well and truly broken once we recognize this as a problem for activists not business analysts women can start to realize that we dont have to struggle to fit ourselves into the cracks that are left for us and once were empowered to leave we can make something new this piece was updated on april to include the authors original last paragraph,2015-04,woman tech told lean back bigger blowhard simultaneously let others

at some point in every election campaign it is announced that the womens vote is critical we havent quite got there yet this time even if we came close to it two months ago when the magenta bus drove off on labours biggest womens campaign ever at the last general election million women didnt vote and thats because they just dont think that politicians have any interest in their lives said the partys deputy leader harriet harman as she climbed aboard and headed out of london the assumption that its only female voters who have gone off politicians is open to question as the tory pollster lord ashcroft observed of his own party the conservatives dont attract too few women they attract too few of everyone but there is real evidence that women think about themselves and their relationship with politics in a different way to men the hansard societys regular audit of political engagement finds women even more despairing of the system of governing less likely to have engaged in activism and much less likely to think they know anything about politics than men you have to wonder if this isnt a reflection of the way male politicians think about women only five years ago the signs had been so promising david cameron had his party in an armlock women were being selected as tory candidates in unprecedented numbers although not so much in winnable seats the partys policies suggested a new awareness of the reality of womens lives there were pledges about maternity leave and paid paternity leave and more and cheaper childcare finally the realisation that women make up of the electorate appeared to have trickled through yet it soon became clear that was not so much a new dawn as a highwater mark the years of labour dominance had established the idea of diversity as a benchmark of a modern approach to politics tories embraced it as a way of looking metropolitan and contemporary it was more a bit of positioning than a way of framing policymaking cameron didnt put it high enough on the agenda to fight his party over it in fact he slid with easy familiarity into the kind of sexist putdown that he deployed when he told angela eagle to calm down dear faced with a collapse in support among women the tory rhetoric transformed there is a huge opportunity this year for britain to absolutely lead the charge on womens equality cameron said early in on womens empowerment on the empowerment of girls and women worldwide to demonstrate his earnest purpose he appointed more women to his cabinet who were promptly ranked by the daily mail on their fashion sense anyone just dipping in to british politics for the election campaign the way most people do might think things were getting better in the sevenway leaders debate there was parity in the studio thanks to having julie etchingham as presenter at this weeks challengers debate women will be in a majority yet the process of actually making politics equal has stalled the visibility of women is disguising how little underneath is different the rate of increase in the number of female mps has crashed since the women elected for labour in of the tory women elected in four have already decided to stand down only a third of the candidates in winnable conservative seats at this election are women and although more than half the candidates labour has selected are women in winnable seats the rate plummets to so heres a prediction any day now the socalled womens campaign will be launched there will be a flurry of concern about how women are likely to vote there will be detailed analysis of the way women tend to prioritise the nhs and public services over tax cuts and relations with europe some may observe that women tend to decide later so theirs is the vote to be fought for in the closing days of the campaign this will be followed by several days of coverage of the leaders wives with the occasional walkon part for their exgirlfriends womens sport shows us what actual change can look like last saturday for the first time oxford and cambridge womens crews rowed the same course on the same day as the mens crews it happened largely thanks to a woman called helena morrissey who said her company newton asset management would only sponsor the boat race on the condition that the womens crews rowed on the same day as the mens over the same course and on tv the authorities gulped but they needed the money so they agreed the nations favourite presenter clare balding abandoned the grand national to be there any fight needs symbolic triumphs and whatever you think of the boat race it is pretty near the top of any league table of male bastions to realise the impact of saturdays event on the sport bear in mind that because of the exposure it has brought the oxford womens crew has for the first time been able to buy a minibus to get to training rather than use public transport maybe this can teach politics something perhaps the answer is someone to offer the first party with equal numbers of male and female candidates in winnable seats a big fat cheque wheres british politics own helena morrissey,2015-04,point every election campaign announced womens vote critical havent

david camerons promise of hours of free childcare a week to working parents of threetofouryearolds doubles the current offer of hours but questions are already being raised about the feasibility of the policy childcare campaigners say the existing offer is already underfunded by the government with parents and providers making up the shortfall doubling it to they warn risks undermining the sustainability of the sector under current childcare arrangements there is a universal offer of hours to all parents of three and fouryearolds and of the most deprived twoyearolds the tories election pledge doubles it trumping labours offer of hours but the enhanced offer is more narrowly defined to families where all parents are working thereby missing deprived children who might need it most conservatives say that is equivalent to a year per child which would cost approximately m a figure the party claims will be funded by curbing pension relief for the highest earners neil leitch the chief executive of the preschool learning alliance raised concerns about the financial viability of the offer and how it will be delivered he said although in theory any steps taken to improve the availability of childcare are positive we would seriously question how feasible this pledge is in practice at the moment government funding does not cover the cost of delivering hours of childcare for three and fouryear olds and so it has been left to providers and parents to make up the shortfall it is difficult to see therefore how plans to double the current offer without addressing this historic underfunding can be implemented without leading to even higher childcare costs or risking the sustainability of the sector altogether childcare costs are a significant concern for parents who may see this offer as a votewinner yet early years experts caution that childcare is about more than simply enabling parents to return to work and say any election offers should focus on the quality of early education and care leitch said the first five years of a childs life are crucial to their longterm development as such it is vital that whoever is in government after may is willing and able to provide the investment that providers need to be able to deliver affordable sustainable and crucially highquality early education and care while welcoming extra support for parents with childcare costs the family and childcare trust warned that the current complex system was broken and in need of a full independent review its chief executive stephen dunmore said parents in the uk pay more for childcare than anywhere else in europe the cost of a parttime nursery place for a child under two has increased by over the course of this parliament and now costs an average of a year but despite these high childcare prices many providers find it difficult to break even the proposed extra support for parents with childcare costs is welcome and it is reassuring to see politicians from all political parties acknowledge that improvements to our childcare system are urgently needed however these proposals alone wont fix our broken system it is essential that all political parties to commit to a full independent review of the childcare system in the uk dunmore added in the short term it is also imperative that any incoming government take action to address the current situation they must look to merge universal credit support for childcare with the taxfree childcare scheme to create a single and fair system increase the support available for one and twoyearolds and overhaul the funding formula for three and fouryearolds to take account of poverty and other social factors,2015-04,david camerons promise hour free childcare week working parent threetofouryearolds double

until i saw reports about winston churchill being introduced as the new face of the five pound note id never given bank notes much thought but on reading that hed be replacing the prison reformer elizabeth fry i realised this meant that other than the queen there wouldnt be any women on sterling at all it was only a few months since id set up the womens room which explores female representation and i was acutely aware of how often women have been excised from our history in the past i didnt think there was any machiavellian intent in the bank of englands decision but the oversight made me angry and i wanted to make a stand i started tweeting about it and set up a petition on changeorg then the media picked up on the story and i started getting requests to do press and tv interviews a lawyer contacted me saying she thought the banks decision breached the public sector equality duty and put me in touch with a solicitor louise whitfield who helped me draft a letter of complaint the bank was surprisingly quick to respond but its letter was very dismissive it said women had been considered in the selection process and seemed to imply that was enough preinternet that might have been it i can imagine a situation where id have been very disheartened by that response and not known what to do next instead i was able to post a screenshot of the letter and publicly mock it this added fuel to my campaign as the letter was reposted across the internet the number of petition signatories rocketed and we presented over signatures to the bank we made a request on twitter for people to attend the presentation dressed as historical female figures i remember being really nervous because it could just have ended up being me dressed as rosalind franklin with my dog but i neednt have worried the response was phenomenal we had mary sewell emmeline pankhurst amy johnson george eliot boudica an amazing turnout the bank seemed reluctant to back down and maintained there were no grounds for a legal challenge nevertheless i set up a crowdfunding page to raise money to potentially take them to court and the response was incredible within two weeks wed raised up to then i had a request from the bank for a meeting i think this coincided with mark carney taking over from mervyn king as governor its possible he came in on his first day and said i dont want to be worrying about the bloody faces on bank notes get all this off my desk i maintained a poker face when i was called back in and told jane austen would be the new face of the note but i was overjoyed there will still be a few months after churchill is introduced when the notes will be allmale but now the process has been reviewed id like to see more women joining austen the crimean wartime nurse mary seacole perhaps or mary wollstonecraft the bank obviously made the right decision but without the power of the internet who knows what would have happened early on id felt like just one person

i came to politics quite late in life my damascene moment was a man farting in the womens studies section of waterstones around three years ago to many people this wouldve just been unpleasant but it ended up being my political awakening a chemical composition of nitrogen hydrogen carbon dioxide oxygen and methane introduced me to simone de beauvoir this mans fart emitted in a public space and in a womens studies section no less displayed a total lack of empathy for any feminists that might be lurking there if even womens studies sections in bookshops were under attack then what hope did actual women have i wasnt politically engaged growing up but became more so as a teenager i was the youngest of nine kids and we were all very opinionated i supported greenpeace and i was vegetarian not because i thought eating animals was cruel and disgusting but because i didnt like the idea of meat later i thought ill just say its cruel as well my mum who died in was in the unions and supported the welsh miners she was a spokesperson for the national union of public employees and was really active in the community how she found time for doing all of this as well as bringing up nine children and keeping down a job is beyond me my parents were lifelong irish catholics and labour party supporters and tory haters but they didnt talk about politics with us kids so politics and feminism werent things i grew up with the only march i ever went on was for the motorcycle action group during my biker period which ran from i cant even remember what it said on my placard probably something like hey car drivers stop running us down cheers i started talking about feminism in my standup routines in at first i thought it might be alienating so i did it from the perspective of an ant instead talking about how difficult it was being an ant comedian then gradually over the next four years i gained enough confidence to talk about feminism from the perspective of a human woman i met leyla hussein an fgm survivor and antifgm activist and we hit it off straight away she taught me that no subject should be off limits you just need to be clear who or what the target is i worried that i didnt have a right to talk about fgm as i dont come from an fgmpractising community but leyla believes you can talk about whatever you like regardless of whether youve been directly affected her wisdom freed me up and i wrote two bbc radio series about feminism bridget christie minds the gap and my edinburgh shows a bic for her and an ungrateful woman having said that youre not going to please all of the people all of the time we are all fallible but for me failure is not trying and slightly misjudging something its not trying at all when i feel that im not doing things properly or that im not doing enough or that someone else is doing something better i remind myself of a quote from a female olympic cyclist who said when im racing i dont look at whos behind me or in front of me or coming up beside me and if i dont win the race but i beat my own time ive won its important not to beat yourself up about what youre not doing i used to bin lads mags which were inappropriately displayed at toddler height whenever i went shopping because thats all i had time to do obviously its a good thing most human rights activists and campaigners dont have my attitude otherwise nothing would get done but you dont have to lead marches or front campaigns or dedicate your entire life to a cause your activism whatever form it takes is the right activism for you modern technology means that these days we dont have to get dressed or knock up a placard or chain ourselves to railings to make a difference epetitions have turned us all into armchair activists and theres nothing wrong with that were all doing our own little bit and if we all do a little bit then together its a big bit bridget christies show an ungrateful woman returns to the soho theatre may pm sohotheatrecom how i did it leyla hussein on her year campaign to put fgm in the spotlight ive been campaigning in support of girls who have undergone fgm or are at risk of it for more than a decade and widespread recognition of the phrase female genital mutilation is one of the greatest advances we have made weve had to use tactics such as the vagina tent we put up on the south bank to coax people into engaging passersby were intrigued by the pink tent and the vulvashaped cupcakes we handed out had they known that once inside they would be given a lecture on fgm i doubt many would have stopped we are campaigning about a form of child abuse pure and simple one fgm survivor i spoke to referred to what shed undergone as butchery were talking about clitorises being removed labia being cut away or stitched together often by unqualified practitioners some people assume fgm is a religious practice which stops them criticising it for fear of causing offence but it isnt its simply a brutal custom used to control female sexuality a petition last year attracted well over signatures which led to a parliamentary debate and ultimately amendments to the serious crime bill aimed at identifying and preventing fgm theres a long way to go but steps like these are encouraging the cycle has been broken in my family i made sure my daughter didnt undergo fgm making her the first girl in our family to be free of it i believe we can inspire others to have the courage to do the same interview by chris broughton,2015-04,came politics quite late life damascene moment wa man farting womens study section

business leaders have branded them a nightmare politicians say theyll create a cultural shift in the workplace what exactly are the new rules on shared parental leave and are we really about to see a generation of dads wearing slings instead of suits until last week the uk had the most unequal parental leave arrangements in the western world with new mothers entitled to up to a year off work while employed fathers got just two weeks statutory paternity leave in a handful of dads were given more time with their babies but only once the new arrival was over five months old and only if mum went back to work this all changed on easter sunday as additional paternity leave made way for shared parental leave now after two weeks of compulsory maternity leave new parents have weeks to split between them in any way they wish the key changes are fathers or mothers partners can take up to weeks of leave useful for families in which mum is the higher earner couples can take all or part of the leave simultaneously each parent may take up to three separate blocks of leave so either one could return to work for a particular project or to help with a seasonal increase in workload both parents need to be working but only one has to be an employee by the th week before their baby is due one parent must have been continuously employed for six months the other could be in a new job or selfemployed as long as they meet the employment and earnings test basically working full or parttime for at least of the weeks before the due date each parent on spl may work up to shared parental leave in touch split days these are optional and paid at the employees usual rate the new rules apply to couples who are adopting in a samesex partnership or bringing up a baby from a previous relationship as well as to birth parents the right to six weeks leave at of full earnings remains exclusively for birth mothers and primary adopters so its unlikely many mums will be handing their newborn to dad and dashing back to their desk after a fortnight deputy prime minister nick clegg is confident the new legislation will sweep away those edwardian rules which hold back families working hard to juggle their responsibilities at home and work but for some spl doesnt go far enough its a step in the right direction but its far from perfect says jeremy davies head of communications at the fatherhood institute although its called shared parental leave its really transferable maternity leave it doesnt give fathers any independent right or responsibility for taking time off and it doesnt fundamentally challenge employers attitudes for others the new regulations go too far the institute of directors has said they will heap yet more burdens on struggling employers there is no legal requirement for firms to match their shared parental leave benefits to any enhanced maternity benefits they offer but several large employers including citigroup pwc shell and the civil service are offering enhanced spl on the same terms as their maternity leave packages it isnt actually that complicated says stewart gee head of guidance at acas both employers arent required to talk to each other one employer doesnt pay both sets of parents each parent is simply dealing with their own employer stewarts advice to couples considering spl is to apply early you dont have to do anything until eight weeks before you want to start taking the leave but leaving it until the last minute is going to make life more complicated for everyone involved there remains many unanswered questions will it put pressure on high earning women to return to work sooner than theyd like could it make it less acceptable for new mothers to be away from the workplace for a year might it undermine breastfeeding rates but the biggest question for most families is can we afford it unless one or both parents works for a company offering enhanced spl pay theyll receive just a week or less for lower earners little more than half of the national minimum wage for a fulltime worker and weeks of the maximum that a couple can take are unpaid in recent research by working families and bright horizons more than half of dads said they would be interested in taking spl yet currently only manage to take even their two weeks of statutory paternity leave with the figure just in the lowest income households the government expects just of the eligible couples to apply for spl in the first year acas has produced a comprehensive guide to spl at acasorgukspl making the decision darren parker and his wife lynne are expecting their first baby in july the couple live in east kilbride but darren works in london as an assistant vice president for citigroup the companys generous spl scheme means hell have weeks off work on full pay from october to spend with his family lynne will also be on leave from her job as an environmental health officer he says i wasnt aware of shared parental leave until i saw the screens in the citi lobby advertising the changes once wed had our week scan i emailed hr to find out more my decision has taken some people by surprise most regard me as quite careerfocused but this is a onceinalifetime opportunity and i think if i didnt take the leave i would regret it citis spl policy and the protection it gives means it shouldnt have any negative impact on my career in the long term like most new dads kevin cremonahoward will be eligible to take statutory spl when his first baby arrives in may kevin an it consultant for the nav people plans to take over the baby care for two and a half months from november when wife liz returns to her job in publishing we decided to share the leave as we both wanted to be involved in the first year of our babys life it feels like the right thing to do rather than leaving it all to liz im sure its not going to be easy but im really looking forward to it as this is our first child neither of us knows quite what to expect but at six months old i think the baby will be at a fun age we expect to dip into savings to cover the period when my salary is replaced by shared parental pay were taking just nine months leave between us

can you take a joke the question isnt sexist or discriminatory in itself but put it into the context of a job interview where the employer male has just told you a woman that the company is very male dominated and banter is common whats the implication now can you make me a cup of tea not inherently sexist but what if the question is addressed to a colleague who has just walked into a meeting whose job description doesnt include making refreshments and who just happens to be the only woman in the room what if this kind of situation is repeated over and over again for many women working life is littered with questions and comments sometimes so subtle that they feel meaningless sometimes loaded with clear intent which have an insidious cumulative impact from the offhand description of your allfemale team as girls to the colleague who assumes your male pa is your superior from the appraisal that casually mentions appearance to the senior colleague who shakes hands with every man in the room but coincidentally seems to miss out the two women the meeting where a woman puts forward an idea to a muted response only to have it repeated five minutes later by a male colleague to noisy approval how on earth do you substantiate at some future moment that any one such incident happened at all and should your career not progress as quickly as those of your male colleagues how can you prove whether the two things are related the answer if ellen paos experience is anything to go by is that you cant last month pao lost a sexual discrimination case against her former employer venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield amp byers the trial included descriptions of a boys club atmosphere including allmale trips and inappropriate advances from senior male partners to junior female colleagues or as pao herself has since described gender bias in silicon valley death by a thousand cuts in the eyes of the court there wasnt a substantial enough link between such incidents and the decisions made about paos career to prove discrimination but the outpouring of responses from other women around the world just take a look at the thankyouellenpao hashtag has made it clear that this is something many strongly identify with reacting to the results of the trial some commentators have triumphantly trotted out the old line that women should suck it up and get tougher about coping with sexism others have used paos defeat to suggestthat because of her audacity tech companies might become even less likely to hire women fearing similar lawsuits though given the dire current stats on women in tech i dont think many of us would point to paos single dissenting voice as the major problem there to me the outcome suggests something else that we are looking at this all wrong what paos case shows is just how difficult it is for the victim to solve the problem of lowlevel sexism in the workplace even if she had won the highprofile nature of the case would still have saddled her with a permanent legacy likely to hamper her future career before you even reach the problem of bad press many women dont make it to court in the first place here in the uk sex discrimination claims have plummeted by since the introduction of up to tribunal fees in and what about women who dont work at major companies with hr departments but suffer sexist jibes or unwanted groping while working behind a bar or waiting tables fear of being labelled a troublemaker at best or losing ones job at worst is enough to prevent the vast majority of those experiencing sexual harassment or discrimination in the workplace from ever speaking out when the equal opportunities commission found that women lose their jobs every year as a result of maternity discrimination the results also revealed that fewer than ever went to a tribunal to seek financial compensation so while we should encourage women to come forward it is deeply unrealistic to expect victims to be the ones to fix the problem but the incentive is there for employers to step up instead we know it makes business sense for bosses to want the very best of the talent pool to pick from not just the best of the white male talent pool we know that companies with more diverse workforces perform better and those with more women on boards report higher returns its just common sense to assume that employees who arent suffering the stress of harassment or discrimination are likely to perform better companies can tackle workplace gender inequality with a raft of measures as pao herself has shown knowing that women can be penalised for negotiating when pao took over at social media company reddit she levelled the playing field by removing that aspect of the hiring process other women in tech have also shown how easy it is to make practical impactful changes palo alto software ceo sabrina parsons flexible childcare options for new parents are a prime example greater transparency about pay levels clear

the former governor general dame quentin bryce has said everyone must challenge the unequal distribution of power and resources between men and women in order to address domestic violence which she described as an appalling scourge in our society in march bryce released a report from a taskforce she chaired aimed at reducing domestic violence in queensland it described the issue as the most grave human rights issue in the world and made recommendations for preventing and addressing it on monday she told the abcs am radio program there were family violence cases reported every day in queensland police tell me that they see that as the tip of the iceberg the figures are so grave and the very deep concern for all of us is the fact that after a generation of providing services since we started talking about domestic violence to bring it out from under the carpet about years ago in our country its getting worse and its increasing in gravity and incidence bryce told the abc its appalling one can hardly think of words that capture how horrific this breach of human rights around our world is in every nation and certainly around our country the truth is that domestic and family violence is caused by unequal distribution of power and resources between men and women its about the rigid gender roles and stereotypes that characterise our society and the culture and the attitudes that support violence against women on average at least one woman is killed as a result of domestic violence in australia every week and it is the biggest contributor to preventable illhealth and premature death in women under according to vichealth bryce emphasised the need for a wholecommunity approach to preventing domestic violence its not just an issue for government though governments must take leadership must take action must provide services and funding bryce said but for all of us we must be asking ourselves now about our culture about our attitudes and what can we do as neighbours and family and friends what can each one of us do about this appalling scourge in our society its about all of us speaking up so that we arent bystanders so that we dont condone or ignore behaviour this article was amended on april to correct the reported rate at which women are killed by intimate partners women die this way in australia at the rate of slightly more than one a week

what is westminsters problem with women or more accurately what is womens problem with westminster almost years after women won the vote a vast and it seems growing number are undecided about which party to support a third according to recent polls against a quarter of men in of women voted conservative labour and lib dem but million women a million more than men declined to vote only half of the uks women with children exercised their democratic right while democracy is flourishing in much of the rest of the world see nigeria in england and wales it is shrinking fast with no sign of the revival that scotland saw in the referendum on thursday in the televised leaders debate some declared the snps nicola sturgeon the winner what stood out was that she along with natalie bennett of the greens and leanne wood of plaid cymru defended the public realm the social infrastructure that includes health and care far more effectively than the four male leaders women are not a homogenous mass of course but what affects them all as long as they remain willingly or otherwise the chief cooks and bottlewashers in the domestic domain is what is publicly shared and protected rather than privately owned while the three main party leaders are regularly portrayed in hard hats and highvis jackets surrounded by men and machinery female disengagement keeps on growing not least because the sharply serrated edge of the cuts has hit more of them harder than men proof of westminsters myopic male view before greater numbers of women supported the conservative party and class influenced voting habits then tony blair was elected leader of the labour party and he was liked worcester woman the working class woman with children and allegedly little interest in politics came to the fore and the vote hunters gave chase women mattered and they gave new labour their vote subsequently thanks to prodding by female activists trade unionists and labour politicians such as harriet harman now deputy leader aspects of womens lives were for a short time reflected more prominently in national priorities and policies including the national minimum wage childcare support sure start carers rights and flexible working since then the wholesale monetising of society has downgraded what we ought to value namely time care and work patterns that do not conform to the alphamale city norm the ignorance of many womens lives displayed at westminster means females have experienced since what feminist economists in the womens budget group call triple jeopardy they have been hit hardest by the bedroom tax and other benefit changes by the axing of thousands of public sector jobs and by the disintegration of public services including care for the elderly add to that the pandemic of underemployment in which overqualified women are forced to take parttime deadend jobs because a proper position does not come with the flexibility or the income to pay a year for a fulltime nursery place this is not about womens issues it goes to the heart of the countrys productivity crisis it is the padlock that means men who want a greater hand in bringing up their children cannot afford the lost income children care and a real career in a parttime occupation are not the only concerns of women and may not bother some women at all but whether they are tory devotees who run successful businesses or election refuseniks struggling to find a home they can afford womens views on the economy the nhs foreign affairs taxation trident immigration the european union crime et al is refracted through the prism of their female experience and that has too small a place in westminster once upon a time a hope for change lay in the election of more women mps and labours allfemale shortlists

eleanor tanner and andrew hutchinson are expecting their first child in early may the couple who live in tooting broadway london plan on taking advantage of the shared parental leave scheme by each taking six months off work to care for their baby tanner who is an employment lawyer will take leave from her job a few weeks before her due date when she returns to the office hutchinson who works in finance in surrey will take over as fulltime carer for their baby using up the remaining leave i dont want to be the stereotypical dad of my parents generation where he goes off to work and she stays home with the kids said hutchinson i want to be bonding with the baby when its very small i think itll be good for me itll be good for the baby and good for eleanor as well tanner said taking six months away from work feels more manageable than being absent for an entire year i think itll be easier for me to pick up careerwise and easier personally said tanner i like the idea of our child being cared for by its parents for the first year but im not sure i want to take a year out thats a really long time hutchinson said they may have pursued this arrangement under the old parental leave laws but the high profile of the new scheme made it easier for him to talk to his employer about leave arrangements but while the couple have been able to make the new system work for them they described the legislation as horrid and complicated im an employment lawyer and i find it very difficult to get my head around said tanner if it takes me minutes to work out what forms to fill in and thats my job what about the poor person who comes across this for the first time i wouldnt be surprised if they gave up the couple said that among their male friends there was still a fear that if they asked their employer for time off it would be frowned upon and hurt their career prospects hopefully this legislation will allow more men to take leave which can only be a good thing said tanner but she said she would like britain to go further and adopt a scandinavianstyle system where a portion of the leave was only available to the father and would be lost if he did not take it that would be fantastic it shouldnt be about the mother giving up her leave to share with her partner it should be about the father having an entitlement hopefully were progressing in that direction she

the aims are bold to challenge the norm for new working mothers propel more women through the glass ceiling and fashion a generation of nurturing fathers as shared parental leave spl comes into force it would seem to be a giddy step toward a genderequal utopia working parents of babies born or children adopted become the first to qualify but experts are not predicting an overnight revolution this latest legislative step it seems may not quite go far enough under the new arrangements parents can take up to weeks off shared between them following the first two weeks after birth and receive statutory pay it is hoped this will banish the old assumption of the woman as the parent who will stay at home with the newborn and provide alternative role models for generations of young to come but according to academic dr jana javornik who researches care labour and equalities issues across europe the uks efforts are a lighttouch solution in reality finances will dictate that for many couples its business as usual unless an employer is more generous pay will be at the statutory level for of the weeks based on the salary of the parent on leave for the first six weeks the person on leave will receive of his or her average weekly earnings before tax after which it will be or whichever is lower for weeks for those mothers whose partner earns more without an enhanced spl allowance it makes little financial sense for them to sacrifice the more generous wage critics say this is where the uk has not been bold enough when sweden became the first country to introduce shared leave in there was just takeup since then it has added daddy quotas time off specifically allocated to fathers on a use it or lose it basis gender equality bonuses encourage parents to share leave more equally an allowance of of salary for the first of the days leave available is another incentive around of men now take some time off though this is usually the nontransferable part iceland is unique in framing its legislation around the rights of a child to be cared for by both parents it has a formula three months for each parent with the remaining three months shared after sweden introduced the daddy quota there was a really rapid increase in takeup by fathers said javornik a work care and global transitions fellow at leeds universitys school of sociology and social policy when sharing leave is left to parents to decide it kind of doesnt work she said the british governments failure to propose a more forceful use it or lose it structure designed to create incentives and not just rights means this wellintentioned effort to degender childcare rings hollow i think it is a very important step the uk is making but it still places the responsibility for childcare in the mothers hands the way it is done is overly complicated and rather than giving dads an independent right it leaves women fundamentally in charge it would not she said affect the socalled motherhood penalty discrimination by employers reluctant to employ women as they might take time off for motherhood it is challenging public attitudes it is an important step forward but the time is ripe to start thinking more boldly and actually challenge gender equality and gender roles said javornik the fatherhood institute lobbied hard for daddy quotas and is disappointed at a watered down policy which it says amounts to transferable maternity leave implementing a use it or lose it portion for fathers or partners would make it very clear to everybody and crucially to employers that this is not just womens stuff it is stuff that everybody wants and arguably needs to do said the thinktanks spokesman jeremy davies the tuc estimates that around of working parents will not be eligible because either the mother doesnt have a paid job or the couple do not meet the requirement of being with the same employer for at least weeks by the end of the th week before the due date or adoption match mary mercer from the institute of employment studies said one fear is that companies with lovely enhanced maternity packages because they are so keen to bring women back to work would end up not really bothered about enhancing spl as few parents could take a less financially beneficial package it will be business as usual it was costly to enhance spl so some companies might look at ways of reducing maternity enhancement she said one option open to employers might be to just enhance certain blocks of spl a month or two months but taken in a solid block that is easier for employers to work around ben black director of my family care which provides familyfriendly solutions to large companies said it had had hundreds of thinktanks and loads of employers discussing implementation problems in particular the impact of employees taking a month here or there as to takeup he said even the scandinavians faced the issue of professional women marrying professional men three or four years older who earned more enhanced paternity pay or enhanced spl might come at the expense of reduced maternity packages he said according to a recent survey of people by my family care and workingmumscouk of couples would not consider spl although said they would change their decision if their company enhanced it one in four were unaware of the changes while nearly one third were confused most confusion was over split days which allow parents up to days to work during leave to keep in touch its a really positive step forward but its going to take a while for momentum to grow said workingmumscouk founder gillian nissim in sweden one generation on from the introductionmany more fathers are now practising the kind of fatherhood they did not experience in their own childhood according to a study at gothenburg university by anders chronholm not only has their parental leave resulted in a closer relationship to their child according to chronholm it has also had a positive effect on their partners possibilities for work or study one other benefit it transpired was that it opened their eyes to how much time is actually needed to do daily housework as a result found it led to a more equal distribution of housework one more small step towards utopia how it works shared parental leave spl and shared parental pay shpp are available for working parents whose baby is due or who adopt

following birth or adoption it can be stopped and started one partner can start spl while the other is on maternity leave or both can be on spl at the same time so both parents can be home together for weeks if they wish or they can stagger it mothers can end their maternity leave after two weeks and parents can split the remaining weeks any way they like shpp is a week unless an employer offers an occupational splshpp scheme spl is for couples rather then single parents and couples must share the main responsibility for caring for the child if the employee is a mother she can opt into spl

new rules heralding scandinavianstyle shared parental leave of up to weeks come into force this weekend as concerns continue that many employers are not ready for the complicated and challenging changes from sunday parents who both work have the right to take up to almost a year off after having a baby or adopting a child mothers will continue to take the first two weeks the compulsory part of maternity leave and fathers will also still be entitled to two weeks paternity leave but it is nowpossible to transfer the remaining maternity leave to the father or in theory to share it since the measure was first announced months ago by nick clegg the deputy prime minister it has won plaudits from family groups and advocates of women in the workforce but employers particularly small business say there are still coming to terms with the policy which at the time was labelled by some as a disaster employment law specialists irwin mitchell said many uk businesses are simply unprepared for the seachange in working patterns that this represents the firms chris tutton added that employers could face allegations of discrimination particularly from male staff if they repeatedly rejects requests for leave the scheme which has been one of the liberal democrats flagship policies has also been criticised for ruling out many stay at home parents according to a tuc study of new fathers will not be eligible because the mother does not have a paid job the concept has been the norm across scandinavian countries for years but with generous payments for new parents this will not be the case in the uk however unless an employer offers an enhanced package pay will be of a workers average weekly earnings before tax for the first six weeks and then a week or of average weekly earnings whichever is lower for the next weeks in total of the weeks will be paid meaning many families simply wont be able to afford to take the full time off parents have already been able to share some parental leave with the father allowed to take up to six months after the child reaches weeks but relatively few men have taken up the opportunity each year working couples are expected to be eligible although the government predicts that just couples will take advantage in the first year negating its impact employees are not guaranteed the right to take the time off they request following an outcry by business leaders new parents will be required to give their employer eight weeks notice of their intention to take leave there will be a cap on requesting separate blocks of time off at three per employee provided you give the right notice employers cannot refuse leave but they can refuse discontinuous blocks of leave said marian bloodworth an employment lawyer at berwin leighton paisner attitudes of employers appear to have shifted in andrew yates the founder of software company artesian solutions described the measure as a disaster this week the chairman of the federation of small businesses john allen was more considered saying the measure has the potential to enable more women to return to work sooner after childbirth nevertheless the rules are complicated and many small firms will find them challenging to implement clearly though the reforms will need to be closely monitored both in terms of their impact on business but also employee takeup rates he added estelle brachlianoff a vicepresident at the waste management company veolia was much more upbeat for too long our archaic parental leave laws have hampered career womens opportunities by not giving them the option to share leave with their husbands its about time we recognise womens careers are just as important as mens this is an approach fit for the st century and something men and women will equally welcome she said how the uk compares swedens policy is particularly generous with parents having had the right to shared leave since parents receive days of leave including at around of their salary for each child with days exclusively for each parent and the remaining shared the danes have a similarly generous scheme in norway the fathers quota was introduced in and now totals weeks in the rest of europe new mothers mostly get between and weeks paid leave for fathers ranges from two days in greece to three months in italy germany allows parents up to months on of salary france allows both parents to share up to two years of unpaid leave while in spain its three years parents in the us do not get paid leave but can take up to weeks unpaid,2015-04,new rule heralding scandinavianstyle shared parental

the upcoming general election is expected to be an exceptionally closely fought battle and right now the polls suggest that more women than men are currently undecided that means that the ability to reach out to female voters on social media could become an important political strategy new research from bbc trending has found a startling gender split among twitter users tweeting political party hashtags over the past month bbc trending found that of tweets containing such hashtags came from men compared to just by women its difficult to pinpoint the exact gender split of twitters million uk users as the company itself doesnt release this information but when social media monitoring platform beevolve studied million twitter user profiles in it discovered there was a roughly even gender split worldwide with female to male users of course even if we assume that roughly half of the uks twitter users are female it is still possible that men use hashtags more frequently so i asked marcus beard a political analyst at social analytics company brandwatch about the gender split in uk twitter conversations about politics including those without hashtags after analysing just over m twitter mentions of general election topics over the past seven days brandwatch produced very similar data to the bbc trending findings with of political tweets coming from men and just from women both bbc trending and brandwatch pointed out that there is some margin for error as algorithms are used to determine gender from account usernames but even taking this into account the gap remains significant as a final control test to check whether men are simply more prolific tweeters than women i asked beard to run a similar search on the gender breakdown of tweets about the most genderneutral topic i could think of the weather fortyeight per cent of the results were tweets from women and from men so while we should be cautious about the exact figures it seems that there is definitely an unexplained gender disparity in political conversations on twitter the question is why dr heather savigny senior lecturer in politics at bournemouth university suggests that the gap might reflect the wider problem of female disengagement with party politics politics in our media is conducted in a very male space she says so research shows that male politicians are much more likely to be reported about than female politicians and where they are discussed it is much more likely to be about their clothes or appearance if the mainstream media normalises the idea that politics is something men do then it becomes entirely consistent that female voters are less likely to engage than men on and offline fiona mackay professor of politics at the university of edinburgh agrees it is still the case that at headline level women are less politically engaged by the conventional definition than men so its no surprise that follows through to social media both savigny and mackay warn that online hostility and abuse may also be partly responsible for silencing womens voices in the political debate mackay explains anecdotal evidence suggests that online misogyny is amplified when women are seen to be speaking out of turn expressing opinions in areas seen as the domain of men whether about online gaming or politics that some women hang on in there and refuse to be silenced is to be celebrated but i can quite understand why others would decide not to put their heads above the virtual parapet seyi akiwowo a labour councillor for newham and an active tweeter says i think another explanation is our definition of politics women have so many views and great opinions on many societal issues not just child care and i think and have seen the majority of women on twitter do express these views these views many not fit in our traditional understanding of politics which i think is actually a synonym of party politics in the uk i also think the lack of female representation in politics particularly women of colour has a part to play in the degree of inclusivity of the political discussions on twitter she says while both general disengagement and social media abuse may play some part in explaining womens absence from these conversations grazia political editor gaby hinsliff suggests there may also be other factors at play political hashtagging isnt a normal activity it is a rarefied circle of people who at midafternoon on a wednesday can down tools at work and tweet about the budget she says most people doing that are probably professionally involved in some capacity when you consider that men make up around fourfifths of mps two thirds of local government officials and the majority of political journalists it all becomes clear as hinsliff points out its a male dominated circle hinsliff also notes that there is a significant difference between tweeting in general and tweeting under a hashtag which is by definition designed to attract attention to your opinions and to insert them into a wider conversation particularly when it comes to politics she suggests there is a fear of not being qualified to contribute joining a hashtag is like joining a conversation often with quite a cliquey group of people and you dont join in unless you think you know enough about the topic i think some women are quite hesitant about that its a phenomenon that she fears is carried over into voting habits im horrified by how many young women say theyre not voting because they dont know enough not that they hate politicians or dont think their vote counts its the most common answer ive heard you could take that as disengagement but i dont think it is its the fear of not being an expert i dont think ive ever heard a man say that as a reason for not voting however the gender balance of the conversation can shift depending on the political figures being discussed says mackay womens levels of political interest tend to increase when they come into contact with women politicians running as candidates standing mps in their locality or highprofile female role models the brandwatch data reflects precisely this phenomenon with a higher proportion of women involved in twitter conversations about female party leaders for example while just of tweets discussing nick clegg and of tweets about david cameron came from women the figure increased to for tweets about natalie bennett and for those about nicola sturgeon suggesting that the presence of more highprofile women in politics may help to bring other women to the table a twitter spokesperson said the company does not comment on thirdparty studies but added its worthwhile noting that of twitter users do not actively tweet instead using the platform for information and discovery so as well as tweeting people come to twitter to listen to conversations and opinions on political and social issues and find out about how politics affects the things that matter to them hinsliff agrees that its important to remember there is more than one way to engage online a lot of hashtagging is quite pointless and theres an element of women being more practical about their politics i can see the point in voting but can i see the point in staying up till two in the morning arguing ferociously with someone ive never met no not really ultimately regardless of the reason why the fact that womens voices are muted in political debates on any platform should matter to politicians as walthamstow labour parliamentary candidate stella creasy points out women are not a special interest group between women there are differences as well as between men and women what is important is that we recognise that we miss out in the political debate unless we hear a range of voices and range of ideas because that makes your policymaking and decisionmaking better so for me the worry isnt oh dear women arent having their say its what are we missing out on do you think disengagement online abuse fear of getting

next week a new parental leave policy goes into effect in the uk extending the length of leave for up to weeks after the birth or adoption of a baby with of the weeks subsidised after the first two weeks a mother in a twoearner family can transfer all or some of the remaining weeks to the father allowing her to go back to work earlier and him to stay home longer than in the past as someone living in the us where there is no guaranteed paid leave for mothers let alone fathers its tempting to look at the uk policies and say count your blessings but as a researcher who has studied how mens secondary role at home and womens secondclass role at work are mutually reinforcing i believe there is good reason to ask for more than is currently on offer for one thing fathers are only eligible for leave if their wives are also employed outside the home the pay rates for male leavetakers are also pegged too low making the financial penalty for paternal leavetaking prohibitively high for many families and as long as the leave is transferable the experience of other countries suggests that in most families the mother will still use the bulk of it only when countries combine generous pay replacement with a useitorloseit quota for men does fathers participation rise significantly some might say that if a couple really want the mother to take the entire leave we should respect that choice but when women first won the right to apply for jobs and promotions that were formerly reserved for men many hesitated to take full advantage of the new opportunities only with active encouragement and recruitment including the establishment of quotas did women gain the confidence and experience to take on new challenges at work men are in a similar position today when it comes to exercising their rights and obligations in the family many of them hesitate to claim family responsibilities traditionally associated with women fearing theyll be penalised if they deviate from traditionally masculine roles in this regard they are right studies show that men who take family leave are more likely to be harassed at work face a greater risk of being demoted and earn significantly less than other male employees over the long run no wonder so few men take family leave in countries that fail to make caregiving a social norm for fathers as well as mothers but recent research also suggests that once some fathers are induced to take paternity leave others will follow suit in norway for example researchers found that having just one person in a workplace or family take leave increased the chance that a coworker would also do so by and that a brother would do so by furthermore the experience of taking leave changes mens behaviour even after they return to work altering the division of labour at home and at work for years to come sociologist ankita patnaik found that after quebec increased parental leave benefits and established a use it or lose it fiveweek quota for fathers in mens takeup rates increased by by of eligible men were using the leave and the duration of their leaves had increased by even after exhausting their leave these fathers kept doing more cooking and shopping while their partners increased their paid labour a study of the impact of one daddy quota reform in norway found that couples who bore their last child just after the reform were more likely to share laundry duties than those who had their last child just before the reform not surprisingly they also reported fewer conflicts over housework the longer the leave the greater its impact in sweden fathers who take longer leaves than average remain more involved in childcare and household work than fathers who take shorter leaves just as every generation of working women has passed on more egalitarian values to their children each generation of involved fathers will do the same young men were much more likely to share housework and childcare with their partner if they saw their fathers doing so when they were children and daughters of handson fathers are less likely to be channelled into traditional gender roles at home in norway girls born after the paternity leave reform were assigned fewer household chores as teenagers many years after their fathers had returned to work than their counterparts born just before it there is already ample research showing that workplaces function better when women are integrated into positions of responsibility but it also appears that families run more smoothly when men are integrated into household responsibilities in the uk sweden and the netherlands couples in which fathers are more involved in childcare have a lower rate of divorce than couples where the man is less involved throughout the nordic countries men who take parental leave are less likely to dissolve their unions in the united states where lowincome cohabiting couples with children tend to have very unstable relationships a fathers involvement in childcare lowers the risk of dissolution and slightly increases the chance that a couple will marry at some point there is even evidence to suggest that recent upturns in fertility in several european countries are associated with increases in the contribution of fathers to childcare and core domestic chores working women who see their partner spend time in primary childcare after the birth of a child are more likely to consider having a second child the first stage of the gender revolution which involved integrating women more fully into the public sphere destabilised traditional malefemale relationships but as brown university demographer frances goldscheider argues the next stage which involves integrating men more fully into the private sphere may actually strengthen family relationships as for those diehards who think that the erosion of traditional gender roles is emasculating men and creating women who put their work life above their love life a new us study shows

ah the internet simultaneously an exciting tool for creating feminist movements and affecting change and an introduction agency to the notsonice yes we have this terrific space where symbols and symptoms of sexism are brought to their knees by tweeters bloggers and online petitions yet anyone who has ever said anything feministy online will be aware that they can be left to drown in a murky pool of abuse chances are a range of complete strangers will take time out of their busy days to offer you their viewpoints and suggestions heres just a few i run into regularly die lol ack for a surprising number of people someone they dont know discussing the issue of female objectification or womens representation in the media will upset them so much they want you to die sometimes they even offer to help you obviously you dont have to respond at all if the threat is violent consider going to the police but there are other ways of dealing with these armchair death squads you could offer to help the person by explaining that their response was a bit extreme and that they may possibly want to talk to someone about it or maybe you could go for a zen approach along the lines of we are all of us dying and being reborn in every moment zing youre just jealous i heard this frequently over my years working on the no more page campaign and liked to combat it by suggesting an alternative reality i asked people to imagine that rather than it being breasts that have been on page for the past years news corp had decided that young big hairless scrotums were what its readers wanted to see perhaps men would speak up saying that they wanted them to drop these scrotum pictures that they wanted their sons to feel they could do anything in the world and yet when they walked down the street to buy a paper they were grabbed ogled and shouted at by people who wanted to see a bit more scrotum in this parallel universe men had become so worried about the size of their balls that they were using surgery to make them bigger and were insisting that the reason why they were small was because it was cold or that they hadnt finished growing yet the response women and some other men would snort derisively that they were jealous and bitter see youre a flatchested minger youll be told youre unattractive in a variety of embarrassingly uncreative ways online for instance i had years of youve got shit tits which isnt entirely true the irony is that i spent decades being ashamed of my rather fine breasts which was in large part thanks to growing up with page when youre years old and the men around you talk about the breasts in their newspaper everyday it shapes the way you see your own its particularly damaging given that breasts in the media are of a staggeringly uniform shape and size i debunked all of this harmful nonsense in my s and was finally able to say i love my boobs in fact i started the campaign for partly that reason only to be swiftly reminded by strangers that they were still shit you could say something fairly direct and equally loathsome in response slagging off their body their face their tiny penis etc but theres something inherently unsatisfying about that just say something gnomic such as we are all one or reach for the surreal by naming the first town you can think of like swindon there are more important issues to worry about whatever it is you campaign about you will at some point be told that there is another issue vastly more important that you should be focusing on it could be the incipient sexism of womens magazines which demand perfection and then denounce it in the same breath fgm or world peace most people campaign on a whole range of issues and recognise that concern about one doesnt preclude you from caring about others but if you encounter this you could simply say in passing tonight is media sexism night tomorrow is fgm saturday well tackle the pixelated upskirt shots in the star but a more effective method is to simply question the strangers own humanitarian work try asking them how they organise their own activism or ask them what issues they focus on and how you can get involved as a last resort try observing that once we have empowered and liberated half the population of the world through feminism imagine what we could achieve globally finish by adding a smiley what about the men at some point you will hear a plaintive voice wail what about the men they might add that men experience domestic violence and are objectified too a good question to ask here is are you involved in any projects that work to help boys and men feminism as far as i have witnessed is a lot of women and men trying to make life a bit better safer and kinder for future generations of girls and women with an additional perk that it also makes life easier for men as well yes there are issues that affect men too but a movement for men and boys would be more effective working alongside feminism supporting and gaining strength from it not setting itself up in opposition how to start a revolution by lucyanne holmes is published in paperback and ebook by corgi,2015-04,ah internet simultaneously exciting

monday nights panorama about changes to the provision of legal aid pulled a couple of punches perhaps it was the lack of time or perhaps it was viewed as too political for the bbc but the fact is that parliaments justice committee recently looked at the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders laspo legislation which means that some victims of domestic abuse who cannot afford a lawyer have to face their alleged abusers in court without the protection a lawyer would bring the justice report was published just three weeks ago it follows the damning reports of the national audit office in november and the public accounts committee in february and is no less critical it found that the ministry of justice has failed in three of its four objectives for laspo it has not discouraged unnecessary and adversarial litigation at public expense because the courts and tribunals are having to meet the costs of a significant rise in litigants in person and a corresponding fall in mediation it has failed to target legal aid at those who need it most because it has failed to properly implement the exceptional cases funding scheme and it has failed to prove that it has delivered better overall value for money for the taxpayer because it has no idea at all of the knockon costs of the legal aid changes to the public purse as to some of the issues raised in the panorama programme the justice committee recommended that there should be legislation to prevent crossexamination of complainants by alleged abusers in the family courts while ensuring justice is done to all parties this protection has been afforded to witnesses in the criminal courts since and the lack of it has been the subject of adverse judicial comment since most recently by the president of the family division sir james munby legal aid is available to seek protective orders against domestic violence but it is not available to deal with court applications regarding custody or financial issues unless an applicant can provide one of the prescribed forms of evidence these are difficult and expensive to procure and the charity rights of women provided evidence to the committee suggesting that of women who were victims of domestic violence were not able to obtain the evidence to qualify for legal aid also the most common forms of domestic abuse are emotional and psychological which are almost impossible to provide evidence for further injustice is caused by the rigid requirement that any evidence provided must relate to events that occurred no more than months prior to the application thus a woman who flees a violent partner with the children will not get legal aid if he tracks her down and makes an application to see the children two years later she will be required to represent herself and face crossexamination by him if she seeks to prove violence by him which renders him a risk to the children this scenario is not uncommon at the moment the committee recommended the introduction of a wider discretion to grant legal aid to victims of domestic violence who do not fit within the current criteria it recommended that there ought to be discretion to allow evidence of historic domestic violence in cases where the person who has suffered the violence would be materially disadvantaged by having to face the perpetrator in court it also considered that the ministry of justice should take steps to ensure that victims of domestic violence not be expected to pay for production of the required documentary evidence on march the ministry of justice began gathering information on cases where direct crossexamination of a vulnerable witness by a litigant in person is or threatens to be an issue we are told a research study will explore the ways of managing these cases and protecting the witnesses these consequences of laspo were not only predictable but predicted perhaps the panorama programme will awaken politicians across the political spectrum and help them understand that vulnerable people need better protection in court our forefathers who designed and developed legal aid understood that the justice committee gets it its easy to say that if you need a lawyer you should pay for it but it wasnt thought through and the consequences are coming home to roost,2015-04,monday night panorama change provision legal aid pulled couple punch perhaps wa

some welcome news for working moms you can stay late at the office tonight and your kid will be just fine a new study published this april in the journal of marriage and family shows that the widelyheld belief that young children do better when their mothers spend significant time with them is actually wrong kids are okay no matter how many hours mom works in fact the stress of trying to live up to unrealistic parenting standards is likely more detrimental to children than a lack of time spent together the socalled mommy wars arent just hurting women theyre hurting kids as well the researchers from three different universities wrote that the larger cultural debate over womens worklife balance and parenting is what in part sparked their interest in the topic mothers time is thought to be especially important even irreplaceable for the wellbeing of children but despite the neverending guilt mothers are expected to feel for working outside the home the results of the study showed that the amount of time parents mothers in particular spend with young children doesnt have a statistically significant impact on their development or wellbeing what does make a difference moms social status resources like her level of education and family income but chiding women for being bad parents is far more popular than working to provide all families with support structures and resources like parental leave and affordable child care melissa milkie one of the studys authors and a sociology professor at the university of toronto told me that moms are under a lot of cultural pressure theres the belief that moms are the one responsible moms are the one who should be there and that pressure a piece of what the researchers call mothers general distress does negatively impact kids the worrying about time spent with our kids could it seems be more harmful that the lack of time spent itself and while moms are so often led to believe that the early years of their childs life is where their time matters most the study shows its actually older children that benefit from engaged family time professor milkie said that teens whose parents both mom and dad spend time doing activities with them fare better than teens with less engaged time but still professor milkie said moms are the ones who are held individually responsible they feel they have to do everything on their own she told me the sad truth is that we are far more interested in making women feel terrible about their life choices under the guise of caring about children than we are in actually helping children and so long as the conversations about parenting focus on womens choices namely whether theyre right wrong or selfish the debate will go nowhere professor milkie said that we need to look at the big picture of what children really need its not necessarily more time with mothers but things that support parents and mothers she explained policies that support parents and mothers include a living wage affordable child care and flexible work arrangements that yes allow moms and dads to spend more time with their kids not because children will suffer if they dont have that time but because we love our kids and hanging out with them is fun and rewarding i dont expect that this study or any others will be enough to convince some people that we can value both parenting and the role of women in the public sphere but maybe just maybe its enough to convince moms to stop feeling quite as guilty when we have to work late our kids are fine without us some times a truth i think a lot of us already know even if were not quite ready to admit it,2015-04,welcome news working mom stay late office tonight kid fine new study published april journal marriage family show widelyheld belief

allmale panels are a familiar sight for anyone who has ever attended a work conference or spent time at sxsw for the uninitiated an allmale panel is exactly what it sounds like a group of mostly white men plunked on stage at a conference usually under the auspices of being the experts in their fields whether that field is agrarian developments in the sudan developments in the music industry advances in chemical engineering global banking regulation or even womens reproductive rights after years of noticing this phenomenon dr saara srm a researcher in international relations at the university of tampere in finland began collecting images of them on facebook soon people added their own to the collection leading to the creation of all male panels tumblr she added a photo of baywatch star david hasselhoff giving a thumbs up to each post to further make light of the situation its clear srm has struck a nerve as several of the images have gone viral the guardian talked to srm about the photos the changes shes hoping to see and why david hasselhoff is the perfect mascot for the project where did this idea come from ive been seeing this thing for a long time im an international relations scholar and ive seen in security studies and foreign policy these hardcore fields theres a lot of allmale panels ive been talking about it for a long time with my feminist colleagues all over the world in february i decided to start doing something about it and started collecting these pictures first it was just in finland there were a few events that really brought it on there was a course called politics and facts and it was advertised as having the best experts in the country as lecturers and it was men i work with women who would have been perfect for this class so i started collecting these and they started piling up what has the response been like first it was slow some of my immediate academic circles were sharing it and some feminist and academic organizations shared it on facebook and twitter then buzzfeed picked it up and it went on from there it has been great ive gotten a lot of amazing feminist connections all over the place and getting amazing feedback i have about submissions now where have the submissions come from mainly from the west the states the uk australia the netherlands mexico quite a bit someone asked if they could start one in spanish and i said yes go ahead do the same thing i dont mind your tumblr seem to tap into a zeitgeist thats happening right now where people are paying more attention to things like allmale panels yes i think thats true theres also owen barders the pledge where men take a pledge not to be on allmale panels then there was a stop man panels site which is by article which is the antinuclear movement i think that movement has been doing this for a year or two but i think the humor added on it is what made it go viral speaking of your sites humor what made you think to incorporate david hasselhoff into it i think its really funny it was a joke to begin with but hes this s knight rider type hes the embodiment of white masculinity so i think it worked really well to have him congratulating these people on their job well done you put together an allmale panel he did a talkshow in finland this year its airing now i actually went to a taping which was quite funny it was in january which coincides with this whole manpanel project what do you hope will come from your efforts im a realist in the way that i dont think we can achieve equality very quickly im hoping that people will no longer organize allmale panels and wont go on allmale panels at least a small change if there are fewer allmale panels from now on that would be a good outcome as an academic why do you think diversity on a panel is so important it brings different viewpoints we have to think about diversity more and how to make it happen and how to get different viewpoints across also i think its important to learn how to listen to different viewpoints its not about counting though its not just the number of women and men on a panel and nobody wants to be the token woman on a panel or in these really masculine fields which can be quite hostile instead i want to challenge the culture in academia to think about how we do panels and how we treat each other while your tumblr focuses on gender it could just as easily apply to racial diversity too i actually started an allwhite panel tumblr as well but it only has about four things right now ive been asking people to go through the allmale panel tumblr and download the ones that are allwhite as well and submit it to the other one so i can upload them there i just dont have time to do it all right now someone sent me a link to a seminar on indigenous studies and it was all nonindigenous people its the same with the womens world summit or whatever it was called that had an allmale panel just classic or the us senate hearing on reproductive rights which was an allmale panel i guess the one woman wasnt qualified or something laughs the panels that have to do with gender that are all male are always surprising although they shouldnt be its where the power is and wherever the power is located is where you find these allmale panels in finland we are in the middle of government negotiations and they are really manly since weve had a nearly equal number of women and men ministers in the government now there is a real fear that the principle is getting thrown out the window they are saying that they are going to have the most qualified person but who is most qualified is not an objective thing its a value judgment we tend to see men as more qualified or as more of an expert generally finland is considered progressive on gender issues so the fact that youre seeing these allmale panels is a little disheartening in finland we tend to think oh were so equal and people say oh feminists what are you complaining about here gender equality is a process it goes backward and it goes forward and its really dangerous to think that weve already achieved it theres a lot of that kind of thinking in finland that weve achieved gender equality and now feminists are taking it too far as if you could take equality too far when by definition you cant be too equal,2015-05,allmale panel familiar sight anyone ha ever

when i first joined the womens movement in the late s i was sneered at for watching romcoms for preferring dogs to cats and as time went on refusing to go to greenham common i like a shower the telly and clean clothes i dont camp since then my cultural choices havent become any more obviously feminist if i were asked to describe my ideal evening at home it would involve cooking rabbit watching the godfather part ii listening to the album tha doggfather by rap artist snoop dogg while sinking a bucket of wine snoops music has a clear strain of sexism but that has never stopped me listening to it in i watched as he showed up at the mtv awards with two women in dog collars and leashes and in i went to the glastonbury festival my idea of hell as i said i really dont like camping to see snoop live on stage i own no fewer than four of his cds this week snoop announced that after years of calling women whores and bitches he has changed his ways and will from now on respect us and while this might make it easier for me to enjoy his music the truth is that as a longtime fan i have never really worried that my musical taste could end up with my feminist membership card being revoked i have never subscribed to the orthodoxy of the left and find stringent groupthink tedious how do i reconcile my feminism with the sexism in some of the pop culture i love there are certainly some feminists who try to police what they watch and listen to quite carefully when i interviewed the iconic feminist shere hite for instance she told me she only watched films by female directors now there are some fantastic women making films but because of sexism and discrimination the vast majority of films are still made by men cut all those out and youre left with a very limited selection when it comes to songs its not unusual for the beat and the artists voice to be brilliant but the lyrics offensive as with snoops back catalogue in recent years some feminists have responded particularly strongly to this issue with many british student unions banning the song blurred lines on the grounds that it is deeply offensive and dangerous there are lines i do observe when i notice them i recall one embarrassing but hilarious moment while singing karaoke at my th birthday party i was halfway through tom joness delilah when i realised that it was a song about a jealous man killing his unfaithful wife this was an all too real occurrence that i was actively campaigning against at the time to be a feminist is to live with daily contradictions and inconsistencies in order to exist in the world and consume pop culture its difficult to avoid hardcore sexism hiphop is one of my favourite music genres but the dominant message is often about men being in control being hateful to women and throwing their guns and money around while posing with flash cars as my friend byron hurt said following the success of his film hiphop beyond beats and rhymes rich white male music moguls promote african american rap artists with an image that perpetuates the racist stereotype of black men as pimps and gangsters as a white woman who tries to be antiracist it is surely contradictory to my politics that i invest in a genre with this message the women who feature as backing singers or dancers for male hiphop artists are also often portrayed in a racist and sexist way stereotypes of black women are played out in the videos in which they are framed as overly sexualised and animalistic to be clear i do not subscribe to the neoliberal view that individual choices made by women who are at least a bit feminist are even vaguely feminist ones i dont think pole dancing or prostitution is liberating despite the constant suggestions that feminism is all about personal choice tripping about in spike heels is not a feminist act and nor is having cosmetic surgery such as breast enlargement or having a toe removed to fit into the latest blahniks so i dont think that because a woman is a feminist all her actions are too and i also dont think that engaging occasionally in sexist pop culture makes someone less of a feminist i do plenty of things that are not feminist on a daily basis such as watching reruns of carry on films and buying products from companies that pay women less than men the truth is that if feminists especially those of us who prioritise the campaign to end male violence against women restricted themselves to entertainment that was perfectly nonsexist perfectly pure we would be pretty miserable and have very little to watch or listen to no football because of the machismo and sexist chants a ban on books and tv programmes that are based on violence against women i would need to throw away all my crime novels and never watch the killing again as a feminist under the system of patriarchy to live a life without contradiction means i would have to wall myself off from the wider world of music film and literature something im not prepared to do life as an activist could be unremittingly hard if you chose to forego such genuine pleasures to attempt to be ideologically perfect would not only be boring but probably impossible i deflect my guilt by telling myself that i prioritise effecting real and sustainable change for women because while i may occasionally listen to a sexist song or watch a film which is miles from passing the bechdel test as a feminist activist i never ever take time off if judgmental moralists feel that listening to feminist folk music will bring about better change than direct campaigning to end violence against women so be it but i know what i would rather concentrate my efforts on,2015-05,first joined womens movement late wa sneered watching romcoms preferring dog cat time went refusing go greenham common like

we are delighted to see that the new intake of mps means that there are more women ethnic minority and lesbian and gay members in the house of commons than ever before we look forward to seeing what business they bring to the attention of the house but building representative democracy does not stop here it is important that parliaments processes and ways of working also enable the best possible scrutiny of government there is currently a critical gap in these scrutiny arrangements while select committees examine the work of most government departments there is no mechanism for allowing parliament to examine whether government policy and practice and wider activities in both public and private sectors is the best it can be to ensure women and minorities have genuinely fair opportunities to succeed women ethnic minorities disabled people and others do not face barriers to realising their potential in one convenient area of government but across employment health education justice and many other areas we would like to see a new women and equalities select committee created so that our new mps have a place where they can prioritise the assessment of whether government and others are doing their best to ensure equality for all many other parliaments around the world already have such committees including the scottish and european parliaments we hope that

the mattress as a performance art protest against the schools failure to expel her alleged rapist on tuesday mattress performance carry that weight came to an end as sulkowicz hauled it across the stage to applause during her graduation ceremony lauren gambino reported sulkowicz and her mattress became a powerful symbol of the movement to reform campus sexual assault proceedings the protest has earned sulkowicz international attention and an award from the national organization for women lena dunham meanwhile tweeted her support cash for cleaning on new yorks upper east side one anthropologist has been studying what she has classified as a new tribe the glam sahms glamorous stayathome moms writing in the new york times this week the anthropologist wednesday martin explained the socalled phenomenon of the wife bonus granted by hedge fund husbands to their partners for good housewifery it might be hammered out in a prenup or postnup and distributed on the basis of not only how well her husbands fund had done but her own performance how well she managed the home budget whether the kids got into a good school the same way their husbands were rewarded at investment banks women who didnt get them joked about possible sexual performance metrics proof that wealth does indeed come with trappings shouldnt beyonc make jay a steak as us readers bid farewell to david letterman this week bustle ran with the opportunity to round up the late shows six feminist moments that will forever be iconic cue your chance to watch aziz ansaris disbelief at the lacklustre response of an audience asked to clap if theyre feminists i think the reason some people dont clap is that now words are weirdly used in our culture says aziz now people think feminism means some womans gonna start yelling at him but he goes on unless you go to a jay z and beyonc concert and come away thinking beyonc should get less money than jay z then you have to say yes hell yes down at heel cannes might have opened with a femaledirected film for the first time since but the red carpet kicked up a real fuss once it was reported that women were allegedly barred from attending film screenings if they were not wearing high heels the outrage was stoked by the revelation that one of the women chided for her flat shoes was an amputee film producer valeria richter who has had her big toe and part of her left foot amputated told bbc live that red carpet officials pointed at her shoes and said no no this wont work you cant get in like this our own hadley freeman saw herself as a modernday joan of arc fighting the noble fight among the barricades after she braved this years festival in flats but the fault here doesnt lie with cannes or even film festivals she noted but with the hilariously retrograde assumptions about what still constitutes elegance in a woman ive seen some commentators online all men funnily enough snark that its no different to demand women wear high heels than it is to insist men wear bow ties theyre absolutely right of course if bow ties render them next to immobile and leave them in crushing pain with lifelong foot problems the assumption still is that in order to look elegant women have to be in some kind of selfrestraining physical pain because that still apparently is the look of a human woman twitter users rallied with the hashtag showmeyourflats alors director of the festival thierry frmaux denied the existence of a heelsonly dress code and said that ushers have been reminded that flat shoes are allowed but the whole episode is embarrassing for the festival in a year when the festival has tried to put a feminist spin on proceedings yes we cannes and yet is the year for women in film according to john fithian president and ceo of the us national association of theatre owners it will apparently be a recordbreaking year for the us box office something that fithian goes on to say will be because of the number of films aimed at women or featuring women citing cinderella insurgent and fifty shades of grey as films with women in leading roles which sold at least of their tickets to women he said we have so much more to come with big female roles in horror comedy sciencefiction animation family western thriller and action personally i am so pleased that my daughter can see more women in leading roles than ever before first pick of your films with feminist credentials todd haynes adaptation of patricia highsmiths novel carol looks like it fits the bill how i understood my mother for anyone still feeling emo about the end of mad men sarabeth berman this week gave a thoughtful take on the series and her mother in a piece for jezebel in how mad men helped me understand the anger in my mothers feminism berman writes over the years ive wondered how true is it i called my mother to talk to her about the show recently she didnt like it she told me it harkened back to an unpleasant and familiar time it was then that i realized this was what my mother came from no wonder she was so angry i was born years later into a time that felt so different precisely because of all that their mode of chestbeating feminism had achieved i was lucky i realized that my mothers breed of feminism felt so remote today though the issues are different theyre no less urgent the wives of westeros in another ongoing battle for the fair treatment of women in popular culture game of thrones this week featured a rape scene that was for many a grotesquely pointless madefortv addition to the original plot of the books another example of the programme recklessly mixing grisly violations with the titsout titillation that is the usp of cable television writing in new statesman sarah ditum worries where now for the series its hard at this point to think of any satisfactory way for game of thrones to proceed short of daenerys unleashing her dragons and barbecuing every man in the seven kingdoms and maybe the executives of hbo for good measure thrones has stopped being a story about how women survive if it ever really was that and become something much more grim and ordinary just another example of the

concerning and troubling watching society dissolve around us the disintegration of marriage something going terribly wrong hurting our children and tearing us apart these are just a handful of fox news pundits responses to the revelation that of american mothers have become their familys sole or primary breadwinner these were not isolated opinions in recent years headlines across a number of publications have ranged from working mothers damage their childs health to working mothers risk damaging their childs prospects to at the more extreme end of the spectrum how feminism demeans women and destroys families and according to a survey by the pew research center of the us population agreed that the trend towards mothers working outside the home was a bad thing for society just believed it to be a good thing but a new study from harvard business schools recently launched gender initiative shows that working mothers are not the destroyers of marriage and society that some would have us believe the as yet unpublished study of adults in developed countries found that women who grew up with working mothers not only earn more than their peers with stayathome mothers but are also more likely to have supervising roles at work in the us for example adult daughters of working mothers earned more than those whose mothers had not worked outside the home earning an annual average income of compared with more than held supervisory positions compared with roughly of their counterparts whose mothers stayed at home across all the countries in the survey women whose mothers had worked outside the home earned more than daughters from households with a stayathome mother and worked as supervisors compared with of women with stayathome mothers in addition the study revealed that men who had working mothers spend significantly more time caring for their own children while the salaries and positions of the us men surveyed were not affected those who had working mothers spent nearly twice as many hours on family and childcare as those who did not a weekly average of hours compared with hours the reasons for the varying potency of having a working mum are worth considering according to the new york times the effect was strongest in countries in which there was a bigger divide in opinions about the role of women such as the united states and israel and in countries where gender attitudes were more conservative such as russia and mexico it was smallest in countries where there was widespread acceptance of working women such as the nordic countries kathleen mcginn a professor at hbs and one of the authors of the study sums up what the findings mean there is no single policy or practice that can eliminate gender gaps at work and at home but being raised by a working mother appears to come very close this should not however be interpreted as an attack on mothers who stay at home either through choice or financial necessity speaking over email mcginn hbs researcher mayra ruiz castro and elizabeth long lingo of mount holyoke college who authored the study are keen to stress that they are not advocating that all women should work or that mothers who choose to stay at home are limiting their daughters career potential but giving your children opportunities to see and know people men and women making lots of different choices at work and at home will help your children see lots of options possible in their own lives our study shows that having a mother who works for pay is one promising avenue for improving womens outcomes in the workplace and increasing mens involvement at home contrary to widespread belief the researchers also found little evidence to suggest that a mothers choice to work or to stay at home has any major impact on their childrens happiness controlling for education employment income and other demographic variables children of working mums and children of stayathome mums report equal levels of happiness as adults not happier not less happy the results suggest that instead of looking to demonise one set of mothers for getting it wrong we can instead celebrate the fact that there are benefits to be reaped from a wide variety of womens personal choices we hope these findings will challenge stereotypes about working mums harming their children say the reports authors and will help working mums feel confident that they are contributing to their sons and their daughters lives in lots of positive ways we also hope the findings from our research will promote respect for the spectrum of choices women and men make at home and at work so instead of criticising womens choices for hurting their families it is time to celebrate them for the varied and rich benefits they bring and while were at it we might also stop to wonder why fathers parenting decisions and career choices rarely appear in the debate at all,2015-05,concerning troubling watching society dissolve around u disintegration marriage

women around the world will be treated to such an extraordinary feat of feminism in that theyll scarcely know what to do with it no im not talking about the first female president of the united states thats small potatoes instead early next year a new book will present a brave new perspective on feminism that feminist academics and activists have inexplicably ignored for decades how to be hot writer polly vernon who has penned thoughtprovoking pieces such as you hate me because im thin and am i too old for cleavage is writing a book about how feminists can be cool fit and maybe just maybe a little bit thinner finally women are getting the feminism they never asked for vernons book which is excerpted this week in the times magazine is a reaction to a type of feminism that exists largely in the writers head rather than reality what kind of feminist am i now vernon writes the shavyleggy fashionfixated wrinkleaverse weightconscious kind of feminist the kind who at likes hot pink and men because the rest of us are all flannel shirtwearing manhaters with hairy legs this caricature died years ago and any hint that was left beyonc promptly trounced last year vernons real trouble with feminism today is that she and some of her friends finds it judgy theyre wracked with guilt whenever they get a bikini wax or order a salad because feminists dont eat salad as if there is some sort of terrifying feminist overlord checking their netherregions and lunch menus daily vernon writes feminism is increasingly defined by a sense of what you cant do shouldnt say yet ironically her own feminist manifesto is mostly defined in negatives she offers a list in fact of all the things she isnt offended by shes the cool girl who doesnt mind if her boss calls her babe or chick and a revolutionary for not caring if a man holds a door open for her or not as if this has been a point of great feminist debate for years it hasnt no one cares and she doesnt care about how photoshopping female models or celebrities impacts womens selfesteem how many women are represented on political panels on television or if the media makes snide comments about what female politicians wear vernon writes that shes saving her ire for issues like the wage gap rape and access to abortion im glad shes found issues that matter most to her but it seems well stupid to pretend that the important issues arent impacted by those vernon deems silly how many women are represented in political conversations on television matters if youre worried about the public hearing about the pay gap female politicians are much more likely to be prochoice do you really want them dismissed and derided on their clothing choices and while media images of women may not bother some theyre part of a culture that presents women as sexual objects there for mens pleasure if you care about rape you need to care about womens bodies being modified and perfected objects listen i get it feminism is having its cultural zeitgeist moment and vernon wants in and why be a bad feminist when you can be a hot one the title hot feminist titillates and the content is controversial in a bland sort of way if youve never read anything about feminism except what its detractors purport that its about but despite wrongheaded beliefs to the contrary feminism has never been about making women feel good or supporting everything they do its a political and social movement for equality if vernon wants to get behind that great no one will even care if she diets along the way,2015-05,woman around world treated

the furore over mad max fury road amongst mens rights activists is as many have pointed out hilarious it shouldnt surprise anyone who has spent any time monitoring what passes for thought in the assemblage of pickup artists and manchildren who have collectively been christened the redpill right the latest kerfuffle started when aaron clarey the resident economist of the manoandrosphere took to the pages of return of kings a blog for heterosexual masculine men to proclaim that mad max fury road was an affront he hadnt seen it but nonetheless went on to say the real issue is whether men in america and around the world are going to be duped by explosions fire tornadoes and desert raiders into seeing what is guaranteed to be nothing more than feminist propaganda while at the same time being insulted and tricked into viewing a piece of american culture ruined and rewritten right in front of their very eyes its puzzling that such a strong believer in the innate superiority of the male sex a man who thinks genetics guarantee a male victory over feminism would think that antifeminist men could so easily be duped and brainwashed but this kind of strident off the cuff victimology is par for the course in those vast regions of the internet where grown men gather to moan about how everyone is picking on them return of kings is a prominent part of the manosphere a pick up artist site where men are urged to exhibit confidence and strength by essentially tricking women into sleeping with them puas as theyre called claim to instruct men in game so they can reliably get laid its an apt term because it conceives of the path to sexual intimacy as a kind of video game walkthrough where if you learn to press the right buttons in the right sequence youre bound to win men come for the surefire sex tips and leave with a heaping helping of reactionary ideology the real point of pua and the related mens rights movement is not really helping the plight of lonely nerds its disputing the result of the sexual revolution pua game is premised on the idea that women are basically lab rats who will reliably respond to certain stimuli anyone who disputes this idea and any evidence to the contrary like womens increasing economic success and sexual and social confidence are anathema independent women with choices stand as a factual refutation to the watery stew of evolutionary psychology macho posturing and lan party horse sense that these groups subsist on so on any given day on return of kings youll find an ocean of bile directed at individual feminists women in general and the decline that feminisms successes represent to a lesser extent men who accept and support the claims of feminism cop it too theyre dismissed as white knights who are themselves really angling for sex too what the badasses at return of kings love most though is working themselves up over a post about what a particular woman has said and then piling onto her on twitter so its not surprising that the internets angry white men find fury road objectionable a strong female lead in a hollywood action movie would be enough on its own to draw their ire on its own as clarey wrote nobody barks orders to mad max the involvement of women in its production like vagina monologues author eve ensler is even worse but the final straw is that the film shows a man and a woman standing together against the kind of world reactionaries fantasise about inhabiting a postapocalyptic hierarchical society that treats women as chattels and gives free rein to cosplay machismo thats a pretty good picture of the redpill utopia for a woman to take the lead in challenging it and for a man to support her efforts is far too depressing a reminder of the kind of progressive change they impotently rail against clarey is proposing that the manosphere boycott the film which is all the more reason to go get a large popcorn satisfied in the knowledge that its salted with reactionary

heads droop feet drag even rucksacks seem to sag beneath the weight of expectation its not hard to tell the difference between a ray of sunshine and a primary school kid in sats week but this is only the start of exam season for many families with gcses and alevels looming next my sons teenage babysitters stagger into our house beneath piles of revision folders no longer even bothering to ask where the tv remote lives the nights are long and light now but thats no use to the thousands of kids hunched up inside revising at the school gates theres no bigger topic of conversation than the pressurecooker nature of it all the way homework starts aged five the endless cycle of tests and mocks and exams the fear that instead of getting children excited about learning were funnelling stuff into them like little foie gras goslings odd then that none of this ever featured in the election campaign we heard a bit briefly about how schools should be funded and new schools created but there was deafening silence on what schools are actually supposed to do yet exam stress it emerged this week is now responsible for calls a year to childline school worries are among the top problems for which children anonymously seek help more than half of yearolds according to another survey published this week admitted worrying about how sats would affect their still so very distant futures its not just exams themselves that upset children the chesttightening feeling that even adults get at the sight of long rows of desks which is natural enough but the deeper fears beneath will your parents still love you if you screw up are you deep down just not good enough success and failure are hard enough to get into proportion at but friends report primary school kids lying awake at night worrying about pressures they cant fully articulate and arent emotionally mature enough to manage conservative proposals for children who dont reach the expected level by year six the end of primary school to resit sats in secondary school must surely risk increasing the pressure on those who struggle but bright and conscientious children being entered for higher papers meant to stretch them can get just as anxious whats heartbreaking is that it was never meant to be like this no child can pass or fail a sat in theory at least because its a test of the schools performance in getting the child to the required level rather than a test of the child but clearly that message isnt getting through to many children just as setting targets in the nhs only encouraged some doctors to game the system in ways that didnt help patients national testing has unintentionally had harsh consequences for some of them does it have to be this way my sons school handled their year two sats so discreetly that most of the kids didnt even realise theyd done it let alone get stressed thats largely because these tests for sevenyearolds are carried out by their own teachers in class with no fuss or drama by contrast yearolds do their papers in an exam setting many primaries hold sats booster classes at lunchtimes or before and after school and kids are often only too aware that doing badly could hurt their school but its also perhaps because like many schools ours refuses to tell year two parents exactly when sats will be taken the truth is that the pressure on kids doesnt only come from teachers with ofsted on their backs or from education ministers banging on about how singaporean kids excel at maths it sometimes comes directly or indirectly from the very people who worry about it most why are children tested so unrelentingly often because parents want underperforming schools to be identified and tackled they want to know both that kids are leaving primary school having mastered the basics and that when they move on to secondary school their teachers will already have some idea of their strengths and weaknesses national tests were a logical if imperfect political response to these wholly reasonable parental demands and where apart from in school do children get the idea that doing well in these tests is crucial ahem lets just say that no matter how often you swear that you dont care how they do so long as they do their best if youre lying your kids will sense it its natural to want your children to be high achievers both so that every possible door in future life is open to them and be honest for that tiny shameful thrill of vicarious pride but the puzzling thing is that in holding our kids noses to the grindstone we are diligently preparing them for a relentlessly competitive highachieving working life about which we ourselves are often conflicted many working parents quite reasonably object to an alwayson corporate culture of am emails and impossible targets despite enjoying rights to flexible working that our parents never had we still often hanker secretly for more time when a ceo or politician rejects the top job in favour of something less pressurised and more emotionally significant to them we tend to cheer we argue that giving people more control over their hours and the way they approach their work actually boosts productivity regarding the more driven culture of working life in many tiger economies with suspicion yet for our kids somehow we accept the opposite longer hours than we ever put in at their age and an increasingly didactic unimaginative curriculum that threatens to squash the life out of good teaching albeit in an attempt to lift the bad if going to school were a job would you want to do it realistically there will always be a tension in education between what muriel spark via her creation miss jean brodie famously called the leading out of the qualities that are already in a child and the necessary stuffing in of the knowledge that is not theres no going back either on schools being accountable to parents which means some way of publicly measuring childrens progress is nonnegotiable but its hard to believe there is absolutely no better way of doing that and no better balance between brodie and gradgrind when children are this anxious about letting adults down it isnt them who have failed but

keeping a close loving hold on your right to be initially or permanently indifferent is the best way to survive the furious opinionstorm that is social media thats why i highly recommend that we take a lebowski approach to everything vehement online the big lebowski has much to teach us but in this case i want to focus on one deathless line thats just like your opinion man in the movie its a comeback to the claim were gonna fuck you up at bowling but it can also serve to keep contrarianism trolling and hot takes at arms length until they can be evaluated because i am fundamentally less relaxed than the dude i also rely frequently on the more aggro i dont care what you think this makes men very mad which is delightful but lets stick to the cooler one for now we could have used this approach last week for instance when writer sarah miller got the internet all het up by declaring on jezebel that she hated maxi dresses full disclosure sarah is a friend comments on the site included uhhh excuse the fuck out of me but i look goddamn fantastic in a maxi dress how about we just let women wear whatever the fuck they feel comfortable in who the fuck cares and fuck you twitter was similar my stream for a day or so was all impassioned maxi dress defenses and apologias suffice it to say the post struck a nerve around the same time the internet discovered a monthold post on a college site celebrating the dad bod slightly outofshape male physique girls love the dad bod it said the comments on this one were teethgnashing too once the post went viral though the response pieces started dad bods are hotter than sixpacks theyre worse than ebola the whole phenomenon is a sexist atrocity the internet will always reward extreme views with extreme attention if you can manage to average out all the spiky opinions if you can mentally balance dadbod is gross and dadbod is great you cant help but come up with oh well takes all kinds a much less marketable position but a much more comfortable one and the first step is to realize that so many of these massive pronouncements so many of these indictments and screeds are just like someones opinion obviously right and wrong exist i am trusting you guys not to be dumb some people are vehemently in favor of cops shooting unarmed black men and women but this does not average out the people who are vehemently against it the people who are vehemently against it are correct one must consider the source some people love the new mad max and some people hate it but the ones who hate it are virulent misogynists so im still gonna go ill go with the awareness that it still probably isnt the best thing ever just not for those particular reasons use your brain but dont let yourself be manipulated into wasting energy shoving back against something thats just meant to get your goat you can always get another rug,2015-05,keeping close loving hold right initially permanently indifferent best way survive furious

i believe it was mark twain who once said everyone is a moon and has a dark side which she never shows to anybody well listen up moonpeople because it turns out something else also has a dark side equality as the recent ministerial appointment of backtracking antisame sex marriage spanner caroline dinenage as equalities minister suggests a harmonious society centred around the equal treatment of people isnt all it was cracked up to be but though the thatcher principle women can be helmetheaded heartless husks which like the sun eating dragons of chinese mythology are intent on destroying all thats good and true in the world too may have a lot to answer for its not the only downside to equality indeed according to a study by the oecd the dark side of equality is that women now have drinking habits that resemble mens would that these were the days when the only members of the female sex allowed to cross the thresholds of our local taverns were bawdy corsetwearing medieval servingwenches who were as popular mythology dictates the sober but cheerful recipients of unceasing bum gropage failing that a nationwide rollingout of the garricks entrance policy would surely nip this public health crisis in the bud and thats not all as men in tinfoil fedoras across the internet will no doubt confirm drinking is just the tip of the iceberg the violently contracting rosemary woodhouse of equality has breechbirthed many an evil into this world for instance trousers ukip donor demetri marchessini had the inside track on this in when he denounced women in trousers as an abomination saying countless women who would look lovely in dresses or skirts are embarrassingly unattractive in trousers so furious was he about this trend that he wrote an entire book on the subject the magnum opus women in trousers a rear view indeed as unsubstantiated rumours that i just made up have it marchessini demands that any woman in his presence immediately drop trou in order that he is able to photograph the light side of the equality moon voting look at the election results what a mess we have got the country into wasnt it so much better when the men were in charge and we didnt have to muddle our pretty little heads with politics leave the important stuff to our trousered superiors i say instead we could be devoting our mental energy to more important matters such as ringlets embroidery and coathanger abortions money in a blow to worldwide male dominance women now have access to money they might even have their own bank accounts that horror of horrors only require their own signatures to withdraw from but what good are all these cashedup bitches with their fancy swag really doing society its time to face facts it doesnt matter how many times your dad cuts up your mums marks and spencers storecard women having money is basically propping up the global capitalist economy not only that but now we have the financial independence necessary to escape the kitchens you still long to trap us in and file for divorce should we so choose you could argue that giving women money has been an unmitigated disaster but look on the bright side women still arent paid as much as men and thanks to capitalism ramping the beauty industry up a notch in order to keep us oppressed once we got outside of the house we spend most of it on lipstick and diet pills anyway bosses remember that nasty female boss you had in the early s when you wore a brown suit and worked in insurance all the women are like that when they are handed positions of power which is why they must remain secretaries at all cost but hold on to your toupees and wipe the sweat from your vests meninists because we are still a very long way off from the following conversation wheres nick today

they are able to take the odd break from creating incubating expelling feeding and protecting new humans women are unfortunately able to leave the house for brief periods of time probably to have

what does a woman voter want what will she make of this parliament which elements may serve her and which will not are there principles and policies on which all women would from selfinterest or solidarity agree would a womens equality party campaigning on a single issue gender equality bloom as they hope in the way the greens have from their one issue to all issues sandi toksvig who launched wep last month said her decision to leave the news quiz for politics was because its very interesting that most of the mainstream parties seem to treat womens issues as if we were a minority group rather than in fact what we are which is the majority of the country you get childcare talked about as if it was only a womans issue it makes no sense since in most households with children men are also involved on the flip side issues that you could genuinely make the case for were womens even if marginally student fees for instance given that the student body is majority female would make you a laughing stock if you actually described them as such yet because there is a pressing sense of what a useful bloc vote women would be mainstream politics tends to carve out predictable patronising areas of concern that should play well with the female voter whether nicola sturgeon natalie bennett and leanne wood the three female leaders of the snp green party and plaid cymru respectively will have an impact in the longer term remains to be seen are they having a transformational effect on the way we discuss progressive alternatives and if so can that be said in any meaningful way to be related to their femaleness the other key question being asked is will having a parliament that is now made up of rather than women be markedly different or just a bit less internationally embarrassing the problem with women is that we dont all agree we are not all at the same point in our lives we are not all from the same economic class changes that preoccupy some women such as funding for the nhs may not hold very much immediate interest for others changes that purport to benefit all women such as an increase in female workforce participation actually only boost some and hold back others the academic alison wolf has done some fascinating research showing that countries with very good prospects for professional women also have extremely high plus proportions of women doing the very lowpaid care work are they in fact mopping up domestic work for the sake of higher paid women and can a feminist reading of that exist without a marxian one viz that if we wont all do some caring work a tranche of people will end up doing it all nimco ali the fgm campaigner who is on the committee for wep is resolute on the fact that having highprofile women in senior positions both benefited women under the coalition government and will do so again i am highly sceptical about this nicky morgan as education secretary in my view has shown no commitment to protect education spending or allow for inflation or increased pupil numbers this will harm children and inevitably women but also men amber rudd as environment secretary has a stance i admire on renewables as well as abortion as an aside but climate change is not really a womens issue unless you know the future is a female thing individual women run the same spectrum on equality from pioneer to chocolate teapot as individual men do but ali disagrees assessing everything in terms of business and cost is a very masculine approach i remember having a conversation with yvette coopers adviser in which he was asking how much we would save from liberating women who had been trafficked i had to admit that it would actually cost the government more for a woman not to be in prostitution but ultimately these are your citizens theresa may at the home office has been looking at gangs and girls and asking these questions from a female perspective we could argue this forever whether a way of looking at things beyond how much does it cost was an inherently female skill and it was just bad luck that a fair proportion of women never master it or whether conversely this goes across both genders some of the new intake on the labour benches is very inspiring naz shah who beat george galloway with a campaign that was about as human as any i have ever seen is going to make an inspiring mp for bradford west even if the party spends another five years trying to work out what its objection to the conservative party actually is i believe shah will use her membership as she has used her political activism in the past to prove that nothing is insurmountable catherine west who beat lynne featherstone in the red wedding of the lib dems election creates a completely different atmosphere but its also one of infinite possibility her commitment to fair wages and the barriers she will chip away to achieve them are fascinating to hear rupa huq who was manhandled by a conservative party minder while out on the trail took angie brays ealing seat though those events may not have been related creative and intellectual she is extremely interesting in race and culture i anticipate shah being brilliant on violence against women west being great on the fact that low wages while not a female problem nevertheless are particularly hard to shift in femaledominated workforces and huq being a very significant voice in terms of the effect it has on women when racist and othering discourses become normal in debates about migration and asylum thats just a guess i suppose the good thing about the labour party is that it will not one dearly hopes be as united and disciplined as the conservative party but that it will make space for these new voices to speak freely nicola sturgeon wont be in westminster of course but has demonstrated something important that cannot instantly be forgotten that real progressive politics expressed trenchantly and without shame eschewing a concept of the centre ground in favour of values are apparently not as toxic to the modern electorate as was previously thought could you call these values female when you prize structures of social security above profit and efficiency does that necessarily imply a female perspective i wonder which of we women would care but as i said we dont all agree,2015-05,doe woman voter want make parliament element may serve principle policy woman

since its mothers day its worth asking once again whether life is getting any easier for working mothers working mothers indeed all mothers draw a short straw in the united states from the moment their babies draw their first breaths not only do hospitals routinely require them to head home within hours after giving birth in european hospitals mothers and babies can stick around for a few days allowing the new mother to rest and ensuring that there arent any feeding problems but the united states remains one of the only countries in the world that doesnt mandate any kind of paid maternity leave your employer may do so but it isnt a requirement that puts in the company of countries like oh swaziland and papua new guinea a lot of attention is focused on the plight of working professional women sheryl sandberg the facebook coo now dealing with the tragic death of her husband and much praised supporter did much to galvanize the debate on working women with her book lean in but for those who aspire to follow in her footsteps all the way to the top there are some uncomfortable truths colleges have studied their alumni and puzzled over the fact that even though half of their graduating seniors may be women a much smaller percentage end up in senior leadership positions do their priorities change when they have children do they encounter workplaces that are hostile to them the numbers certainly suggest that something is amiss women may hold of professional jobs but they occupy only of all ceo positions and less than of fortune ceo jobs they account for only of all top earners in the country they are of law firm associates but only of law firm partners only of senior management positions at startups at silicon valley are filled by women even one of the more progressive of the silicon valley venture capital firms andreesen horowitz whose top performers are women doesnt have any female partners some of the reasons for this boil down to outright gender bias on the part of institutions and individuals that affect all women many disproportionately affect working mothers already torn between two sets of responsibilities increasingly the evidence suggests that it isnt just that men work harder or even that they put in more time one recent study even suggests that many of those men actually may have been faking working hours a week sadly some of the organizations that offer little in the way of worklife flexibility or that have relatively few female leaders are those now being run by women or with women in senior roles women who get to the top the marissa mayers yahoos ceo and sheryl sandbergs seem to be those who have put their careers first and now expect others to do the same says eileen gunn mother of a sevenyearold daughter and founder of familiesgo an online media company focused on family travel gunn works from home people who are in a position to make systemic changes arent doing so mayer after becoming ceo of yahoo hit the headlines for banning employees from working at home a big perk for working mothers as a result of these headwinds many of those working mothers who should have risen to the top like annemarie slaughter who rose to become the first woman of policy planning at the state department ended up bowing out concluding that it was impossible to have it all many working mothers i know would agree with at least some of the issues that slaughter raised in her celebrated essay for the atlantic alice finn who has a collegeaged daughter and whose son is in high school says that being a working mother forced her to make strategic career choices i was the first generation to be forewarned about the tradeoffs she said but i knew i wanted to be able to spend time with my children so finn opted to leave behind her first career in law and do something that she could be passionate about and that would give her the flexibility she sought working as a financial advisor if women are savvy about the career they choose they can employ technology to their advantage and make being a working mother a bit easier finn added generally speaking she said being an entrepreneur is easier than working within a large corporation still working with a corporation can be fine too if youve got a built in support system as courtney higham does at her new york human resources outsourcing company her company gives her the ability to step away from work to take her yearold son theo to doctors appointments and to work from home i also work with a lot of women and with that comes the empathy of being in the same boat she said we all work to cover each other when we need to we are a workingmom community still higham says that generally corporate america still is falling down on the job when it comes to recognizing what working mothers accomplish men get pats on the back for taking their kids to the doctor and when a woman needs to do so it is thought of as a hassle she says employers should want a wellrounded person working for them who has a happy and balanced life a single mother working for a west coast university ended up having to make a dramatic career change in order to have the stability she needed to raise her daughter now years old the pay was less but i can leave at the end of the day and be home with her she says its not easy i cut my expenses to the bone there is no cable television but i have marketable skills the people that i suspect have it far worse are those working mothers without those skills indeed michelle budig a professor at the university of massachusettsamherst studied the impact that becoming a parent had on earnings fatherhood it turns out was a bonus a mans earnings rise by when he becomes a dad motherhood on the other hand takes a toll on womens earning power the average figure was that for each child a woman bears her earning power falls by but that this decline isnt evenly distributed the lower a womans income the greater the size of the drop in earnings after she becomes a working mother while at the very top sheryl sandbergs demographic theres no income gap at all so is life getting any easier for working mothers well its tougher for companies to discriminate overtly against them an entirely new area of law is emerging devoted to just this kind of bias and if youre sheryl sandberg with brains connections willpower and money then the world is your oyster even if it doesnt feel that way to her right now but for the vast majority of working mothers most victories may feel small when measured against the ongoing juggling act keeping increasingly demanding employers happy dealing with subtle and notsosubtle conflicts with colleagues and stayat home mothers who judge their decisions and all the while trying to raise happy and healthy offspring really its enough to make one wonder why theyre only entitled to a single special day a year,2015-05,since mother day worth asking whether life getting easier working

the new house of commons will be more diverse than ever before with more women and more minorityethnic mps than in any previous parliament while the undisputed single biggest shift in the new intake is the dramatic increase in scottish national party mps at westminster equality campaigners are celebrating record numbers of women with almost one in three mps now female the results have also returned a parliament with slightly fewer mps who have been to feepaying schools or oxford or cambridge universities more female mps after the election women make up of the new intake up from in thanks largely to labour whose new mps make up of labours share helped too by the snp intake of whom more than a third are women however there is now not one single female liberal democrat mp the uk also still compares unfavourably with swedens parliament which is female and sets a gold standard for gender equality the uk also lags behind many other countries including belgium iceland argentina and burundi the fawcett society which campaigns for gender equality welcomed the increase in womens representation the chair belinda phipps said we are really pleased that there has been an increase albeit a small increase in women mps in the house of commons we know that when women are part of the legislative and decisionmaking process better decisions are made we particularly welcome the fact that the parties are turning to women to lead the way with two new party leaders in harriet harman for labour and suzanne evans for ukip together with nicola sturgeon and natalie bennett that makes women a formidable force in the new political world among the women who won seats was naz shah a mental health campaigner who took bradford west for labour from respects george galloway after a bitter campaign battle which included claims and counterclaims about her teenage marriage in pakistan andrea jenkyns a former music teacher and amateur opera singer was a highprofile winner for the

mps is yearold mhairi black a snp glasgow university student who won paisley and renfrewshire south from the shadow foreign secretary douglas alexander and becomes the youngest mp since more black and minorityethnic mps it was a good night too for campaigners working to build black and minorityethnic representation in westminster drawing on data from the uclbirkbeck parliamentary candidates uk project nonwhite mps now make up more than of the new parliament up from in a increase ucl and birkbeck have been gathering extensive data on parliamentary candidates for two years and will publish the full results later in the year their research does not however include northern ireland ucl estimates that minorityethnic mps will now sit in the commons building on the success of the election when nonwhite mps won seats in westminster among them will be the first mp of chinese origin alan mak who won havant for the tories simon woolley director of operation black vote which ran a highprofile campaign featuring prominent black british stars with white faces welcomed the progress made but added although this is encouraging and a positive development its simply not good enough in terms of composition of parliament the only way we can address this in the short and medium term is to have a comprehensive programme of recruitment retention and promotion of black political talent he said otherwise we will always have to play catchup fewer privately educated mps the educational background of the new intake suggests a very slight shift away from privately and oxbridgeeducated mps who have long dominated westminster towards a greater diversity though equality and social mobility campaigners will argue that it is nowhere near enough ucl data about the education of of the new mps shows that of these went to private schools compared with just of the general population this is progress in more than half of tory mps were privately educated but that figure has fallen to a still strikingly high among labour mps in the intake who went to a feepaying school dropped from in the last election to the charmed surroundings of oxbridge however continue to be a common experience for many of the new intake of the winning candidates who according to ucl research went to university went to either oxford or cambridge university after the last election of all tory mps and of labour had been to oxbridge the age profile of those taking up seats in the house of commons is pretty much unchanged at about according to ucl that however may be revised downwards as many of those whose ages are currently unknown will be snp politicians who are likely to be younger many of the new snp intake are women with impressive hinterlands jo cherry a highly regarded qc spent time as one of scotlands first specialist sex crimes prosecutors and the multifaceted tasmina ahmedsheikh is a lawyer businesswoman and a popular screen actor on the asian subcontinent in glasgow the magnificent seven as the citys new snp mps were dubbed by nicola sturgeon include several stalwart campaigners such as alison thewliss anne mclaughlin and natalie mcgarry the latter was a leading light in women for independence a nonaligned group credited with radicalising women across scotland during last years independence campaign all these changes will undoubtedly alter the character of the commons when the new intake take up their seats and the old guard move out philippa whitford who joins other snp mps in westminster the vast majority of them firsttimers was interviewed by the guardian when she first announced her candidacy and made a prescient comment what strikes me is that if we pull it off this is going to be the most nonpolitical group of politicians westminster has seen for a long time were a bunch of mavericks jennifer hudson coauthor of the uclbirkbeck parliamentary candidates uk project said the parties efforts in increasing the number of women candidates selected has paid off there are now more women mps in parliament than ever before importantly it is by selecting and placing women candidates in their winnablemarginal constituencies that we see numbers like we do today the increase in bme black and minorityethnic communities representation from in is also notable the tories led the way with of candidates selected from nonwhite backgrounds but it is by placing bme

its but my interviewer wanted to know how id juggle work and motherhood i recently had an interview at a wellrespected commercial organisation i have ample relevant experience for the position and felt that the interview was going well during the section where i was asked technical questions gave a presentation and had to answer questions related to my field of work i was interviewed by two men i am female i was asked by one of them how i would cope with the work bearing in mind i have two children i had disclosed this in my application form only to explain a short gap in my career i was stunned to be asked this in and while i wanted to challenge them by asking whether they were putting the same question to male candidates i answered along the lines of fine obviously or i would not have applied for this position as i am not stupid and have worked since my children were small the interview continued and it was made clear that successful candidates would be chosen largely on whether they would fit in with the organisation and other staff i have yet to hear whether or not i have been successful leaving aside the issue of whether i want to work for an organisation that asks such questions in interviews i am not sure whether and how to raise the issue with the company if i am unsuccessful i do not want to appear that i am acting out of sour grapes but i feel very angry that i was asked such a question when i suspect male candidates would not have been i feel that future female candidates should not be put in such a position and this large organisation should know better than to interview in such a way how do i and should i raise this issue with the organisation in question jeremy says i have every sympathy for your feelings and understand your reaction but im afraid i am not going to agree with the intensity of your response you may think that this is because i too am a man and you may be right but i hope youll at least give some openminded thought to my reply at a cool factual level it is indisputably the case that when women are carrying the majority duties of bringing up young children they need to be more inventive than their male partners in programming their various work and home responsibilities and when a childs illness or demands from school intervene it is often the mother rather than the father who chooses or is chosen to do the necessary juggling which may well have a brief impact on her timekeeping most are skilled at covering or working late and take pride in ensuring that the impact on work is minimal this allocation of responsibilities between parents may be unfair and may well be unnecessary but its certainly not uncommon the male interviewer who asked you how you would cope bearing in mind that you had two children was certainly guilty of clumsiness and insensitivity but to his not very empathetic mind he was simply acknowledging an understood reality and wanting to know how you managed it in that respect i honestly dont see that there was anything inherently offensive about his question i think your immediate reaction was a bit extreme and i fear this reaction may have disproportionately coloured your view of the entire company whether or not youre offered this job and lets hope you are i suggest you write a measured letter to your main contact there explain the reasons for your writing though more temperately than in your letter to me simply and helpfully suggest that such a question however tactfully phrased could well deter excellent female candidates from wanting to join even if you dont get the job that wont sound like sour grapes readers say i have a friend who was asked this in an interview for promotion in the civil service she complained and the questioner was disciplined in the private sector where i work anything goes that doesnt mean you shouldnt challenge it though i would make the complaint daenelle id keep my big mouth shut and allow for the possibility that i was making more out of this than was actually the case if i were on the other side of the table and recognised you from your letter i would prefer not to hire you on the grounds that you are so angry about this how do you plan to work with these colleagues in future if you start by complaining about them aranzazu i would wait for the decision but youre quite right it was unacceptable and needs to be flagged with the organisation whether you get the job or not loun i would have asked if they had any children and how they have coped with it isullivan should i risk missing out on a dream job by admitting that im scared of flying im in work and am interviewing for a dream role at the headquarters of an international company that has offices all around the world the problem is i have a fear of flying in the past this has lost me several other roles even though you could argue there really wasnt much of a need to travel the job specification has no mention of a requirement to travel i imagine it may be useful to visit the other offices as part of the role but not essential what should i do be upfront and risk not getting the job again or say nothing and risk losing it once i start jeremy says since no mention is made in the job spec of a requirement to travel i see no point in your volunteering the fact that you have a serious fear of flying but i say this on one condition there are almost no worthwhile jobs these days that wont occasionally call for people to travel and unless its to somewhere within easy reach of eurostar that means flying so i think its high time you determined to rid yourself of this horrible but curable phobia i have had several letters in the past from people who have surprised themselves by the success of various courses or methodologies on offer google fear of flying and youll have a days worth of suggestions to wade through some strictly commercial some free some based on published articles and some no doubt dodgy but the overall success rate seems to be reassuringly high you should go for it before your first overseas assignment crops up readers say dont say anything get help pay for a cognitive behavioural therapy course and dont be afraid to use some pills your body has latched on to flying as a trigger for fear and flight flooding you with adrenaline at the idea of entering that tube beta blockers can put a floor under this and once you realise youre not going to die you will recover take the job and then pay for help realise its just your body playing tricks on you teach it whos boss speakman i havent been in one of those crashprone flying cigar tubes for years and it suits me just fine flatulentus just sign up with a recruitment agency in the various cities and then get someone

meryltocracy it appears meryl streep has gone full method for her latest role as emmeline pankhurst in upcoming movie suffragette this week deciding to write a letter to every single member of congress thats letters imploring them to revive the equal rights amendement era which would prohibit discrimination against women and girls under the law written in shortly after women in the us got the vote the amendment was passed by congress in but never gained the ratification needed to enter the constitution and despite several attempts to resurrect it it has not been touched since however if streep can wield the kind of power over congress that taylor swift arguably can over apple then maybe thats all set to change streeps letter reads i am writing to ask you to stand up for equality for your mother your daughter your sister your wife or yourself by actively supporting the equal rights amendment the actor who won an oscar for her portrayal of margaret thatcher in the iron lady was seen doing a sort of fistpump at this years academy awards as patricia arquette made her speech about feminism a whole new generation of women and girls are talking about equality equal pay equal protection from sexual assault equal rights continues the letter streep who recently funded a writing lab for women over also included a copy of the book equal means equal by era coalition president jessica neuwirth with every letter and it appears the actress has one supporter at least in california congresswoman and democrat jackie speier who said the time is ripe to ratify the equal rights amendment seventy percent of people polled think that we already have an era in the constitution and theyre shocked to find we dont have one if anyone can pull this off surely its meryl and surely shell get more than a little help from friends maybe geena davis for one who we hattip this week for her plans for a new global drive to address gender imbalance in the movie world feminism sells its not often that adverts are praised for their positive representation of gender but at the cannes lion international festival of creativity this week a host of inspiring ads from around the world received critical acclaim for their treatment of women in fact there were a total of adverts all vying to win awards in the inaugural glass lion category which has been created specifically to honour ad campaigns that challenge gender stereotypes and prejudices some of the adverts nominated are fascinating if only to catch a glimpse into the daily lives of women of other nationalities and the different often subtle forms of repression they are subjected to because of their gender take un womens give mom back her name advert which encouraged men in egypt where it is taboo for sons to reveal their mothers name to change their names on their social media profiles to that of their mothers in time for mothers day and then theres the grand prixwinning advert indias touch a pickle campaign for a sanitary towel brand which seeks to dispel the myth that women who are menstruating cant touch pickles who knew sport england picked up a gong for its this girl can campaign as did the very successful like a girl advert from the us which has racked up over m views on youtube since launching a year ago although these adverts all focus on women and challenging a female gender bias cindy gallop the glass lions jury president is keen that the award encourages the advertising industry to create campaigns that are much more reflective of the world around us with that in mind gallop hopes that the glass lion is not an award that will still be needed in the near future i would like to see the glass lion not need to exist in a few years time i would like in a few years time for every canneswinning award to be doing what the glass lion is designed to celebrate its certainly a nice idea imagine a world where there are no adverts of women eating fatfree yoghurts or women in corsets supposedly advertising real ale but when brands like femfresh still cant face using the word vagina in their adverts preferring the word it instead the realisation of gallops vision looks to be a way off yet laying the foundation if youre confused as to why thousands of instagrammers are posting photos of only one half of the their face made up and the other half makeup free then allow us to introduce you to this weeks hashtag thepowerofmakeup wellknown dutch beauty blogger nikki of nikki tutorials started the trend last week when she created a video showing her face with makeup on just one side in response to makeup shamers a new breed of internet troll who accuse people of wearing makeup to hide their insecurities since then young women around the world have been inspired by nikkis halfandhalf face copying her video in a bid to tell the world that their use of makeup is an expression of creativity rather than a tool to hide flaws and impress men whatever your view on the motive behind the trend or on the politics of eyeliner one thing cant be denied the ability makeup possesses to transform a face is powerful indeed who you gonna call the shewolf of wall street hot on the

corruption and yes some sexism you have been warned marvellous medicine at the end of there was a flurry of excitement surrounding a breakthrough in the male pill with the discovery of proteins that are able to control the movement of sperm however much of that excitement appeared to have come from women eager to share the contraception burden rather than from men giddy at the idea of being able to take the pill but according to a survey in the telegraph this week as part of its take back contraception campaign over men allegedly cant wait to get their hands on the pill should it become available over half of the men surveyed were strongly for the male pill with the remainder split between the im not sure and the no id rather not camps given that the poll doesnt appear to discriminate between male and female voters this female writer voted twice it cant really be deemed wholly representative of the male mindset however with several forms of male contraception currently undergoing clinical trials alongside two nonhormonal pills a contraceptive injection is being tested which are slated to be available in the next few years perhaps there really is a surge in interest and willing on the other hand the same paper tells us that prototypes for the male pill have been being made since the s and none of them have made it into production it looks like we might still have

as a working mother of two young children of course i inwardly cheered as i read the headlines this week it turns out that despite the grim daily warnings from the daily mail and the nagging guilty voice inside my head the children of women who work do very nicely indeed thank you that is indeed happy news so why did i also experience a kind of sinking feeling it became clearer to me as i read on and encountered the spin that was going to be put upon these findings rather than women feeling empowered to make their own choices apparently it is now those who stay at home who should be feeling guilty rebecca allen a senior academic at ucls institute of education said that the study should be a read as a signal to women who dont work that they have to think hard about how the role they have within the household is going to impact their childrens perceptions of what it means to be a woman and to be a mother i am as tired as the next woman of the rightwing press telling me that i should spend my life painting my nails and cleaning the kitchen quite apart from being generally tired which i am constantly but i also feel that something is missing from the debate in more enlightened circles we social progressives tend not to say clearly loudly or often enough that the mothers and fathers who prioritise staying at home and caring for their families are a valuable and grossly undervalued asset to society rather than focusing solely on pushing women out to work putting them under evergreater obligation to feed the capitalist machine we should be making space for them and their partners to enjoy a stable and happy family life nothing could be more important economic and social factors are piling the pressure on to women of my age whereas once a single fulltime income would have been enough to buy a house now any family without a high double income and parental help doesnt stand a chance this arrangement assumes that caring for children is a little hobby something we can all do in our spare time this is so far from the truth it is laughable whereas once our partners might have counted on a living wage and a job for life they are now being made redundant or working zerohours contracts my mumfriends and i dont only worry about our career paths indeed blearyeyed with sleep deprivation that is often the last thing on our minds we worry about paying the mortgage or the rent constantly is that healthy for our children is it healthy for us as i schlepped daily into work in central london eight months pregnant constantly nauseous and with a twoyearold at home it didnt feel that way if we look to the feminist movement for support and guidance dealing with this insane situation we are sorely disappointed the debate seems to focus entirely on womens status in the public sphere how much they are earning how many of them sit in boardrooms any mention of children and childcare responsibilities is always and only in reference to improving access to institutionalised childcare these debates leave me and many other otherwise progressive mothers i know completely cold we dont want our children to spend their tender years in an institution we dont care about moneygrabbing hardnosed capitalists be they male or female we care about our children and wed like to see them a little more often,2015-06,working mother two young child course inwardly

stop feeling guilty thats the rough takehome message or perhaps more precisely the message many working parents will choose to take home from a new harvard study which found that the daughters of working mothers go on to have more successful careers and more equal relationships something many women have long hoped was true that going out to work provides a strong role model for your daughters now has a little more evidence to back it up and in this season of forgetting to bake cakes for the school fete and scrabbling for soldout summer holiday childcare its just nice to have the moral high ground for once how liberating to be told that were not ruining our kids lives by daring to pay the bills that a career isnt necessarily something you buy at the expense of the people you love that you neednt drag the clanking chains of guilt along behind you for ever and that essentially is also the seductive promise behind the latest hot parenting book by the american time management guru laura vanderkam i know how she does it the author promises less to change your life than to stop you feeling quite so bad about it having persuaded numerous overachieving women to keep time logs of their days from dawn gym workouts nope me neither to solving work crises at midnight she observes that actually their lives didnt look that bad busy yes but full and rewarding our cultures doomladen focus on the tough bits risks obscuring a bigger truth about working parenthood she argues which is that it makes many women feel very fulfilled if stressed her book may not resonate quite so much its fair to say with those very many women feeling knackered and guiltridden while doing jobs they dont much enjoy for less than the sixfigure salaries of the women in her book but the more accessible british version is probably the argument made by the labour frontbencher lucy powell last year that working mothers should be publicly proud of how much they do rather than apologising for it that unmistakably chimed with mothers who privately felt pretty comfortable about their working lives but didnt dare say so because they worried that if they werent wracked with selfloathing then they were probably doing it wrong its faintly mad obviously to make anyone feel guilty about not feeling sufficiently guilty yet there is a tendency for brisk cando accounts such as vanderkams to skip a bit too quickly over the question of whether guilt is always necessarily bad of what makes a good life for children as well as for parents cards on the table in the last fortnight alone ive felt guilty more times than i can remember there was the time i packed my son off to school when he was feeling distinctly under the weather because i needed to be away for work the ongoing guilt about not doing more to support an old friend whose father is seriously ill because there never seems to be time to carve out an hour for a proper uninterrupted conversation the faint but perpetual guilt that the house is a mess and that the dog now pointedly brings its lead to any stranger who comes to the door in the manner of a dog that needs more walking and then theres the saturday spent chairing a labour leadership hustings feeling simultaneously guilty about not being home doing something fun with my son guilty about leaving my husband with a days solo parenting but also guilty about all the other outofhours gigs the thinktank breakfasts evening drinks weekends at party conferences ive turned down on family grounds even at the risk of drifting that bit further out of the professional loop the trouble with contemporary parental guilt is that its as much about work as it is about the children to stay at home is to feel bad about wasting your education about dodging your responsibility to contribute either financially at home or publicly to the world and now about whether it will hold your own daughter back fulltime motherhood has moved from middleclass norm to niche choice that requires defending and as a result every government pledge of free childcare or official report highlighting as the european council did this week how rising maternal employment boosts gdp becomes a cattle prod to the conscience parttimers meanwhile are envied for having one foot in the playground and one in the office but worry secretly about failing to keep up with either of them skidding late into the school pickup still furtively sending emails on our phones ive worked variously fulltime parttime and very briefly barely at all and the truth is that some of those lives were more enjoyable than others but none was guiltfree time spent envying or resenting other parents is usually time wasted vanderkam has a point that wallowing in guilt over every little thing can be exhausting selflimiting and even selfindulgent taking things to martyred extremes is sometimes more about showing what a saintly person you must be so selfsacrificing so concerned for others than about organising family life well but wanting to be entirely free of guilt of that horrible mental tickertape running through your head that seems neither possible nor to be honest all that desirable guilt stems after all from a feeling of obligation a sense that there was something you should have done but didnt and its this sense that basically makes us social animals guilt helps us keep numerous complex relationships going by prodding us to observe the correct mutual obligations for each indeed you could argue its essential to a full and interesting life since it helps us keep track of whats owed when and to whom at its worst guilt can obviously be a mechanism for repression particularly when used for political or religious ends but at its best guilt is the emotional equivalent of physical pain a warning sign that somethings overloaded some unseen damage is being done the genuinely contented working mother is of course probably the one who can distinguish this useful guilt from the toxic kind that results from failing at some pointless imaginary or unreasonable duty and no before you ask i dont really know how she does that but hey at least thats something new to feel guilty

working mothers are good for their children says a harvard business school study data from countries suggests that the daughters of working mothers have better careers higher pay and more equal relationships than those whose mothers stayed at home whats more their sons thrive too and grow up to be better men more involved at home taking more time caring for their own family than men who grew up cosseted by stayathome mothers will this at last relieve the guilt and anxiety working women feel probably not a lot since combining work and children is so unbearably fraught for so many mothers and society still so badly adapted i did it and now i relive it by seeing my daughters do it though i also remember them when small and in a bad mood crossly muttering that theyd stay at home for their children all children know how to play on a working mothers guilt childcare is phenomenally expensive even when the government increases it to a free hours for three and four yearolds the crises in holidays half terms inset days polling days or child sickness days cause perpetual panics school plays school trips parent meetings all the things that should be pleasures are too often problems labour had started creating extended schools with breakfast and afterschool clubs support for the deprived and vital childcare provision for working mothers but many have closed the harvard report finds the uk and us harsher than the rest of the eu on working conditions for mothers will this finally lay to rest the barrage of assaults on working mothers from the likes of the daily mail and daily telegraph of course not for them women are always in the wrong either they are career obsessives who neglect their children to pursue ambition or if they stay at home theyre either lazy benefit scroungers or rich idle yummy mummies leaving children with nannies while they take spa days just check the press archives and see the stream of guiltinducing headlines suggesting working mothers do irreparable damage to their children stayathome mothers have the most worthwhile lives reports the telegraph decline of the stayathome mother bemoans the mail plus this heres absolute proof mothers are better off staying at home from their columnist peter hitchens he writes one familyfriendly policy is taxpayer subsidies for the network of day orphanages where abandoned children are detained without trial for long hours while their mothers are chained to desks miles away dont expect the mail and telegraph yearning for a return to a fantasy s to end any time soon what would it take to send mothers home a housing market everyone could afford where one average wage would cover the rent or mortgage without the family starving fathers average pay would need to rise by about to compensate if not tax credits and benefits for stayathome mothers would need to rise by about that sum but the government is axing them divorce would be banned as one in three mothers will at some point find themselves separated and left as the main breadwinner for their children the new marriage tax allowance is supposed to provide the necessary marital glue but at a year thats magical policymaking stayathome mothers who have to return to work once theyve lost their career status find nothing but lowpaid lowstatus zerohours or mock selfemployed agency jobs await at the beck and call of employers impossible to mould around schoolgate times heres the irony when universal credit comes in it will be far harder for women to work as the family credits will fall for every pound they earn wheres the sense in that the mail didnt cover this groundbreaking harvard report instead they ran this story outdazzled by our daughters three mothers candidly talk about their looks fading as their teenage

the labour deputy leadership candidate angela eagle has called for the party to be bolder in pushing people from diverse backgrounds into prominent and powerful posts eagle who became britains first openly gay female mp when she came out in said labour had often made principled yet unpopular decisions to improve the lives of women people from ethnic minorities and the lgbt community only to see the conservatives grab the glory once public opinion had shifted her comments will be seen as a way of forcing the issues of diversity and representation into the deputy leadership race she is one of three female candidates for the role and is the only out lesbian eagle said labour should grab back the agenda of minority rights and that her election would help smash the glass ceiling for lgbt people diversity is an important part of what the labour party stands for but it is obvious that we do not always get the credit for the work that we do people talk about margaret thatcher being the first female prime minister but we could easily have had a first female prime minister in barbara castle and there is a pattern we as a party have laid much of the groundwork on womens issues on lgbt issues and on the representation of bame people we have forced through laws which were unpopular at the time and made stands on principle because we believed in them eagle welcomed david camerons decision to argue in favour of gay marriage but said it was labour that stuck to its principles before lgbt rights were widely acknowledged we came into government in with an agenda of lgbt rights we did all the heavy lifting when it wasnt popular when we repealed section in there were few tories who agreed with us we should be bolder about speaking about our success on these issues and pushing people from more diverse backgrounds into influential positions i hope i demonstrate by example that it is important eagle the mp for wallasey said she would welcome an influx of lgbt supporters or their financial support as part of her campaign to become deputy leader i would always encourage people to join the party if a quarter of a million lgbt people get involved that would be good eagle was one of the youngest mps in parliament when she was first elected in at the age of since then she has been a minister and shadow minister in four different departments been the vicechair of the parliamentary labour party and chaired party conference labours national executive committee and its national policy forum she has been at the forefront of the argument for quotas within the party and scored notable successes when tackling the tories from the floor of the house after challenging the prime minister over nhs reforms he was roundly criticised for telling her to calm down dear her decision to stand as deputy leader has been welcomed by many old hands within the party who believe she has managed the tony blair gordon brown and ed miliband regimes with humour and loyalty eagle expressed her regret at the partys failure to put forward a single bame candidate in the current leadership and deputy leadership campaigns chuka umunna the shadow business secretary pulled out of the leadership contest within days of announcing that he was going to run citing personal reasons and the unexpected level of media attention rushanara ali dropped out of the deputy leadership campaign last week after it became clear that there were too many candidates for each to achieve the votes needed from mps eagle said the partys rules may need to be reexamined if it is to bring in more candidates from different backgrounds it is unfortunate that we have no one from a bame background in either election things are changing in the party but not fast enough rushanara did a very selfless thing she wanted to open up a narrow choice and so she stepped down it became narrow because each candidate needed so many nominations from mps we may need to look at the voting system again stella

when his elder daughter entered first grade gary clarke signed up to be a class parent organizing and participating in all kinds of special events in her classroom and being a liaison between the teacher and other parents the catch for an entire term clarke a stayathome dad in massachusetts who for the last years has been the primary caregiver for his and his wifes two daughters was known as the class mom i thought really we couldnt just call this class parent but no recalls clarke and that wasnt the only jarring experience all the playgroups were called mommy and me he recalls at first the mothers were flustered talking to him about arranging playdates or having him join the playground groups but says clarke today i understood why and it really didnt bother me that much when something is a novelty its ok for other people to be uncomfortable about it the novelty may be wearing off the number of dads who are opting to stay home to raise their children leaving their wives to take the role as the familys primary breadwinner is growing the pew research center reports that this figure has roughly doubled since to more than million american men while rising unemployment rates since the financial crisis of and the recession that followed have played a role the research finds that fathers now account for of all stayathome parents up from in to be sure women still face hurdles challenging ageold assumptions about their proper role in life and these affect their ability to earn the same wages that their male colleagues do earn promotions and rise to the top in their professions but men point out that if they take on those same assumptions they combat just as many stereotypes and hurdles whether its being labeled a class mom or finding that potential employers and recruiters put big obstacles in front of them when they want to reenter the workforce and public attitudes dont help the pew study found that only of respondents believed a family is better off with a father who stays home and doesnt work while believed a family will fare better with a mother at home caring for the children some men point out that the problem is that too many people and entities still view worklife balance issues as belonging to women alone rather than to all parents the reality is that when men do engage in those issues they often are treated as hostile interlopers one such father who takes the lead at home wrote to me after my mothers day column on working women ran last month he pointed out that men too end up getting paid less because they take jobs that are close to home with more flexibility they are less likely to be considered for promotions and encounter the same kind of glass ceiling that working mothers do they pull the same kind of second shift duty that their female counterparts do steef vandegevel has encountered some of those workplace experiences during his brief forays into the workplace while primarily being a stayathome dad in brooklyn caring for two sons aged six and originally an audio engineer for a brief while he took another kind of job that required him to be in a workplace for what amounted to nearly a conventional working day i had to rush out the door at pm every day to pick up my son at school though and i was the only one to leave early he says it was too difficult for me and my boss vandegevel ended up leaving that job these days his family lives on his wifes income running workforce development programs at a nonprofit organization and on airbnb income from the floor in the home the family bought years ago and rent out on a regular basis we can make it work he says for many stayathome dads the big challenge will come when they try to reenter the workforce clarke tried once to move back into engineering when his elder daughter was getting ready to go to kindergarten potential employers aware that the gap on his cv was due to the fact that he had been her primary caregiver peppered him with questions about what would happen if she became sick and had to stay out of school who would miss work to care for her he or his wife i was fairly sure that these questions werent legal but this was definitely an area of concern and it was also fairly clear what the answer would be clarke says fortunately i didnt need to follow through as our second daughter arrived and i stayed home with her now hes making a move into teaching as an alternate career ive been out of engineering for so long that i fell behind and in teaching ill be on the same schedule that they will be he says he has applied for a job as a seventh grade math teacher and is waiting to hear whether hell be appointed to fill a vacancy that has just appeared at a local school district vandegevel too thinks hell have to abandon his original career audio engineering but hasnt yet figured out what will come next i was an art student and im pretty handy with construction it would have to be something that i would start myself probably neither man regrets their choice to stay home to raise their children in spite of the disruptions to their career or any financial stress it might have caused even if it has meant joining mommy and me groups but both acknowledge that they still are part of a minority guys go through the same prejudices that women encounter in a different way says clarke i just decided when somebody made fun of the situation to counteract it i would simply own it i wasnt going to let it be that big a deal but what isnt a big deal for one individual can end up becoming a bigger deal for a society at some point we all may do well to take a step back and stop thinking of parenthood and worklife issues strictly in gender terms instead of focusing on the fact that theres a fatherhood bonus and a motherhood penalty we can concentrate on the reality that whichever parent ends up caring for the children will suffer some kind of penalty its not going to be gender specific even if the fact that most stayathome parents are women means that most people affected by this today are women in fact the pew study on single fathers noted that the proportion of stayathome fathers who are living in poverty is actually higher than the proportion of stayathome mothers living in poverty consider how norway handles this distributing parental leave equally between both mother and father and giving men and women the rights to leave their offices early enough to spend time with their families the right to adjust their hours to accommodate pickup and dropoff hours at their local daycare and help with housework the emphasis isnt on either men or women but on parents in the meantime to all those who buck societys unwritten expectations and opt to push the strollers spoon out the pured vegetables and yes volunteer

if nothing else the furore over sir tim hunts remarks in seoul to a lunch of women journalists has shone a laser beam on the lot of women in science i hope this illumination can stimulate widespread action in institutions across the world eradicating some of the many manifest inequities women all too often face opinions have varied on just how unacceptable hunts remarks were or how much latitude should be allowed because they were a failed attempt at humour in an offthecuff brief speech of welcome on saturday eight nobelwinning scientists criticised the summary dismissal of hunt by university college london nevertheless for many though not for me he is likely to remain the exemplar for all that is bad about the sexist culture that is still endemic in science as across the whole of our society but my interest now is in the future how can we use the momentum gathered by the very public debate to make a positive change just one action for women in science justactionwis is my call to action asking individuals within science and beyond to come up with ideas to help this is motivated by the hope that a real change in our perceptions and support for young girls and adult women in the broad domain of science can blossom from the current mess on my blog earlier in the week i offered some notions of my own these ranged from call out bad behaviour whenever and wherever you see it to refuse to serve on singlesex panels the treatment many female researchers have endured at the hands sometimes literally of senior men is one reason why hunts remarks have been received with such horror there is absolutely no doubt that women across society are far too often demeaned and harassed as laura batess wonderful everyday sexism initiative has made abundantly clear the effects of sexism are however often more subtle problems such as unconscious bias in which both men and women unconsciously mark down female applicants for a job relative to a man with the same qualifications are becoming more widely recognised if not yet eradicated dumping necessary but unvalued chores on to the women and thereby freeing up the men to do the tasks that are more likely to lead to successful career progression is one example of why the playing field can be so uneven and what about the double standard of considering women who miss meetings because of caring responsibilities as not serious while viewing men who do the same as little short of heroic such double standards are many and various but also often invisible without careful inspection they are certainly not unique to science so we need to do better my call for action with an explicit list of suggestions is meant to highlight the kinds of things all of us can do by signing up to the idea i hope people will become much more aware of what they can do to make a real difference to individual women and to the environment in which they work i have been heartened by the generally enthusiastic way my list has been received others have added their suggestions or publicly stated what their pledge will be i particularly liked the suggestion one tweeter made challenging google to update its photo gallery so that typing in professor led to images of women in the first few that appeared if you think that doesnt matter imagine you are a yearold girl trying to get a sense of what the adult professional world is like if the only images that appear against the search term of professor are either elderly white males or cartoons of men in white coats with stickingup hair as a girl you are hardly likely to think it is the sort of career aspiration you should be considering images and role models matter on walls around labs and classrooms we should go beyond the cliched image of marie curie struggling in inadequate dark corners and find current images of women why not use the distractinglysexy photographs that have caused a rare moment of lightness in the hunt saga to intersperse with the greybeards too often adorning the walls women at university and beyond might wish to pledge to act as role models and mentors for schoolchildren or indeed to anyone just that little bit behind them on the career ladder however attention has been primarily focused on issues in the laboratory and career progression for women i have heard too many stories in the past from women regarding anonymous senior males not hunt i hasten to add patting junior women on the knee or habitually staring inappropriately at parts of their anatomy of women being ignored in meetings or shouted down of equipment mysteriously disappearing or never being made available to the women in the group in such cases it is important that bystanders who become aware of whats going on take the initiative to challenge the perpetrator some of the actions i propose refer to acting on a victims behalf to support them and remove the burden on them of being regarded as someone who complains or whinges let alone ending up in a he saidshe said situation that cant be substantiated more drastic action needs careful consideration and due process rumour is not the same as evidence but even a potential threat to reputation albeit only locally can be a powerful weapon less immediately visible handicapping of women can occur when they dont get appropriate credit for their work their visibility is diminished if they are never sent let alone invited to speak at conferences conference organisers as well as group leaders play a key role here my pledge list identifies actions to ensure women are appropriately nominated and invited for lectures job opportunities committees and panels anne glover the former eu chief scientific adviser responded via twitter if nominatingsuggesting a man for panelmembership etc must also nominate an excellent woman this shouldnt be too difficult it could make an important difference so what can you do whether youre a parent a teacher a researcher or a professor i am convinced there is some action you can take to make a difference and help future generations of women to thrive in science that way we can ensure women fulfil their potential and are able to use their talents fully for the good of us all science is best done by diverse and inclusive groups of people and best done when those doing it recognise each other as individuals who are not just scientists but also people with lives beyond science,2015-06,nothing else furore sir tim hunt remark seoul lunch woman journalist ha shone laser beam lot woman science hope illumination stimulate widespread action institution across

recently an old blackandwhite photo appeared on my twitter feed it showed an effigy of a woman riding a bicycle being dangled out of a secondfloor window while crowds of young men rallied in the street below with it cambridge students were protesting the proposed admission of women to the university in this week is national bike week a chance to celebrate the humble bicycle and among the many reasons to do so perhaps the one most often overlooked is the key role it played in the womens liberation movement to the cambridge protesters a woman on a bicycle represented changing times the first bicyclelike vehicles appeared in the first half of the th century and had developed into something resembling their modern form by the s coinciding with the first wave of feminism they rapidly gained popularity from onwards first for leisure among the upper classes and then as mass production took over as a convenient form of transport for middleclass working men but for women the bicycle boom meant much more opening up a whole new world of independence freed from the watchful eyes of chaperones women were finally provided with an easy escape from the house as well as their first opportunity to develop physical fitness and many of them took cycling up with relish in the british writer louise jeye exclaimed there is a new dawn of emancipation and it is brought about by the cycle free to wheel free to spin out in the glorious country unhampered by chaperones the young girl of today can feel the real independence of herself and while she is building up her better constitution she is developing her better mind guidebooks encouraged women to get out on their bikes such as lady cycling what to wear and how to ride which was republished in full by the british library last year others however were less keen on this development its hard to imagine now how much outrage female cyclists caused when they started appearing on the streets and the consternation existed as much among other women as it did among men canadian journalist kit coleman who later broke barriers by becoming one of the worlds first female war correspondents stated in that no girl over the age of should be allowed to wheel it is immoral unfortunately it is older girls who are ardent wheelers they love to cavort and careen above the spokes twirling and twisting in a manner that must remind them of longdead dancing days in particular the act of straddling the bicycle was viewed as unseemly for women with widespread concern that it might cause sexual arousal a bicycle with both pedals on the same side was developed to allow ladies to ride sidesaddle others had the centre cut out of the saddle to prevent any rubbing that might cause unwanted excitement medical objections were also raised doctors were creative with their diagnoses one writing in claimed cases of women suffering chronic dysentery as a result of cycling but one of the more common concerns was that women might exhaust themselves with too much exercise to the extent that overexertion was a risk it was caused in large part by the ludicrous clothing women were expected to wear while riding corsets and heavy dresses were damaging enough on a daytoday basis but exercising in them was near impossible the adoption of more practical clothing was fiercely resisted as immodest and unfeminine but womens newfound love of cycling ultimately helped to transform female fashion it sealed the fate of the restrictive corset while bloomers which had been roundly mocked since the s came into their own some cyclists even came up with ingenious designs to convert their skirts into cyclingfriendly wear when needed as a research project led by kat jungnickel of goldsmiths university has shown by the end of the th century bicycles had become symbolically linked to womens suffrage in a way that is often forgotten today and for many women the relationship between freedom and cycling continues in yemen where a combination of fuel shortages and cultural barriers to women cycling has left many unable to get around photographer bushra alfusail launched a campaign last month to encourage women to get out on their bikes and break the taboo the campaign has received a huge amount of attention both positive and negative with conservatives raising the familiar complaint that cycling is immodest for women meanwhile british charity recycle is providing women in various countries across africa with bikes as a safer and quicker mode of transport than walking next time you hop on your bike remember just

last week i started the hashtag distractinglysexy in response to nobel prizewinning scientist tim hunts illadvised comments about men falling in love with overemotional women in laboratories despite claims that the response to hunts comments constituted an online march of the feminist bullies no one who was part of this humorous attempt to highlight the varied and complex work of female scientists called for hunts resignation or hounded him online but that was the way it was framed there were undoubtedly unpleasant people on social media crowing about the mans downfall but as far as i could see the discussion was largely jocular and owing to the fact that many of the female scientists were posting photos under their own names mostly professional the hunt controversy continues to make headlines with boris johnson and brian cox wading in this week as the backlash to the backlash i even heard it said on radio this morning that tim hunt was hounded from his job by a twitterstorm this is patently not the case as jon ronsons excellent book so now youve been publicly shamed deftly illustrates outrage has become the currency of the internet a person can go viral as the result of an illadvised remark and it can leave their real life their career in tatters it is tempting to think this was the case with hunts resignation in actual fact it was clearly embarrassment on the part of the scientific community at his retrograde sexism and that sexism being splashed across the media which led to pressure on him to resign university college london where hunt held a professorship before his resignation and which was the first university to admit women on the same terms as men would have no truck with comments such as hunts no doubt concern about an international pr disaster played a part but anyone who knows anything about the universitys founding principles would have expected this result whether justified or not outrage cases such as hunts so often follow a predictable almost formulaic cycle i have long felt that the mainstream media overestimate the importance of twitter perhaps because it seems to mainly comprise journalists and influential people someone says something illadvised and social media will respond accordingly with some users making jokes or indulging in a gentle ribbing and others being altogether more unpleasant said person will then lose their job or apologise this is when the second outrage wave declaring the first outrage wave to have been disproportionate kicks in like clockwork throughout there is an assumption that social media are some kind of homogeneous entity with news stories presenting tweets as though they are part of a cohesive linear narrative rather than the tangled wordcloud that they actually signify twitter also gives the illusion of reversing the normal power dynamics suddenly powerful people often men and corporations cannot ignore the outraged voices of the rest of the population yet this is an illusion by blaming the downfall of hunt on mobs of internet feminists the media are ascribing them power transforming everyone on social media with feelings about sexism into a dangerous monolith that threatens free speech they must then be criticised and undermined rendering them even less powerful than before lift the emerald curtain however and its just a load of men and women with opinions on stuff in the same way that people have been having opinions on stuff for thousands of years its just that now they are being published im not saying that public shaming hasnt become a problem on the internet it absolutely has but as these stories appear again and again it may be time to ask ourselves who benefits how much money have media organisations often run by powerful men made from social media activity regarding the sexism of other powerful men for instance it has generated headline after headline yet sexism hasnt stopped in voicing their genuine frustrations about sexism women are providing media outlets with clickbait content largely for free and it will continue at least until the media start taking womens stories seriously by hiring them and allowing them to shape the news agenda in more profound ways until then going viral is often our only recourse but ask how much power it really wields and the answer is probably much less than you think,2015-06,last week started

encouraging men to become more involved as fathers is the key to achieving gender equality according to a landmark international study that shows women remain overwhelmingly more responsible for childcare and domestic duties despite their increasing role in paid employment handson fathers also help produce happier and bettereducated offspring as well as gaining significant benefits to their own physical and mental health the inaugural state of the worlds fathers report argues the page report an analysis of almost studies on the subject from every nation for which data is available highlights the continuing gender disparities over childcare and other domestic duties despite now being of formal workforce globally women still spend between two and times longer then men caring for children or older people and there is no country where men and boys share unpaid domestic and care work equally with women and girls a key part of the problem is a lack of official support for involved fatherhood with paid paternity leave either nonexistent or very brief in most counties said the report produced by mencare an international ngo campaigning on fatherhood that has links to groups including promundo and save the children unless men and boys participate equally in unpaid work in the home and unless governments employers and families expect and support this involvement gender equality will not be achieved it argues mens emotional lives and their wellbeing and happiness will continue to be constrained and they and their children will miss out on one of the most significant relationships of their lives the study published to coincide with fathers day this sunday identifies the massive gender imbalance in childcare and other unpaid domestic work as a key element of the problem even across the developed nations of the oecd women undertake an average of twice as much domestic duties as do men with the ratio rising to eight times as much in south africa and times more in india one study cited by the report found that even between and married employed men in industrialised nations including the uk and us contributed on average only an extra six hours a week to domestic chores nowhere did the time spent by men exceed of that of women this disparity helped explain why women earn on average less than men around the globe the report noted father who participate in childcare and other domestic duties tend in turn to bring up boys more likely to accept equality it added while the daughters of men who share domestic chores are more likely to aspire to higherpaying jobs the reports authors call for governments to introduce more ambitious paternity leave entitlements while more than twothirds of fathers say they would happily work less to spend more time with their children of the nations currently giving paternity leave about half offer less than three weeks more generous provision has the potential to transform gender relations the study argues noting uk research that found fathers who took time off after their childrens birth were much more likely to help with duties like night feeds even a year later the report stresses the wider beneficial effects of more paternal involvement saying involved fathers have been shown to boost their childrens cognitive development mental health and social skills men who say they have close connections with their children tend to live longer happier lives and are more productive at work more benefits still occur when fathers are actively involved before their childrens birth the study found with mens presence at antenatal visits being linked with fewer woman dying in childbirth and in more developed nations with better rates of breastfeeding while of men around the world will become a biological father during their lives the authors say the issue of more parental and domestic involvement by men is virtually invisible in public policies and in public discourse nikki van der gaag an academic and author who cowrote the report said the findings were crucial in efforts to boost equality when fathers take on their fair share of the unpaid care work it can alter the nature of the relationships between men and women and children as both fathers and mothers will have more time for their children women are released from some of their double burden and fathers get to experience the joys satisfactions and stresses of caring for their children taking up roles as caregivers also offers men the opportunity to begin to break free from the narrow concepts of manhood and fatherhood providing their sons and daughters with positive role models improved health and development and higher hopes for the future,2015-06,encouraging men become involved father key achieving

youre a sexist no youre a sexist the argument was loud enough to carry up a flight of stairs and reluctantly i went to see what was going on emotions were running too high to ascertain exactly what had started it something to do with football possibly but one thing was clear playground insults have changed since my day the gaggle of eightyearold boys in our kitchen had absolutely no idea what a sexist actually is but theyd certainly grasped that nobody wants to be called one as somewhat more belatedly has sir tim hunt the nobelwinning biochemist has been widely lampooned for suggesting that women are a nuisance in the lab because you fall in love with them they fall in love with you and when you criticise them they cry which is apparently bad for science he was duly put in the stocks of the today programme and sharply criticised by fellow scientists and one imagines endured some sticky moments at the breakfast table given his wife is an eminent professor of immunology yes they met and fell in love in a lab miraculously science has survived this even if hunt was joking when he suggested labs should be singlesex keeping all those minxy lady biochemists in their provocatively buttonedup white coats safely out of sight it was selfevidently the wrong joke to make to an audience of female scientists and science writers not the behaviour expected of an honorary professor at university college london which is proud of being the first university in britain to admit women on equal terms to men so why then does it feel slightly disconcerting that within a day of his remarks being reported hunt was out of a job i dont buy the hysterical foamflecked rubbish about him being bullied out by feminazis although ucls brusque statement on hunts departure suggests his resignation may well have been the outcome it wanted that hardly adds up to men everywhere being silenced by the thought police nor is it conclusive proof that as the comedian jerry seinfeld recently complained political correctness is killing jokes more specifically his jokes including a gag involving the words gay french king scientists of all people shouldnt be surprised to be robustly challenged for extrapolating wildly from a few ropey old anecdotes and anyone in teaching should recognise the dangers of even joking about female students potentially not being up to it especially in the week that research irony of ironies from ucl showed teachers are less likely to judge girls good at maths even when they score as well as boys as for yearold comedians who find the laughs drying up well maybe its time to try updating the material instead of moaning that kids today dont know whats funny so no i dont think hunt is a great man wronged highly intelligent people are not immune to saying stupid things but what bothers me is that intelligent people are also hopefully capable of recognising when theyre wrong changing their minds accordingly and discussing it openly in a way that helps others recognise where they might be wrong too and absolutely none of that is achieved by forcing a symbolic resignation there are so many hunts thats the problem educated rational and otherwise agreeable men and indeed sometimes women of a certain age and background who beneath the surface hold surprisingly weird ideas about women or gay people or black people or anyone else they didnt come across much while growing up as judges theyre the sort who tend to portray yearold victims of abusive relationships as little temptresses as police officers the sort who dont take domestic violence as seriously as they should theyre the politicians forever being forced to apologise for saying something that privately they dont really regret and as employers theyre the stuff of working womens nightmares with their unshakeable belief that all females under are just waiting to get pregnant and give it all up for the baby but what theyre not necessarily is hatefilled misogynists or hopelessly beyond rehabilitation just people who dont seem to have noticed that the world has moved on a bit so what exactly should we do with them ageing sexists whose personal prejudices interfere with their ability to do the job obviously have to be tackled getting to grips with the basic principles of equality should be as nonnegotiable as and frankly not much more complicated than mastering the new office it system or keeping up with developments in your professional field but the first step should be retraining not issuing a p and above all it needs to be clear that failure to get the hang of this stuff makes you sound not just sexist but frankly past it ridiculous not just to women but to younger men too for the gap tim hunt has fallen down is arguably as much generational as gendered the yearold professor was educated at magdalen school followed by clare college cambridge neither of which admitted girls at the time you can see why encountering these exotic creatures at work might have come as a shock to his generation but their sons raised in different times are more likely to have learned to share an office with women without the sky falling in and their grandsons are being raised in a complex world that sometimes looks more segregated than ever all pink lego for girls and blue for boys but feels infinitely more fluid my son has grown up with girls on his football and cricket teams girls in science club girls in beavers and cubs which they join because its apparently more exciting than brownies little boys are as scornful about little girls as ever but theyre a lot more used to them more comfortable with the idea that they sometimes do stuff differently and sometimes dont and you just have to work around it seinfeld was right to argue that sexist isnt a word to be used lightly and certainly not used to shut down legitimate debate it carries too heavy a weight for that but as the idea of men and women being roughly equal becomes ever more mainstream and its dwindling band of opponents ever more shrill and eccentric well maybe we shouldnt be so surprised if future generations start using sexist interchangeably with loser for thats what with any luck it

women eh cant work with em cant complain about them without all bloody hell breaking loose on twitter whats a scientist to do im a great fan of the different varieties of outrageous sexism that we get exposed to on a fairly regular basis i particularly like the no woman is my equal kind and this week were seeing another variety being taken for a gentle canter around the ring with nobel prizewinning scientist tim hunts comments about the problems of having women in the lab in case youve been living under a rock or possibly hiding under a rock in case you fall in love with hunt he announced to a room full of female scientists and journalists that he has trouble with girls let me tell you about my trouble with girls three things happen when they are in the lab you fall in love with them they fall in love with you and when you criticise them they cry this was tweeted by connie st louis who is a scientist journalist and a woman and who presumably was watching the talk through a veil of tears as she fell in love hunt has since apologised albeit an apology if anyone was offended kind of apology and explained that his comments were meant to be humorous who among us hasnt when given the opportunity to speak to a room full of women journalists and women scientists felt that its time to break out the material about how overemotional women are and how women should be working in segregated labs its funny because its true ammirite girls of course the painful truth about humour is that if no one is laughing then it isnt funny insisting something is a joke is not a getoutofjailfree card to absolve yourself from making toxic comments and what is true is that science struggles with diversity being largely populated by white men like tim hunt in this context the joke really isnt funny women still fail to get taken seriously in many areas of science and as long as we assume this is womens problem with all the crying and whatnot then we are not going to see any change consider what happened to women in computer science in the west women were well represented as undergraduates until the s when we started to get computers in the home and they started to be seen as a male interest fewer women completed computer science degrees this shows that its scarily easy to affect how people choose what theyd like to do with their lives by positioning science as an essentially male occupation we make it harder to get women into science harder to keep them in the industry and harder to acknowledge and promote the female scientists who do make it through ive turned up at a conference to give a keynote speech only for the chap doing the it to flatly refuse to believe i was the keynote speaker because professor scott is a man i wonder if thats ever happened to hunt only kidding the it guy would have probably fallen in love with him hunt knows that some people are gay right ive run a lab for more than years now and not only do i hardly ever fall in love with any of my postdocs or students i find that its possible to work with both men and women without anyone crying often treating people with the sort of respect you yourself enjoy is a really good place to start even if they are women,2015-06,woman eh cant work em cant complain without bloody hell breaking loose twitter whats scientist im great fan different variety outrageous sexism get

the mask has not so much slipped as crashed to the floor stand up and be thanked sir tim hunt fellow of the royal society at the time of writing at least and the winner of the nobel prize for physiology for his work on regulators of the cell cycle here at last is someone who has come out with it women at work are a nuisance hunt chose his moment of public revelation at of all places a womens convention on science and journalism in south korea perhaps he thought theyd be flattered when he told them that the trouble with women in labs was that they fall in love and cry when theyre criticised this is what one of the science journalists who was there connie st louis tweeted note that old device that getoutofjailfree admission of chauvinism these are not the words of a victim whose meal was spiked with a mysterious truth drug they are the proudly admitted perceptions of a scientist a scientist drink that in yet from his reaction which was in the familiar nonapology apology of i am sorry if i have caused offence i should never have said such a thing in front of journalists it appears that he thinks it is he who has been in some way traduced confounded by that dratted tendency of women not to get the joke it seems quite likely that he is even now overwhelmed with supportive messages from colleagues for confronting the feminist thought police even the response of the royal society suggests that the great institution doesnt entirely get it science needs everyone regardless of gender they said as they frantically pedalled away from one of their leading lights how about sexism is wrong full stop yet this is a moment to savour hunt has at last made explicit the prejudice that undermines the prospects of everyone born with childbearing capabilities it is not men who are the problem it is women women are distracting they provoke emotions worse even than that they express emotions when criticised they cry all of this wasteful soppy girly stuff interferes with the male scientists duty to pursue truth with a singleminded purpose sound familiar a bit like say the educated mans version of the argument that says rape victims who wear short skirts or drink too much have only themselves to blame the argument that recommends anklelength sackcloth in order to allow men to get on with the real work in many ways hunt is one of those characters familiar from every workplace someone who has never troubled to consider the world in which he lives except from the perspective of how well it services his needs but he brings a particular defence to his prejudice he is in pursuit of the holy grail of truth because of this and his biologically endowed access to the right way to do it he can legitimately shout at anyone who he thinks has failed to appreciate the majestic significance of his purpose only the biologically inferior react with tears what is both shocking and bewildering about hunts jovial afterdinner remarks is that this is the considered view of someone whose life has been devoted to not taking the world for what it seems to be how bizarre that someone so entirely unreflective about his immediate surroundings can win a nobel prize for original work how bizarre that when he delivers his nobel laureate lecture he describes with a selfdeprecation that is the luxury of an unchallenged inner sense of rectitude the way that breakthroughs in his understanding came from mistakes like running a centrifuge for too long or attributing unexpected results to contamination but it never occurs to him to examine his own assumptions about the

tackling domestic violence may have finally found its place on the national agenda but disability advocates say the discussion has so far obscured and excluded the experience of victims living with a disability dr aminath didi an academic for a joint project between the university of new south wales and women with disabilities australia spoke at a domestic violence conference on wednesday in sydney she said this exclusion happened despite the fact violence suffered by women with disabilities tended to be more extensive suffered over longer periods of time and more severe than violence against men with disability or violence against women without a disability women and girls with disability made up of australias female population or about two million she said and came from a diverse range of sexual identity ethnicity employment status and type of impairment the stop the violence project conducted by women with disabilities australia people with disabilities australia and unsw found that violence intensified in frequency extent and nature when gender and disability intersect didi said women with disabilities were more likely to experience violence in residential and institutional settings and the nature of this violence and abuse include the withholding of medicine and assistance devices such as wheelchairs or refusal to assist with daily needs like bathing dressing or eating victims living in rural and remote communities were further disadvantaged due to a lack of services information and awareness and such problems were often seen as secondary to more basic needs like access to nutritious food shelter and security part of the problem lay in an inconsistent definition of what constitutes violence against women didi maintained it is generally conceptualised in the context of spousal or intimate partner or family violence which frequently excludes what women with disability experience in the settings where they live she said she said violence against women with disability extended beyond private and family dwellings into a range of institutions such as group homes hospitals prisons special schools and aged care homes and these forms of violence could include chemical restraint forced or coerced sterilisation forced contraception forced or coerced psychiatric interventions violations of privacy forced isolation and deprivation of liberty in these settings violence is considered a workplace issue didi said and not a human rights violation and potential criminal act joining didi at the ending domestic violence criterion conference was project chair and coauthor of the report preventing violence against women and girls with disabilities associate professor leanne dowse who said women with disability continue to fall through a whole range of legislative policy and service gaps this was the result of the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination which make them more likely to experience or be at risk of violence violence against women and girls with disability in all its form remains widespread and largely unaddressed dowse said and this was despite clear obligations by international human rights law to do so dowse said in relation to domestic violence against women with disabilities several international human rights monitoring bodies had raised serious concerns about australias low rate of reporting prosecution and conviction of perpetrators and an ongoing lack of data inclusive legislation policy services and support figures on the prevalence and incidence on violence against women with disabilities were hard to come by she said largely because our national statistical collection processes dont take disability status into account but that limited evidence indicated more than of women with disability experience a violent sexual encounter at least once in their lifetime and were more likely to be victims of domestic violence than women without disability legislation policy and service responses tend to view disability as an additional group whose needs are exceptional or additional to the central prevention agenda dowse said this means efforts and approaches to prevent violence against women in australia are piecemeal and inconsistent in definitions and scope she said it was time to demand accountability from government and from other duty bearers in recognising and addressing the rights of women with disability to live free from violence,2015-06,tackling domestic violence may finally found place national agenda disability advocate say discussion

scientists should work in gendersegregated labs according to a nobel laureate who said the trouble with girls is that they cause men to fall in love with them and cry when criticised tim hunt an english biochemist who admitted that he has a reputation for being a chauvinist said to the world conference of science journalists in seoul south korea let me tell you about my trouble with girls three things happen when they are in the lab you fall in love with them they fall in love with you and when you criticise them they cry hunt said he was in favour of singlesex labs adding that he didnt want to stand in the way of women the yearold who won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine made the remarks when addressing a convention of senior female scientists and science journalists his comments were tweeted by connie st louis who directs the science journalism program at city university london and was attending the conference she commented really does this nobel laureate think we are still in victorian times hunt is a fellow of the royal society which has distanced itself from the remarks tweeting tim hunts comments dont reflect our views it later released an official statement saying that it was committed to getting more women into science the royal society believes that in order to achieve everything that it can science needs to make the best use of the research capabilities of the entire population it said too many talented individuals do not fulfil their scientific potential because of issues such as gender and the society is committed to helping to put this right despite numerous education initiatives the number of women in science technology or engineering stem has remained stubbornly low only of people working in stem occupations are women according to wise which campaign about this issue the gap is also stark in academia where of fulltime professors working in science engineering and technology are men david colquhoun emeritus professor of pharmacology at university college london said hunts comments were a disaster for the advancement of women hunts words have also been roundly criticised by female scientists on twitter one woman a postdoctoral researcher tweeted for every tim hunt remark theres an extra woman in science that takes an interest in feminism ever wonder why there are so many of us hunt who won the nobel prize for discovering protein molecules that control the division of cells said when contacted for a comment im very sorry that what i thought were lighthearted ironic remarks were taken so seriously and im very sorry if people took offence i certainly did not mean to demean women but rather be honest about my own shortcomings this article was amended on december an earlier version said that prof hunt could not be contacted for a comment in fact he responded within an hour of being contacted but his response was not included in this early version of the story because of an editing

theres a common argument that is often used in discussions of sexism and sexual harassment it goes something like this imagine if that was your sister or your mother would you be happy to see her treated like that you can see why the argument is so common its often much easier to identify with a problem that directly affects us or somebody we care about than an abstract issue this week andy murray wrote in his blog for lequipe that he has become a feminist since witnessing firsthand the criticism and prejudice his coach amlie mauresmo endures he wrote the staggering thing was that she was slated every time i lost which is something my former coaches never ever experienced it wasnt right i got off to a bad start last season and things have only got better since amlie arrived i was ranked th in september im now ranked third it speaks for itself they say i was plucky choosing amlie but truth be told if anyone was plucky it was amlie shes the one whos taken the heat her competence was always under fire i felt embarrassed murray concludes have i become a feminist well if being a feminist is about fighting so that a woman is treated like a man then yes i suppose i have my upbringing means that im quite attuned to the whole thing i came to tennis thanks to my mother i always had a very close relationship with my grandmothers feminists are often frustrated and understandably so by the idea that a man should only be persuaded to care about the plight of half the worlds population because it impinges directly on somebody closely connected to him women should be considered as whole people in their own right not as appendages whose relationship as mothers sisters colleagues or lovers of men confers a new importance we should care about the harassment and oppression of women because it is wrong full stop but while i wouldnt use what if it was your sister as the central argument in any feminist appeal i still think we should embrace and welcome those like murray who come to feminism because their eyes are opened by people close to them feminism is not the only cause that finds new converts in those catalysed by personal painful experience the same is true of those who raise awareness of specific charities after a loved one is diagnosed with a disease for example and what starts as a gateway doesnt have to be the beginning and end of a persons experience of any particular cause of course nobody should care only about the experience of their own mother sister wife or friend but perhaps the empathy elicited by an abstract problem becoming personal leads to a wider understanding of the problem as a whole this is particularly pertinent when we are dealing with sexism because part of the problem is a constant bombardment of images and messaging that dehumanises women and encourages the viewer to see them as passive inert objects so associating sexism with a real woman you care about might be what it takes to shock you into rehumanising all women and thinking about their experiences more deeply the problem is also often hard to pin down sexism and harassment can be invisible to those not in the immediate firing line covert gropings in packed tube carriages shouted obscenities across darkened streets the looks accidental brushes and throwaway comments that are so hard to explain afterwards i am always amazed in any discussion of sexism on social media by the two completely different streams of tweets that flow simultaneously from men there are expressions of shock and disbelief from women weary sighs and recognition we still live in a society where an enormous amount of discrimination harassment and violence exists incongruously alongside a widely held belief that equality has already been achieved in that context we need all the support we can get we need people to see sexism in order to recruit them to the cause of fighting against it we need people to accept a problem exists before we can begin to tackle it and if the shock of hearing about the experiences of female relatives colleagues and friends is what it takes to kickstart that journey as long as the journey doesnt end there it can be a useful place to start so id urge men go and ask your female colleagues relatives and friends about their experiences be shocked be outraged but dont stop there let their answers spur you into action roll up your sleeves and start fighting for the right of all women everywhere to be treated like human beings,2015-06,common argument often used discussion sexism sexual harassment go something like

news reaches womenfolk in crochet classes around the globe that narendra modi the indian prime minister is proud of bangladeshi prime minister sheikh hasina for standing up to terrorism despite being a woman its a wonder hasina cares really given that terrorists absolutely do not have a track record of say shooting yearold campaigners for girls education in the head or keeping women as sex slaves as many people have taken to social media to point out women are capable of doing a lot of things including taking a stance against terrorism despitebeingawoman here are five others having a career its estimated that of women spend of their careers standing seething while a man who graduated straight out of the university of mansplaining takes credit for her ideas staggering really that despite apparently awful maths skills women have managed to swindle their way into accountancy departments posing as actual accountants or that even though th century oriel college don dr richard whately was right when he said a woman is a creature who cannot reason and pokes the fire from the top some of them have the gall to run around pulling people from burning buildings getting paid for it why is it that despite marie curie being on record as saying well i just fell into it really im not sure im all that women the world over still think its acceptable to go into science the new editor of this very paper is a woman expect to read about the four male brains behind the scenes responsible for her success soon being ok at sport i guess women are delicate creatures think small ailing bird on a daytime veterinary documentary nursed back to health with milk in pipettes that kind of vibe sometimes im not even sure how i get out of bed without splintering or swooning from the effort and yet sisters are out there running and other sports its adorable how weve moved on from benchpressing cottonbuds to doing decathlons and shit and even have a football world cup even though we have the inconvenience of once a month having to twirl around on beaches smiling while blue gel secretes from our vaginas we somehow also manage to bust moves and dunk hoops and smash aces and ripple goal nets never ceases to amaze me how even with tits the williams sisters jessica ennishill tanni greythompson et al win medals and set records quick shout out to kathrine switzer who ran the boston marathon in despite being a woman and despite some jokers with penises trying to hound her off the track still caring about sex crazy that there are still some women not content to limit their sexual experience to staring at a damp patch on a ceiling or being felt up on the night bus but we soldier on notallmen obviously are bad at sex im just saying that theres a reason its not heterosexual women who supposedly think about it every seven seconds if youve never watched straight porn it has all the sensuality of ramming a weeks worth of shopping into a freezer draw and thats a problem were dealing with in the internet age in the past two months how many men pressed the reddit button versus how many knowingly found their way to a clitoris ps sexually active men who never carry condoms like hosting a party and expecting the guests to always bring the balloons whats with that still despite all of this and despite being women here we are fighting for our orgasms and the right not to be called a slut on twitter while men tap the ash from their sixth postcoital fag managing to drive ive never really understood why us women though the human equivalent of tabs open at once in an internet browser capable of steering an exec board meeting while simultaneously worrying whether our kids got the bus ok and remembering elderly parents are due a visit think that this driving thing is a doddle driving is a mans pursuit and yet at least three times this week ive seen a woman behind the wheel of a car possibly women a lot of women have short hair these days not always clear how much plainer does it need to be given that the leading brand of satnav is named twice after a man that driving is for dudes and yet despite ovaries despite jeremy clarkson despite the orientation skills of a spinning top despite the fact we cant just pull over by the side of the road to piss into undergrowth we manage it getting from a to b sometimes back again take that saudi arabia kind of understanding politics hillary clinton is running for us president which is weird cos like shes old and a grandmother and basically can someone have a word a loud one cos shes old still women despite being women have achieved a little bit in the world of politics its just a shame that women at the dispatch box are shouted down by boorish suits or told to calm down dear or have their cleavages picked over by the press never mind that monica lewinsky at one point had a promising career in politics before she was basically slutshamed by the entire world were proud of her for giving it a go

rejoice fellow drones ding dong the queen bee is dead a survey by columbia business school in new york of companies over a year period suggests that female infighting is a myth and there is no such thing as queen bee syndrome whereby successful women scheme and connive to keep all the corporate honey for themselves the results of the survey will be presented at a conference of leading british girls schools this week the theory of women competing for an alpha females attention and either being screwed over by her or alternatively getting their revenge on her has been popularised for years by films including grease heathers clueless mean girls and the devil wears prada it has come to mean so much more than women competing at work it has come to symbolise something important about female identity female friendships and girl gangs in all sorts of different environments worst of all it has been accepted as some kind of truism that given half a chance women will be bitches and in any given group there will be one bitch who is the biggest bitch of all this makes for great drama it is not so fun in real life its also a dangerous mindset which keeps women in their little box afraid to trust others and constantly on the lookout for someone more senior who is going to knife them in the back instead this survey suggests women are held back not by each other but by men who dont want them in the boardroom women face an implicit quota whereby firms seek to maintain a small number of women on their top management team usually only one this is conspiracy theory time have women been blaming and fighting each other while ignoring whats really holding them back who is the real enemy us or them none of this thinking is useful and it feels horribly outdated the original queen bee myth stemmed from a study which suggested that women in key positions in organisations not only failed to support other women but actively worked to keep their rivals out another study from around the same time defined a queen bee as one who has succeeded in her career but refuses to help other women do the same this gave rise to an unofficial lift as you climb countermovement which eventually found its voice in the famous madeleine albright quote there is a special place in hell for women who dont help other women the problem with all this and im really not sure the new survey helps is that it encourages the sort of polarised blackandwhite thinking that has ensured feminism has made far fewer strides over the past six decades than it should have done do any of us really behave like a man or like a woman at work in the st century yes in movies which are fictional we encounter people like rizzo stockard channing in grease or regina rachel mcadams in mean girls yes in the workplace these kinds of toxic people might exist from time to time but in real life nasty narcissistic people are just as likely to be men as women similarly surely gender is not ever going to predict the person most likely to help you out with good career advice if this survey means a handful of paranoid women will be more openminded about trusting others then great but if it means the identification of a new enemy the evil menbees wont let us in the hive then we might as well go back to,2015-06,rejoice fellow drone ding dong queen bee dead survey columbia business school new york company year

australian of the year rosie batty has endorsed a union push for workers to be entitled to domestic violence leave of days a year to help them for instance navigate the court system batty is a wise and inspiring advocate for domestic violence victims yet something about the australian council of trade unions proposal is offkilter apart from business groups questioning why they should pay for leave for domestic violence victims why should we distinguish this crime from other serious offences why for instance should a woman who has been raped not be entitled to leave so she can deal with the police and the courts or a man beaten up outside a pub perhaps extra leave for victims of serious and violent crime of all sorts might have merit but somehow the focus is now so strongly on violence within the home that it has become a special case a crime apart one reason is that like rape domestic violence is a gendered crime now so burdened with gender politics that makes it hard to talk about it with any nuance it seems churlish to raise the illogicality of domestic violence leave it is especially tricky to challenge the orthodoxy that domestic violence impacts everyone pretty much equally because its about misogyny the contempt for women at the heart of the culture theres something that doesnt ring entirely true about that but question it at your peril former labor leader mark latham often flails around in fury and the way he suggested in a recent column that entrenched disadvantage was a key driver of domestic violence was as agenda driven as the privileged feminists he so loathes its become easy to dismiss latham and on cue his statement that the best way of minimising domestic violence is to minimise poverty was was rightly howled down as simplistic but also because it doesnt fit the acceptable narrative around this crime news corp columnist wendy tuohy wrote in response to latham about a woman she knows who lives in a posh house in a wealthy melbourne suburb and who lies about the purple bruises her husband inflicts when charles saatchi was photographed with his hand to the throat of nigella lawson numerous womens services came forward in australia to remark on the fact domestic violence cuts across all social demographics but is more hidden among the demographic that would otherwise rarely come into contact with community services she wrote former victorian police commissioner ken lay says much the same thing violence against women is not limited to any suburb or to the poor or to any fixed imagined type of person you have in your head feminist group destroy the joint has a project to count the number of women killed violently in australia so far this year its up to the group doesnt just count deaths resulting from domestic violence because they believe all these deaths are the result of societal misogyny surely this is a stretch in some cases the perpetrator is unknown and in four cases listed it is women accused of killing other women in two cases it is the womans own daughter accused of murder if everything is about misogyny then it risks becoming as much a hindrance to understanding as a help we cant deal with this crime until we understand the detail of it and its as complicated as any other for a start murder rates are at their lowest for years and the proportion of murders that are family related this includes killings by any family member not just an intimate partner are also down according to a recent australian institute of criminology report in they comprised of all homicides now its whats happening is a big jump in the reporting of domestic assaults because of a shift in attitudes by police the legal system and the courts and by women themselves being less willing to put up with violence behind closed doors and domestic assaults undoubtedly happen everywhere to all kinds of women and some men whether rich or poor educated or uneducated young or old its not just physical violence its psychological oppression and control too but drill down and like other crimes it is heavily concentrated in certain areas if we are going to respond other than in feelgood ways were going to have to target it where its most likely to happen both for victims and perpetrators tuohys affluent city friend is a victim of domestic violence but she would be far more likely to be so if she lived in a rural or remote community a nsw study over years ranked the local government areas where domestic assaults were reported the top five were in remote areas and all but one of the top were regional or remote towns campbelltown was the only metropolitan area in the top for rates of domestic assault the argument that wealthier bettereducated women have more options than to call police makes sense but why is there resistance to accepting that if violent assault and murder is more common in areas of severe disadvantage and stress then the same is likely to apply to domestic violence one study the voice against women survey in conceded its findings were out of step with others but concluded that intimate partner violence varied little according to education labour force status or household income yet there are many studies that suggest the opposite a nsw office for womens policy report in identified age low academic achievement low income or exclusion from the labour market social disadvantage and isolation and exposure to or involvement in aggressive or delinquent behaviour as an adolescent as associated with domestic violence perpetrators a study said certain factors increased the risk including financial problems or unemployment and recent stressful events or circumstances such as the death of a family member latham was not entirely right but he was at least half right one factor that nobody disputes is the role of alcohol again its not an excuse for violence but wed be kidding ourselves if we denied that our heavy alcohol consumption was unrelated to assaults of every kind politicians of all stripes refuse to deal with our boozesoaked culture because vested interests lobby so hard against it one nsw study found that of incidents of domestic assault reported to police between and were alcohol related close to half of intimate partner murders were alcohol related and that rises to among indigenous australians the most disadvantaged australians are likely to experience much higher rates of violence generally including domestic violence but here the generalised cry of misogyny is not so loud in many indigenous communities epidemic and crisis are accurate words to describe whats happening and few argue the primary cause is sexism there is debate among leaders about whether courts are too lenient on male aboriginal offenders and the notion that violence against women is cultural is rejected but if were going to tackle domestic violence this is where the most urgent action is needed particularly providing safe places for women to go to ignore the role of disadvantage lack of jobs despair and chronic alcohol abuse would be to see domestic violence in isolation if we can accept the complexity in indigenous communities we need to see it in nonaboriginal communities too none of this is to say that misogyny doesnt play a role theres enough evidence that it does and that men who are sceptical about gender equality are also less concerned about domestic violence and there is little doubt that this is a male dominated culture in any area youd care to look at but we seem to be denying the obvious by treating domestic violence as something entirely separate from other forms of violence subject to none of the usual stressors we know are associated with crime its easier to demand higher sentences a rally about violence against women last month in melbourne heard calls for a return of the death penalty or for the union movement to campaign for a new leave entitlement to make itself look progressive or for those who see

plans to give working parents of three and fouryearolds access to hours of free childcare a week will not work unless the scheme is properly funded and childcare providers are encouraged to offer greater flexibility says the uks leading advice charity citizens advice is warning that many working parents who need the scheme most could miss out if the new childcare bill which goes before parliament this week is not properly thought out the charity reveals that requests for advice about earlyyears provision have doubled over the past year reflecting mounting strains on working parents research to be published by citizens advice this month based on interviews with working parents suggests that inadequate childcare provision can have a significant impact on those trying to juggle a job with a family this can mean working parents having to reduce their hours and see a cut in household income damage to long term career goals as progression at work is held back and strain on relationships if friends or family members are asked to step in and look after children the lives of working parents are being held hostage by childcare said gillian guy chief executive of citizens advice as the number of inwork parents rises it is vital that the childcare market adapts to meet demand the growth of fluctuating work patterns means many parents need more flexible arrangements employers understanding and flexibility are also crucial previous analysis of the childcare market by citizens advice showed that almost a quarter of providers do not offer parents the current hours free provision while threequarters do not provide evening or weekend care the analysis also revealed an acute squeeze on places about of childcare providers reported that they did not have any spaces available without the right childcare in place parents work choices are limited which can make it harder for them to support their family guy said it is good news that free childcare is being extended but providers must be properly funded to offer the hours per week the government also needs to work with childcare providers to deliver more flexibility to fit around peoples changing working lives a department for education spokesperson said we are committed to helping hardworking families with the cost of childcare extending free childcare will make it more affordable for working parents and build a stronger economy by allowing providers to expand and helping new ones to enter the market we understand the importance of providing a sustainable rate of funding which is why we have already

throughout guardian australia has been chronicling cases where women have died and police have later laid charges against their partners or former partners while the circumstances of individual relationships often remains unknown what is conspicuous in domestic violence cases is how many women were in the process of leaving their partners at the time they were killed or had already left these cases serve as the most extreme examples of why the most dangerous time for a woman in an abusive relationship is commonly when she tries to leave fiona mccormack the ceo of domestic violence victoria said telling women to just leave an abusive relationship was not always practical advice unless a strong support network was already in place for the victim i think there can still be an assumption that its pretty easy for women to just leave and once they do the violence will just end mccormack said because of what we know about the dynamics and causes of family violence i think we need to start framing discussions around it by understanding male privilege and the idea of retribution that men who choose to be violent often have they have this sense of male privilege which means that they think they have the right to behave that way and think that their partner and children are possessions when a woman made the decision to leave mccormack said this was often seen by the perpetrator as a slight to their masculinity and ability to be in control so the man often believes he has to pay the women back mccormack said theres a sense of retribution im going to make you pay im going to hurt those you love im going to post embarrassing photos of you on the internet im going to kill you even if a woman could physically leave mccormack said many did not have the financial means to live on their own particularly if they had children or had been the victim of financial abuse that means they may be in temporary accommodation like refuges hotels shelters or public or social housing and rather than having stability for themselves and their children they are in this period of upheaval where children are often torn from their schools sporting clubs and extended family she said leaving an abusive relationship can mean entering chronic and longterm poverty and instability and we must build a system where women and children can stay in their own homes even when police have the power to remove the perpetrator from the home that means he still knows where his victim lives and so their safety may still be at risk it was why having a strong justice response where intervention orders were acted upon and where courts took breaches seriously was essential she said in april the prime minister tony abbott who is also the minister for women said he was committed to implementing a national domestic violence intervention order scheme within months so that perpetrators would be bound by the order across borders and not just in the jurisdiction in which it was issued the minister assisting the prime minister for women michaelia cash said the government was resolute in its commitment to reduce and eliminate violence against women it is a scourge on our society it will not be tolerated and we all must work together to eliminate it she told guardian australia the federal state and territory governments have different responsibilities when it comes to delivering domestic violence services the federal government delivers support and services through family law including legal assistance and the social security system while state and territory governments deliver justice services policing and legal assistance for victims and perpetrators they also fund and coordinate many services provided by the nongovernment sector cash said improving the coordination of the provision of services between the governments would be essential to curbing family violence and providing stronger support to victims a key goal of the commonwealths national year plan to address violence against women the government can not solve this issue by itself cash said a national and coordinated approach is fundamental to making sustained and meaningful progress it is only by working together with government media community and civil society organisations can we change community attitudes about gender equality and promote a nationwide change in the culture behaviour and attitudes that underpin violence against women in march cash launched the daisy mobile phone app developed by the support service respect which connects women to legal housing finance and childrens services women experiencing violence can have well founded fears around the concept of just leaving cash said at the launch but as well as support services for victims ensuring perpetrators are referred to and attend rehabilitation services is an essential part of domestic violence responses responses to family violence ignored the perpetrator at times of crisis a clinical and forensic psychologist who works with violent men says which means opportunities to prevent people who abuse their partners from continuing to do so were being missed dr troy mcewan a clinical and forensic psychologist researches how to better assess and treat people with problem behaviours like violence in particular she works with stalkers and in about half of cases she sees the stalker is an expartner mcewan believes there is a massive gap in crisis services available to perpetrators of violence at the times they are most at risk of causing harm with jail often the only and often unsatisfactory immediate response to stop them while there are mens behaviour change programs in australia where men receive counselling in a group setting mcewan said these programs were often at capacity and that men were referred to them too late after a crisis had occurred she said there needed to be a way to intervene and treat perpetrators sooner we need some kind of service where if police arrest a perpetrator they can actually send them to a service that can help them straight away rather than only arresting them because arresting someone doesnt do anything mcewan said i work with the police closely and they cant put everyone in jail thats not how it works you arrest someone and you release them and the situation goes exactly back to what it was so actually having some sort of service where the people who are actually causing the problem can be referred to and go to straight away no such service exists to my knowledge and to set up such a service would be challenging and complex she does not deny that such a service would be costly and given the risky situations involved resourceintensive but really to my mind that would be the only way to intervene in these cases because as hard as a victim might try to protect themselves fundamentally the person causing the problem is the one that needs the response otherwise the problem will continue she said psychologists were usually unable to become immediately involved in a family crisis situation mcewan said her own service has a sixweek waiting list these are very dynamic moving situations that are of very highrisk for usually a reasonably short period of time she said police dont know who to refer to in that period in a public healthkindof response you need to treat the cause of the problem and at the moment were treating the person being affected by the problem theres no immediate government service for perpetrators unless they are actually in prison which most arent as unpalatable as it may sound mcewan said trying to get her clients to change their behaviour by focusing on the impact it had on their victims and encouraging them to empathise with them was not the best way to change violent behaviour if youre very very angry with somebody and youre sitting in a room with a psychologist who is saying oh feel sorry for this person thats not going to get you anywhere mcewan said so often you spend a bit of time focusing on the cost to the perpetrator themselves and thats the first part of getting them motivation to stop offending there were a number of reasons men did not leave their partners alone once the relationship had ended mcewan said but often it was because the perpetrator believed they had a right to answers it will often be this one thing or a couple of things that get stuck in their mind and they keep making these contacts in an effort to get that message across mcewan said she needs to know what she did wrong she needs to know how much she hurt me are very common kinds of justifications for that continued contact but what could make her work complicated was that most people she works with do not see themselves as abusive they wouldnt call it stalking for example they would call it making telephone calls or going to see her mcewan said they dont see it as a course of conduct like a pattern of behaviour although of course the victim experiences it as an unrelenting pattern of behaviour a fiveyear research project from the uk known as mirabal examined the efficacy of mens behaviour change programs attended by men voluntarily or through referral by a partner court or social services the project run through the domestic violence organisation respect found women who reported having a weapon used against them dropped from to zero while those who said they were slapped punched or had something thrown at them fell from to after their partners or expartners completed the programs while there are mens behaviour change programs in australia no such nationally accredited programs exist there are minimum standards for perpetrator rehabilitation programs in some australian states and territories but these programs are rarely audited making it hard to understand their success rates jacqui watt is the chief executive of no to violence and the mens referral service which among many things develops and provide training resources and information for mens behaviour change professionals and programs in australia the programs go for about three months and usually involve one session a week in a group setting the men are encouraged to think about why they are resorting to violence and to understand they alone are responsible for their actions our starting point is always that violence is a choice watt said because of the deeply embedded societal nature of gender equity and male privilege and male sense of entitlement that is if you like sitting behind this expression of violence were trying to change how men think and how men behave in relationships to their partners to women and to children so this is really big stuff and clearly its not going to work first time every time watt says women should know that they can leave an abusive relationship and with the right support in place they can regain control of their lives but she doesnt pretend that it is easy it often was not making support services for women and men essential you can leave and you can get support you can recover from this i think the recovery message is so important it is possible but women should call a crisis service or see a specialised family violence counsellor and make sure they have support and a plan in place because theres a series of sophisticated levers in the system that need to be in place we also need to engage with these men at the point that theyre in crisis we need to be able to hold them in this crisis somehow so that they realise that theyve got to do something along that journey there will be many peaks and troughs its not a straight line but the bottom line is women just want the abuse the violence to stop victims of family violence can call the hour services respect an and family violence

to be honest i cant remember a single thing about the contents of this book mind you thats true of many books ive read i do know that i borrowed it from my girlfriend sally when we were students at oxford in the early s along with kate milletts sexual politics and germaine greers the female eunuch what i do remember is that the spare rib reader felt very different from those other books it had a slightly scruffy homemade feel about it more real more down to earth all three books grew out of the womens movement obviously but the reader felt like a team effort not just a womans voice but the voices of many women the voice of the movement itself a record of something important happening out there in the world it doesnt really matter that i cant remember the contents what matters is the effect that it had on me id never read a book about politics of any kind id certainly never read a book about feminism in fact i cant remember reading a single book written by a woman before the age of being a scienceobsessed boy growing up in the s skews it a little but even so id grown up on a diet of carry on films benny hill and my parents copy of the daily telegraph id simply never realised that the world was run by men for the benefit of men that women were treated as a different species less worthy of respect dignity human rights decent pay freedom from physical violence i hadnt realised that sexism was ubiquitous and that every woman suffered from its effects it was depressing but it was exhilarating too i began to see the world in a new way it went beyond gender politics it was about the way in which any group of human beings treats those over whom they have power but there was something else too at long last i had found a way of articulating an unease that i had felt for as long as i could remember at i was sent away to boarding school it was like lord of the flies in the fastness of the leicestershire countryside id always been uncomfortable with large groups of boys four years earlier i had to be taken home when i cried during my first night at cubs and i was always ill at ease with my fathers rugbyplaying friends now i was trapped in dormitory of boys hours a day for weeks at a time what i remember most vividly from the first few years is the sustained lowlevel fear that never quite went away it comes back to me whenever i see a group of lairy blokes three pints down on a saturday night the knowledge that some pack instinct might just take over at some point and the pack might start looking for a victim i knew that i was an outsider but i had no real sense of what i was outside of i was beaten by my housemaster in my third term at boarding school and while i knew that it was a sign of something being wrong with the whole system i didnt know what to do with that feeling the reader was the first in a long line of books that would help turn that unease into criticism and that sense of being an outsider into membership of a different community ive got a secondhand copy in front of me now and reading it is a surprise there is a widespread assumption one with which to my shame i seem to have gone along unthinkingly that the feminism of the early s was angry and dogmatic on the contrary the reader comes across as warm and generous and inclusive there are articles about womens history suffrage clothing secretarial work there are interviews with women of all backgrounds probation officers electrical engineers sexworkers schoolgirls teachers older women women with disabilities there are articles about womens lives in ireland in cyprus in ghana in puerto rico there are articles about advertising and short hair about industrial disputes and antisemitism about menstruation and police brutality there are cartoons by jo nesbitt and posy simmonds and a very moving series of drawings by norma pitfield of her mother as she lay dying its not for me to say because im not a member of the club but it reminded me of what a good word sisterhood was and made me sad that it has fallen out of use reading the book takes me straight back to the early s to the miners strike and apartheid to the nicaraguan revolution and the civil war in el salvador to the reassuring clarity of those battle lines it takes me back to dungarees and patchouli oil and separatist lesbians what happened to them i always hope they inherited a large slice of norfolk it takes me back to tempeh burgers and carob cake at the uhuru cafe on the cowley road in oxford where you had to do your own washing up uhuru wholefoods still sells the best muesli in the known universe and to eoa books where you could buy mary daly and andrea dworkin and ivan illich until the new age section housed in an alcove at the back grew like a tumour and took over the entire

never tell anyone you need to leave work early because of your children make something up you your partner your dog but never say its your kids this was the advice a female colleague whispered to me when i returned to work after having my first child my sons childcare centre called me the day before to tell me he had a temperature and was vomiting with my nervous newmother heart in my mouth i stood up from my desk and announced i was leaving to collect my sick baby apparently this was a big mistake because professional women dont discuss their children at work it was better if i told everyone i was leaving to collect my dog from the vet meanwhile the allmale executive team of that same company wore their children like badges of honour the more kids the better for those powerful breadwinners the ceos five children made him a legend that said i dont recall seeing them dash out the door for the school run nor did i hear them discuss remedies for croup as they flicked through their weekly board papers these issues were obviously delegated to others since that day other people have told me to hide my motherhood at work dont describe yourself as a working mother because it suggests you might be prone to slacking off said the senior partner of a professional services firm dont put maternity leave on your resume it will only act as a mark against you said the recruiter australian women account for only of ceos of executives and general managers and of senior managers onethird of companies that provide gender diversity data to the workplace agenda equality agency have no female executives or general managers at all woeful statistics that refuse to budge despite the constant chatter about the need for greater female participation in corporate australia every day i read about benchmarks quotas and targets business leaders publicly imploring why cant i get more women to work for me not long after i received the advice to hide my son i contributed to those woeful statistics opting out of permanent fulltime employment in favour of shortterm contracts and freelancing and with the number of female sole traders increasing by in the past years for male sole traders its only there are many women like me but i have also made the decision to always be honest about my kids with my clients if my child is sick i say i need to leave early because my child is sick if my child needs to see a doctor i say i need to come in a little late because my child needs to see a doctor im not ashamed to say i need to do these things for my kids because frankly i dont want to outsource my role as a mother i also work hard and fast to provide my clients the most productively rich hours possible in return for their flexibility in fact i work harder today than i ever did before i had kids i am proud of what i can contribute the desire to be with your children and the ambition that fuels a career are terribly conflicting emotions but they are very real and unless we start having some honest conversations about the demands of parenting it will always be difficult for parents to reconcile these two worlds thankfully i have worked with some ceos who also make a point of writing tuck shop in their busy calendars in some companies the culture is changing and more men are beginning to take a stand about leaving work to pick up kids or attend or concerts or carnivals theyre often greeted with much fawning oh isnt he great he picks up the kids which is pretty much the opposite reaction most women seem to get at the launch of the human rights commissions supporting working parents website on thursday it was once again highlighted how many women feel unwelcome when returning to work after maternity leave this means many women like me dont stay long after their return if they return at all keeping australias workforce participation rate for women dismally low while i understand that people may resent the fawning men get for a simple act of parenting the fact is that when people at the top whether male or female blend their personal and professional lives it normalises the working parent juggle and gives others permission to do the same you tend to find these rare creatures in companies that truly understand the concept of flexibility companies that measure productivity in terms other than the amount of time a person is seen sitting at a desk unfortunately these are still rare in corporate australia so working parents of australia i implore you next time you need to leave work early because your child has a nasty case of gastro dont blame the dog because all the workplace gender diversity benchmarks quotas and targets wont make a difference without the right attitude and empathy to support them and if we all keep hiding the demands of parenting how on earth will business leaders know what needs to change,2015-07,never tell anyone need leave work early child make something partner dog never say kid wa advice female

in her first public speech since resigning as the chief executive of westpac in february gail kelly has highlighted the violence and inequality faced by women and children living in extreme poverty speaking at a fundraising lunch in melbourne on tuesday for the aid organisation care australia for which she is an ambassador kelly spoke of her trip in july to vanuatu to see how people were rebuilding their lives after cyclone pam we were surprised at how many homes have not yet been rebuilt she said many people are still living in shared accommodation food is still a problem water is still a problem theres a lot more to be done but particularly in the area of gender and gender violence in the wake of natural disasters women and children were among those who suffered the most because they were also the most disadvantaged kelly said many had little money of any income a woman earned was given to her family or community and they did not own land kelly said this was exacerbated by genderrelated violence with women seen as secondclass citizens in many areas of vanuatu it was staggering how institutionalised gender violence was there kelly said women and girls are the lowest order women feel they have no control over their bodies for women in vanuatu their first sexual encounter is more likely to be forced than anywhere else in the world much of this is cultural with related family members having special rights over their relatives and its not seen as rape women had played a significant role in helping to repair the damage from cyclone pam kelly said those women who were allowed on to the committees of response teams thought about the needs of the whole community from children to the elderly she said men thought of themselves while women were the solution to bringing people out of poverty and rebuilding communities kelly said this could not happen until women were empowered given equal rights to men and sexual violence and exploitation stopped theres plenty of research to show that if you bring one women out of poverty they will bring four people with them kelly said its a good investment,2015-07,first public speech since resigning chief

in her diary entry for march barbara castle noted with an attempt at nonchalance the daily express has an incredible feature article why barbara is king of the castle she continued frank allaun a backbench mp popped up to me in the dining room in the house to tell me that at more than one meeting recently my name has seriously been canvassed for pm in june that year women workers at ford began a strike for equal pay the abortion act had become law secondwave feminism was beginning to lodge in the popular imagination equal pay legislation spare rib and divorce reform were just around the corner a woman leader of the labour party it seemed was surely the next step nearly years on the uks biggest and oldest mainstream progressive party has still not elected a woman leader women margaret beckett in the months after john smiths death and harriet harman now are ok to stand in as sensible effective interim leaders but elected not a chance yet within seven years of the suggestion that castle could be the pioneer the conservatives had elected margaret thatcher why thatcher and why not castle come to that why nicola sturgeon and natalie bennett in the general election why do new parties that have progressive agendas understand that women leaders can bring a humanity and engagement to the dry old bloke atmosphere of westminster yet yvette cooper and liz kendall are cringingly quizzed about their weight fertility and fashion choices and the implication from one of the other camps that they might not be tough enough for the five years ahead startlingly retro cooper called it there are other ways of putting it writing a biography of barbara castle it struck me as inarguable that her failure to make it to the top was partly an everyday tale of luck timing and chance shape political destinies but was also the peak of her popularity within a year she had destroyed her standing and undermined almost fatally her own political legacy after the thatcher assault on trade union rights many people would say that castles attempt to reform union law in place of strife was a courageous attempt to meet the challenge posed by strikes and industrial disruption which in the end played a big part in exiling labour from power it is also clear now that castles politics were feminine in a way that she who only ever described herself as a feminist when it seemed to offer some advantage never considered well before she trespassed on the trade unions right to selfregulation she had affronted millions of men by introducing the breathalyser to stop them killing other people and demanding that they avoid killing themselves by wearing seat belts she had a blithe disregard for the pay differentials in a way that ate into generations of carefully guarded privilege a party that was still predominantly about trade union representation in parliament would never have let castle become leader anecdotally that hypermasculine legacy lingers in other parties with close ties to the old industrial left germanys spd for example remains a strongly male preserve and if there is a pattern to where women break through to lead longestablished parties of the left as sgolne royal did briefly in france it has been as an emergency response that triumphs over old hostilities it was a sense of crisis that propelled thatcher into the leadership of the conservatives in a party where she was one of only seven tory women among men she alone had the nerve to challenge the orthodoxy and appeal to a panicstricken demand for something completely different that was only part of the story thatcher herself used to pretend it was as much of a surprise to her as it had been to most observers but that was one of the fictions she employed in order to disguise how confident she was in her own abilities as the first volume of charles moores biography makes clear it was thatchers radicalism that mattered not her gender which was fortunate since the knights of the shires referred to the contest as the filly against the gelding what they saw in her along with her good legs was the guts to make the country great again they were in a mess she dared to offer something completely different this is not only a political phenomenon its evident in the corporate world as two recent studies have shown in crisis send for a woman boards appoint women to lead when the share price is on the floor financial crisis looms or a predator lurks maybe its because crisis puts a priority on traditionally feminine strengths of teambuilding and people management skills that generate the confidence to tackle problems or maybe its just that the male candidates look at the balance sheet and say nah not this time it often doesnt turn out well so they call it the glass cliff thatcher stepped off it and prospered but for eight wobbly years it was a closerun thing in the corporate sphere women like xeroxs anne mulcahy who turned the firm from junk share to investment status in three short years have done it too but the great example is the german chancellor angela merkel it was she who had the courage to challenge helmut kohl after a scandal over party funding threatened to engulf the cdu in the late s she wrote an opinion piece for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung demanding change and said kohl her mentor and boss was an old warhorse incapable of the new leadership the challenge demanded she was party chairman within the year its a bit late for cooper to reinvent herself as an aggressive iconoclast ready to challenge party orthodoxy now and kendall who has made it her stock in trade could scarcely be said to have prospered by it but there is no one on the planet who thinks that one more heave will return labour to office this is only a guess but all the evidence tells us that however progressive their policies old parties of the left are in the grip of creaky outdated institutional structures too easily dominated by men too hostile to women to create a culture that encourages women to flourish labour needs radicalism innovation a sense of excitement a different style of engagement just the moment to send for a woman,2015-07,diary entry march

mary warnock philosopher and writer this question has been debated by women and men in philosophy for years and last week became the cover story in the times literary supplement of all the humanities departments in british universities only philosophy departments have a mere women members why should this be how can the balance be redressed on the whole i am very much against intervention by quotas or otherwise to increase womens chances of employment whatever the field and there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance i certainly dont believe it shows a conscious bias against women nor that it can be explained by the supposition that philosophy being concerned above all with arguments women are naturally less adept in the field there may be some women who think emotionally rather than rationally but heaven knows there are some men who do as well nor do i think that women dislike the idea of philosophy because of its supposedly adversarial style its devotion to winning an argument rather than seeking truth or consensus for i dont think this style when adopted in academic dispute is peculiar to philosophy no i think that academic philosophy has become an extraordinarily inwardlooking subject devoted not to exposing and examining the implications of the way we think about the world but to exposing instead deficiencies in the arguments of other philosophers if you pick up a professional journal now you find little but nitpicking responses to previous articles women tend to get more easily bored with this than men philosophy seems to stop being interesting just when it starts to be professional julian baggini philosopher and writer i agree there is little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy but that is not to say there isnt a great deal of unconscious bias the puzzle is why this should be stronger in philosophy than in other disciplines the answer i think is to be found in philosophys selfimage philosophers have tended to have an inflated sense of their ability to follow the argument wherever it leads as platos old saw has it what matters is the argument not the arguer which means there is no need even to think about gender or ethnicity philosophers have thus felt immune to the distorting effects of gender bias logic is genderneutral philosophy is logical ergo philosophy is genderneutral i suspect this has led to complacency a blindness towards all the ways in which in fact gender bias does creep in it is a wellestablished finding in psychology that believing you are an objective judge actually makes your judgments less objective and im sure philosophy suffers from this i admit that this explanation for at least part of the underrepresentation of women in philosophy is somewhat speculative but i would be interested to hear what you make of it mw i dont accept that all our thinking is genderpermeated and that we therefore fail to notice our bias i believe that one of the great merits of academic philosophy is that its central topics are as genderneutral as those of physics mathematics or linguistics but i agree that women may have different hopes of the outcome of examining these topics and that they are on the whole less likely than men to follow the argument wherever it leads and change direction if it leads to absurdity or paradox this is another way of saying that women are more restricted than men by the dictates of common sense and this goes along with or is part of a desire that philosophy should be intelligible to nonphilosophers if they are willing to give their minds to it of course this desire is not peculiar to women as your writings prove the dislike of abandoning common sense may seem like oversimplification though it may better be described as distaste for scholasticism it certainly means that in job interviews women may seem pedestrian rather than brilliant and this may damage their chances of success jb it may well be that women tend to have different intellectual priorities from men but since we do not know how much these are cultural or biological we should not assume that any such differences are fixed more importantly this would be all the more reason to endeavour to get more women into senior positions in philosophy since there is no reason to suppose the traditional priorities are superior it is important to distinguish the idea that all philosophical ideas are genderpermeated which we both reject from the idea that gender biases affect the ways of thinking and acting of all philosophers for instance rae langton and jennifer hornsby have argued persuasively that cultural norms and stereotypes can detrimentally affect the ability of women to be heard and taken seriously im fairly sure this handicaps women in philosophy just as it does in pretty much every other domain you are against quotas and other forms of intervention does that mean you think nothing can or should be done mw i find i agree with something you said earlier that men are complacent in believing that their intellectual priorities are the best and this makes it more difficult for women to make their voices heard but i am still against positive intervention because this always carries the risk that the woman appointed under say a quota system will be seen as not necessarily the best candidate and so be further undermined i think rather that in philosophy if not in other disciplines things are gradually changing partly because of the work of some women such as onora oneill and some men such as yourself the application of philosophical methods to other subjects is becoming more widely recognised for example the connection between moral philosophy and medicine is now widely recognised and perhaps more significantly the interface between philosophy and psychiatry is being increasingly explored this broadening of the scope of philosophy will inevitably if gradually attract more women to the subject jb quotas are indeed problematic but there are other possible affirmative action interventions such as requiring departments conferences and journals to monitor closely the number of women applying or submitting papers compared to those accepted simply forcing people to attend to any apparent imbalances is a forceful way of raising awareness another priority is to make philosophers understand better the psychological effects which interfere with their supposedly clear rational thinking they should all know for example about sally haslanger and jennifer sauls work on how psychological phenomena such as implicit bias and stereotype threat might be at work in their subject but the most important and effective change is simply for philosophers to face up to the depth of the problem in their profession too many complacently assume that any sexism in the subject is now minor and residual seven years ago haslanger wrote in my experience it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isnt actively hostile towards women and minorities or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a traditional white man haslanger persevered but if other talented women are either giving up or being overlooked that is as much philosophys loss as it the sisterhoods critical reflections on ownership edward elgar by mary warnock and freedom regained the possibility of

women are not tough enough to lead labour read the headline on page six of the times on friday above an article about things i had said concerning the leadership the relevant quote from me was neither yvette cooper nor liz kendall can steer the party through the challenging few years ahead of us when we need a leader who can reach out to all wings of the party and provide unity the headline was wrong at every level it suggests i said the words in inverted commas in the headline i didnt and nobody else in the article did either and the headline suggests i think that women are not tough enough to lead the labour party that is not my view and i said nothing that suggested it was the storm has been caused by the inaccurate headline the times itself has acknowledged in emails that the headline was stupid misleading and sexist it has changed the headline over the story though not over the index page i was part of a government that has a proud record on womens equality from the national minimum wage that reduced the gender pay gap to action on domestic violence which recognised that for many women home is the most dangerous place to childcare on a scale never offered to parents before but it is clear that more needs to be done the question for our party is who is best to lead us at this very difficult time in our history of course liz and yvette are talented and tough enough to lead my view though is that andy burnham is best we have a monumental task to regain confidence and build public support for policies to tackle childhoods lost to poverty ambitious young people thwarted by their lack of skills and hundreds of thousands desperate for a place to call home we need a leader who can best formulate the centreleft case for government unite the party behind that case and persuade the public to elect us to govern and we must also have a leader who can build a team who can ensure our values are embedded in our policies and in the way we do our politics of course the brunt of this governments dreadful austerity will be borne by women if we do not develop policies that provide answers and reflect the needs of the communities we serve as a political party and that can persuade the public to elect us again we will be able to do nothing for them andy will be judged on his record he fought within and outside government for the hillsborough families i saw him do it he stood up for people who needed him it cost him to do so he was compassionate unbending and brave they could not have had a better champion he has a big vision and will drive radical reform he has driven the policy to join up health and social care he has done so when people within and outside the party said he should not he has made that policy one now accepted by all he is a successful campaigner he stood up for the nhs through the past five years of opposition and despite the differing views within the party about the correct stance to take on nhs issues he united the party around the positions he took we ended up ahead of the tories on health service issues he connects with the public people who meet him like him they like his warmth and his openness in the wake of our defeat none of the candidates for leader are going to have all the answers now but andy burnham has the character the values and the track record which make me think he is best equipped to lead the party on the journey ahead if the country gives him the chance in i have no doubt that he would be a prime minister the party and the country would be proud of and would make our country a much

perhaps a recent new york times article suggests that young women today are managing to keep that whole worklife thing pretty much balanced how by planning and by lowering expectations more than ever young women are reportedly planning their careers and when to interrupt them to better accommodate having babies knowing that the workplace is still rarely a welcoming place for a new mother the new york times reports that a pew research center study found that of working millennial mothers said being a working mother made it harder for them to get ahead in their careers compared with of older women its apparently one of the reasons women are strategising their lives earlier on and choosing careers that will allow for a more flexible approach to work theyre anticipating that in some way theyre going to have to dial down or integrate their career and their life one female ceo told the paper its a savvy if perhaps depressing move especially when you take into account the findings of a new equality and human rights commission report published today into the discrimination faced by women returning to work it reveals that approximately new mothers are losing their jobs across britain every year a number that has doubled in a decade maybe theres no clearcut answer to that question after all sexism by degrees centigrade sticking to thinking about the workplace summer in an office is miserable for two reasons one youre not outside enjoying the sunshine and two youre inside and freezing because the air conditioning is ramped up so high you are swaddled in a scarf and your teeth are chattering louder than your colleagues complaints about the lack of semiskimmed milk to add insult to injury if youre a women you may well notice that your male colleagues arent fazed by the icy temperatures its this realisation that led washington post writer petula dvorak to the conclusion that air con is another vehicle by which the patriarchy can exert power theres already evidence that suggests women feel the cold more keenly so the fact that men arent wrapped in blankets at their desks dvorak believes must mean that those in charge of the thermostat are male after leading a straw poll of workers in other offices no ones pretending that this is a scientific investigation dvorak concluded that yes the women were all freezing while the men barely noticed the temperature sure women could swap their perfectly weatherappropriate clothes for something say woollen but the men as dvorak points out could also wear less plus dvorak includes research that shows the warmer an office the higher the productivity so men take off the suit jacket and turn down the air con please cringe when it comes to choosing the right birth control there are a couple of things that will help you make the right decision information and an experts advice one thing you probably dont need or didnt think you needed is a website that creates something called a shemoji and yet pharmaceutical brand allergan seems to think differently the company has launched a new website and campaign that targets millennial women in need of contraception by talking to them in their language using the hashtag actuallyshecan celebrity endorsements from the likes of glees lea michele and tv personality lo bosworth as well as with live events allergan hopes to help women get more informed and more educated because those are real needs theres no doubting that allergans aim to open up a conversation around reproductive health is an important one and that it makes sense to target millenials with an online campaign but isnt this all a bit patronising to think that the only way women can engage in a discussion surrounding their health is in internet speak as forbes writer and allergan customer sarah hedgecock wrote the campaign feels like something devised by a person who learned everything he knows about millennial women from buzzfeed and despite trying to empower the campaign appears to reduce millennial women to nothing more than selfies and spin bikes suggesting that users add the hashtag actuallyshecan to posts such as selfie like noones watching and getting back on the spin bike which makes you think tallergan should spend less time on instagram and more time finding out what it would really take to open up a serious discussion around birth control walkin in a womens wonderland after sandi toksvig announced she was cofounding the uks first feminist political party the womens equality party back in march everything went a bit quiet but now four months later it looks like things are swinging into action this week the wep finally gained a leader yearold journalist sophie walker and an agenda along with branches across the country with people becoming paidup members of the party on the first day that membership went public earlier this month the wep is reportedly the fastest growing party in the uk of course having only just been founded it will launch officially in september thats not necessarily surprising but if the wep can keep a steady rate of signups coming in then its membership could easily rival that of some other notsominor parties in the near future looking at the tidal wave of support id be very surprised if we hadnt managed to take this mainstream walker told the telegraph adding that she expects the wep to have won seats in elections in the next five years but what will people be signing up for so far the partys goals include equal pay equal representation in the media equal parenting rights and an end to violence against women but the details of actual policies will come in part from the weps members as walker told the independent were starting from scratch why should we do things the old way we are opening politics up to real people well get policy suggestions from our members who exactly makes up the membership is hard to tell although walker is clear that its not just middleaged white women the committee has got disabled people men women of black and ethnic minority race and gay people and that spread really goes through our branches too watch this space thompsons swift takedown while taylor swift nicki minaj and their various cohorts have been busy getting into a very public spat with each other on twitter this week emma thompson has been having a go at the matter of sexism in hollywood the actor who with the help of some expertly applied prosthetics is soon to appear on screen as a yearold sex worker had some choice things to say about the state of feminism in the film industry today telling the radio times i think its still completely shit actually i dont think theres any appreciable improvement and i think that for women the question of how they are supposed to look is worse than it was even when i was young so no i am not impressed at all when i was younger i really did think we were on our way to a better world and when i look at it now it is in a worse state than i have known it particularly for women and i find that very disturbing and sad of course thompson isnt the only actor keen to point out the prejudices levelled against her gender recently thompsons bff meryl streep sent a letter to every member of congress lobbying for the womens equality act to be made part of the constitution and her other pal helen mirren didnt mince her words when asked her

patriarchy is inventive the minute a generation of women has figured out how to not be enslaved by ideology a some new cultural pressure arises in the form of internalisation b making sure they dont get too far too fast the latest example the most empowered generation of women ever todays twentysomethings in north america and britain is being hobbled in some important ways by something as basic as a new fashion in how they use their voices this demographic of women tends to have a distinctive speech pattern many commentators have noticed it often with dismay time magazine devoted a column to the mannerism called vocal fry noting a study that found that this speech pattern makes young women who use it sound less competent less trustworthy less educated and less hireable think britney spears and the kardashians vocal fry is that guttural growl at the back of the throat as a valley girl might sound if she had been shouting herself hoarse at a rave all night the less charitable refer to it privately as painfully nasal and to young women in conversation sounding like ducks quacking vocal fry has joined more traditional youngwomen voice mannerisms such as runons breathiness and the dreaded question marks in sentences known by linguists as uptalk to undermine these womens authority in newly distinctive ways slate notes that older men ie those in power over young women find it intensely annoying one study by a deeply annoyed professor found that young women use uptalk to seek to hold the floor but does cordially hating these speech patterns automatically mean you are antifeminist many devoted professors employers who wish to move young women up the ranks and business owners who just want to evaluate personnel on merit flinch over the speech patterns of todays young women because of their runon sentences i cant tell in a meeting when these young women have said what they have to say confided one law partner their constant uptalk means i am constantly having to reassure them uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh its exhausting i myself have inadvertently flinched when a young woman barraging a group with uptalk ran a technologybased conference call well use ruby on rails it is an mvc framework to support databases well will we one yearold woman working in engineering told me it was easier for gatekeepers in her maledominated field to disregard runningon softspoken vocally frying and uptalking women it is difficult for young women to be heard or even responded to in many maledominated fields if they dont strengthen their voices that kind of disregarding response from men made me feel even softer and even lesser in a vicious circle of silencing she said style is content as any writing teacher knows runons and noncommittalness dilute many young womens advocacy powers and thus their written authority many young women have learned not to go too far out on a limb with their voiced opinions but the dilution of voice and the muddying of logic caused by runon sentences in speech can undermine the power of their written thought processes and weaken their marshalling of evidence in an argument at oxford university young women consistently get to fewer firstclass degrees in english and the exams are graded blindly the reasons even the most brilliant tend to avoid strong declarative sentences and to organise their arguments less forcefully elleke boehmer an oxford english professor says i often observe my female students silence and lack of confidence in class with concern how anxious they are about coming forward to express an opinion to risk a point of view so often letting the male students speak first and second and even third and in this way they lose out in the discussions that are going to help them hone their pitch write winning essays secure the outandout firsts that male students in humanities subjects still are securing in far greater numbers proportionately than they are the problem of young womens voices is gaining new cultural visibility recent books and plays have dealt with the suppression of young womens voices boehmers own recent novel the shouting in the dark narrates the inner life of a young woman in south africa in the s and shows how abuse breaks such a voice the hit play nirbhaya in which indian actresses narrate stories of their own rapes also shows how young womens voices are stifled by cultural silencing even today voice remains political at work as well a catalyst study found that selfadvocacy skills correlate to workplace status and pay more directly than merit in other words speaking well is better for your career than working hard but amy giddon director of corporate leadership at barnard colleges athena centre for leadership studies in new york found in original research that there is a disconnect between womens confidence in their skills and abilities which is often high and their confidence in their ability to navigate the system to achieve the recognition and advancement they feel they deserve selfadvocacy is a big part of this and identified by many women in the study as the biggest barrier to their advancement in other words todays women know they can do great things what they doubt reasonably enough is that they can speak well about those great things when you ask young women themselves what these destructive speech patterns mean to them you get genderpolitical insights i know i use runon sentences a yearold intern at a university told me i do it because i am afraid of being interrupted no one has ever taught her techniques to refuse that inevitable interruption i am aware that i fill my sentences with question marks said a twentysomething who works in a research firm we do it when we speak to older people or people we see as authorities it is to placate them we dont do it so much when we are by ourselves surely we older feminists have not completed our tasks if no one has taught this young woman that it was not her job to placate her elders ally tubis a yearold star in the maledominated data analysis field explained that at first sounding far younger than her years helped her to feel safe but finally admitting that i had a voice problem and then having the guts to practice strengthening it gave me confidence as that process took a lot of courage tubis took voice training and her career soared why was it scarier to have a strong voice rather than a very breathy voice i asked her i would purposely do things in the past to detract from getting even positive attention tubis explained the breathier voice camouflaged her what is heartbreaking about the current trend for undermining female voice is that this is the most transformational generation of young women ever they have absorbed a feminist analysis and are skilled at seeing intersectionality the workings of race class and gender unlike previous generations they arent starting from zero they know that they did not ask to be raped that they can slutwalk and take back the night kickstarter their business ventures and shoot their own indie films on their phones and that they deserve equal pay and access which points to the deeper dynamic at play it is because these young women are so empowered that our culture assigned them a socially appropriate mannerism that is certain to tangle their steps and trivialise their important messages to the world we should not ask young women to put on fake voices or to alter essential parts of themselves but in my experience of teaching voice to women for two decades when a young woman is encouraged to own her power and is given basic skills in claiming her own voice then huge good changes follow when my voice became stronger people took me more seriously says ally tubis when people feel from your voice that you are confident they will believe that you are smarter and that you are better at what you do even when you are saying the exact same thing,2015-07,patriarchy inventive minute generation woman ha

women returning from maternity leave are more likely to face discrimination in the workplace than they were a decade ago according to a report published today by the equality and human rights commission the study by the ehrc estimates that around new mothers are losing their jobs across britain every year almost twice the number identified in similar research undertaken in it also found that of women were discouraged from attending antenatal appointments by their employers putting the health of mother and baby at risk caroline waters deputy chair of the ehrc said the report pregnancy and maternityrelated discrimination and disadvantage highlighted worrying levels of discrimination and disadvantage at work that women still face a survey of more than women carried out by the authors of the report produced in conjunction with the department for business innovation amp skills found that one in nine had been dismissed made compulsorily redundant or treated so poorly they had to quit their job scaled up to the general population this could mean as many as mothers lose their jobs every year the report also reveals that of women said they were treated worse by their employer after returning to work after having a baby one in five new mothers as many as mothers a year experienced harassment or negative comments from colleagues employer or manager when pregnant or returning from maternity leave said they were put under pressure to hand in their notice one in reported receiving a cut in pay or bonus after returning to their job even when mothers were given the chance to work flexibly on their return to work around half said it cut their work opportunities and they felt their opinion was less valued justine roberts chief executive of parenting website mumsnet said women faced discrimination while pregnant and after giving birth on a regular basis in mumsnets own research two thirds of the sites users felt less employable after having a child and three quarters said it was harder to progress in their careers despite legislation designed to protect women from discrimination in the workplace its clear that in many cases companies are simply not following the rules said roberts its shortsighted for employers to lose talented women who have built up skills and experience just because of unwillingness to support them on maternity leave and on return to work most managers surveyed by the report said they were firm supporters of female staff during and after their pregnancies with two thirds stating they did not think pregnancy puts an unreasonable cost burden on the workplace four out of five believed pregnant women and new mothers were just as committed to their work as colleagues rosalind bragg director of maternity action said that david cameron despite promising to make britain the most familyfriendly country in europe had instead overseen a significant deterioration in the situation of mothers in the workplace this research paints a shocking picture of the experiences of pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace she said it is unacceptable that women each year are dismissed or bullied out of their jobs purely because they became pregnant action to protect womens rights to work during their childbearing years is long overdue the government needs to move beyond familyfriendly rhetoric to delivering practical solutions to this widespread and growing problem bragg called for specialist advice and support for women to pursue unfair and unlawful treatment by their employers and the scrapping of employment tribunal fees which she said denied access to justice to the vast majority of women the study results were very disturbing said cathy warwick chief executive of the royal college of midwives evidence shows that missing antenatal appointments can increase the risk of smaller babies premature babies miscarriages and stillbirth she added belinda phipps chair of the fawcett society said it was deeply troubling that

my stance is unambiguous on domestic violence there is no place for it in the game nrl ceo david smith told fairfax media at the weekend he was answering a question about why roosters player shaun kennydowall had not been stood down after he was charged with counts of assault of his former girlfriend jessica peris smiths quote is in line with the national discourse were having around violence against women an issue that state governments australiawide are making a concerted effort at stamping out its in line with rosie battys appointment as australian of the year its in line with what the national rugby league should be saying but smiths lip service to ending whats been repeatedly called a national emergency wont end anything certainly not the career of a promising nrl player gold coast titans player greg bird recently copped an eightweek ban for a dangerous throw in a game against new zealand in may its not his first ban in he was found guilty of assaulting his then girlfriend by smashing a glass in her face the conviction was overturned on appeal the cronulla sharks his club at the time stood him down but following a brief stint in europe hes back in the nrl in south sydney captain greg inglis was charged with assaulting his nowwife sally robinson but escaped conviction in with a diversion order to attend a mens behaviour change program and a donation to a womens health service earlier this month inglis was on the front page of the couriermail with the headline respect after queensland won the state of origin series fellow rabbitoh kirisome auvaa pleaded guilty to a drunken assault of an exgirlfriend only last year but will return in round having had his indefinite suspension downgraded the sharks ben barba allegedly struck his partner ainslie currie so hard that bloodied photographs of her appeared in the daily telegraph in hes now enjoying a prominent career with cronulla although the roosters blake ferguson was convicted of indecently assaulting a woman in a nightclub he remains one of the codes favourite sons most recently fellow rooster shaun kennydowall was charged with serious allegations including assault occasioning actual bodily harm common assault destruction of or damage to property and stalkingintimidating yet the nrl has decided not to stand him down according to abs statistics one in three women will suffer violence at the hand of an intimate partner or expartner in their lifetime the nrl is certainly not unique in having to face up to the scourge of violence against women but it is uniquely placed to deal with it rugby league is one of the most popular sports in our country and commands millions in sponsorship and salaries each year every week thousands of fans make the trek to see their sporting heroes in action despite the chill of winter in places like canberra and auckland hundreds of thousands more tune in weekly to watch their teams on tv with the tv rights worth billions of dollars merchandise is sold to young and old team allegiances are formed at birth and young footballers will stop at nothing to get a lucrative professional contract a funeral i recently attended asked mourners to dress in red and white such was the deceaseds passion for the saints the influence of the nrl and its players means that alongside the glory and the mateship the press conferences and the pretty girls must come the downside of playing professional football being a responsible role model the nrls failure to adequately condemn those players who dont live up to the fame bargain by assaulting women suggests that violence against women in fact does have a place in the game despite smiths assertions to the contrary nsw premier mike bairds suggestion that we need to see some stronger messages coming from the nrl couldnt come at a better time because it appears right now that the nrl doesnt care about players violently assaulting their wives their girlfriends or strangers temporary suspension of players says that violence can be forgiven and the violent assault on a woman forgotten after a ban for an arbitrary number of rounds the nrl failing to act on players committing criminal offences tells us that the men who assault the women in their lives can simultaneously be heroes and put on a pedestal to be worshipped a dangerous game indeed,2015-07,stance

a visit to vancouver in canada this week made me remember one of the basic but almost forgotten pillars of feminism antihierarchical collective working and in remembering it and seeing it in action i have come full circle and learned to love it again vancouver rape relief founded in is the best example of collective work i have come across in my years of feminist activism the members who are a wide range of ages ethnicities and class backgrounds share responsibility for crisis work running the support and education groups financial and membership decisions and the planning of feminist activities they even have collective responsibility for deciding which allies can support the work of the organisation vrr must be doing something right it has outlived all other direct service provision for women and has women knocking on its door asking to be considered for the training programme that would enable them to become a collective member vrr is a hotbed of radical politics and is widely respected within the broader left and within the womens movement when i joined what was then the womens liberation movement in the leftist traditions on which it had been built still prevailed our groups were all collectives their hierarchy being procapitalist and patriarchal having bosses and workers served to keep workingclass poorly educated and black and minority ethnic women at the bottom of the ladder because feminism was for all women went the mantra we should be more concerned about the women in the basement than those cracking their carefully coiffured hair against the glass ceiling in many ways collective working was successful workingclass women like me were afforded as much respect for informal skills as the women who were eminent professionals and we recognised we could learn from each other but there were some hilarious moments i recall a collective meeting about setting up a weekly telephone support service for lesbians it was decided that each collective member would volunteer to take turns manning the phones at their own home until we could raise the money to rent a space one of the members did not have a telephone in her house but insisted she was being discriminated against and oppressed by being left out of the rota there were other problems whenever the media wanted a quote from a feminist organisation the collectives always missed out in favour of those with a hierarchical structure all decisions had to be made by consensus so if the journalists deadline was the next day it was no use explaining that our next meeting was a week on thursday the idea was that all work would be shared equally among the collective members if you joined a rape crisis centre for example you could be answering the phone to a distressed woman who needed to disclose appalling sexual violence cleaning the kitchen or delivering leaflets collective living was also encouraged unlike today when most of us gay or straight seem to be railroaded into monogamous coupledom and marriage back in the day we often lived in groups bonded by our political activism and vision raising each others children and sharing tasks and latenight discussions there was a total resistance to the cult of the individual and until the thatcher government declared war on society no dogeatdog narcissism was tolerated but this model was not wellknown for praising the achievements of the individual which disproportionately affected those of us not born with a sense of entitlement sort of betraying the objective slowly the collective way of working petered out and the movement became professionalised in line with nonfeminist structures we had to apply for funding as we could no longer afford to work fulltime voluntarily which meant we were under pressure to keep the funders happy feminist collectives are still around albeit thin on the ground most can be found on the internet which means that members do not have to endure the downside of such ways of working such as sitting in endless meetings unable to reach agreements and taking days to produce one leaflet because someone objected to the word seminal in these times of neoliberalism working

could a woman ever have won the affection of reddit the closest thing the internet has to a frat house with the resignation of ellen pao as interim chief executive of the linksharing and discussion site we may never know because which woman would be brave and foolish enough to take on a highprofile role at the site now in the eight months after taking on the job pao did what reddits board asked her to she tried to expand the sites audience beyond its core user base of young white american men for that she was compared to hitler had her personal details posted online endured crude jokes about her sex and ethnicity and saw people sign a petition calling for her to be ousted but lets rewind why should anyone care what happens on a glorified discussion board with far less name recognition than peers such as facebook or twitter the nature of the internet means that even incredibly popular sites and reddit has more than million users can be unknown to outsiders but even if you havent heard of reddit you will have seen one of its creations it spawns many of the viral news stories that drive so much traffic to the mainstream media over the past few years reddit has also come to be associated with a particular type of internet user the kind of people who believe that unless they are given unfettered space to be as offensive and disruptive as they want we might as well declare free speech dead and all move to north korea in the past the site has hosted forums with names such as creepshots dedicated to photographs of women taken without their knowledge jailbait where users shared pornographic images of women who looked underage and a whole slew of racist microsites known collectively as the chimpire the rationale for all these was the usual one given for bad behaviour online dont get mad its just the internet not real life that attitude has gradually polluted reddit overshadowing its many beautiful thoughtful and well curated forums on subjects such as politics world history and landscape photography it has also threatened its m market valuation as advertisers the lifeblood of the free internet dont want to promote their brands next to pictures of dead babies or instructions on how to drug and rape women during paos tenure the site began to shut controversial subreddits such as transfags and fatpeoplehate perhaps the backlash to that might have been contained such forums are only a small part of the site if the protesters had not managed to piggyback on another unpopular decision the departure of a popular staff member victoria taylor they managed to transmute their grievance into a wider narrative about a company that didnt care about its users on one level they had a point reddit like other social networks relies on a huge amount of unpaid labour not just from usergenerated content but from an army of volunteer moderators the changes to the site prompted many to ask were they just customers who had to take the product as offered or should they have more rights this is the same uncomfortable grey area between users and workers that fuelled the online hate campaign known as gamergate when so much of the internet is free to use it is difficult to hit companies in their pockets to some the logical alternative is to hound companies key decisionmakers instead and pao certainly was hounded one user proclaimed he or she had found ellen paos family crest it was a picture of a swastika others dubbed her chairman pao and compared her tenure to being ruled over by kim jongun reddit is a popular site among mens rights activists or antifeminists as they are more accurately called and the discovery that pao had launched an unsuccessful action for sexual discrimination against her former employers kleiner perkins was presented as proof that she was not up to the job the petition to get rid of her suggested she had sued her way to the top even though making allegations of sexism against your employer is generally recognised to endanger your future job prospects rather than enhance them as the tech commentator kaliya young put it ellen was at the centre of a highprofile sexual discrimination suit versus a major vc venture capital firm and she was put in charge of the teenage boy section of the internet what did you expect was going to happen it was inevitable that they would turn on her the abuse of pao was predictable reddit forums have been the staging posts for online harassment campaigns before such as the hate campaigns waged against the videogame critic anita sarkeesian and the developer zoe quinn having tacitly encouraged the site to become a swamp of racism and sexism no wonder the board was unable to protect its own chief executive the bile also demonstrated the falsity of arguing that we must give a free pass to hatred if its only on the internet its stupid to pretend that the online and offline worlds are separate paos gender made her a target from the start and another recently departed reddit employee the chief engineer bethanye blount has suggested that the chief executive was also the victim of the glass cliff a phenomenon where a struggling company decides to appoint a woman either as a last roll of the dice or as a scapegoat to take the blame for its troubles unsurprisingly after repeated waves of harassment pao left reddit the new chief executive steve huffman says he will not reverse her crackdown on offensive forums in fact he wants to go further and create a kind of quarantine zone where coontown and similarly abhorrent groups can be contained with no advertising displayed against such content although he is sure to face resistance huffman has not yet been compared to hitler or kim jongun its almost as if there is some difference between him and pao that means he attracts less obsessive hate from racists and sexists the saga of reddit shows the internet at its worst a place where the loudest angriest and most intolerant voices drown out the rest and where small but committed groups of disgruntled white men lash out against any minorities they perceive to be getting uppity no wonder pao came to a stark conclusion in an article reflecting on her exit from the site the trolls are winning,2015-07,could woman ever affection reddit closest thing internet ha frat house resignation ellen pao interim chief executive linksharing discussion

youd be hardpressed to find a female boss in silicon valley who hasnt faced some sort of harassment but its difficult to imagine that anyone has gotten more hate than former reddit ceo ellen pao from racist chairman pao memes to hate mail and death threats pao has been on the receiving end of some of the worst the internet has to offer indeed in her resignation note on the site pao wrote that some of what shes seen on reddit made me doubt humanity and she urged users to remember the human noting i have a family and i have feelings its clear though that what made pao a target wasnt solely her gender she wasnt just being attacked for being female but for being a feminist as kaliya young founder of shes geeky told the guardian recently ellen was at the center of a highprofile sexual discrimination suit versus a major vc firm and she was put in charge of the teenage boy section of the internet what did you expect was going to happen it was inevitable that they would turn on her pao took a hardline approach against sexism and online harassment during her tenure at reddit under paos leadership the site introduced its first antiharassment policy banned revenge porn and removed five hateful subreddits including rfatpeoplehate and rtransfags now pao is far from the first notable female ceo in silicon valley to deal with sexism when marissa mayer announced her pregnancy the same day she was appointed ceo of yahoo she was both criticized for saying she would only take a few weeks leave and for believing she could run a fortune while parenting after she gave birth she was taken to task for banning telecommuting while building herself an office nursery and at mayers first annual shareholders meeting for yahoo one guy took the microphone to ask mayer a question and said im a dirty old man and you look attractive marissa and facebook coo sheryl sandberg who literally wrote the book on sexism in the workplace kicked off her bestseller lean in with an anecdote about a less explicit kind of sexsim she was giving a presentation at a company when she asked where the womens restroom was a senior partner couldnt give her the answer because she was the only woman to have pitched the company in his time there now neither sandberg nor mayer were heading reddit a space so notorious for its noxious sexism and racism that the southern poverty law center called it the most hateful place on the internet and both are white women largely immune from the racist attacks that pao endures but whats also extremely relevant is that unlike pao their stance on feminism is a little bit more palatable mayer has distanced herself from the term claiming that gender isnt really an issue in tech and while sandberg is one of the most famous women fighting sexism her push for equality is much more about working within the system then well suing it while sandberg is encouraging women to take a seat at the table pao is flipping the table over we need both styles of feminism women taking a more cheerful mainstream approach and women taking names but the less agreeable a womans activism the more likely she is to get taken down for it as sociologist and former reddit moderator katherine cross wrote at feministing outspoken women especially nonwhite women like pao are instant targets if they publicly acknowledge the existence of prejudice worse still if they purport to do something about it there are lots of theories as to why pao resignedwas pushed out and harassment is just one piece of that puzzle but if we want to create change in silicon valley we need more women like pao leaders who are willing to put their asses and jobs on the line for equality,2015-07,youd hardpressed find female bos silicon valley hasnt faced sort harassment difficult imagine anyone ha

as a teenaged feminist in the s trying to educate myself using the internet my favourite material to read wasnt written with me in mind after churning through virtually all the mainstream feminist blogs and websites there werent many in i learned that the most interesting and radical writing was generally done by people that the white liberal feminist establishment considered crazy its not that separatist black womanists the small and besieged contingent of trans activist bloggers or the female feral communist contingent were always right about everything although they were and are right about a lot of things or that there werent thoughtful and challenging feminist writers from white privileged or academic backgrounds rather it was that the tone and political viewpoint of professional or gatekeeperapproved feminist media at the time was simplistic anodyne and selfcentred times have changed a lot since then and mainstream feminism is not as hostile to the ideas of intersectionality or structural analysis as it once was but still i found myself groaning internally when i discovered that lena dunham is launching a feminist lifestyle newsletter for young women we are now drowning in an ocean of feministinflected professionally produced entertainment made to appeal to the sensibilities of young women on one level this is good engaging with pop culture shouldnt have to involve being exposed to a constant barrage of sexism for both men and women engaging with women as narrators and protagonists rather than clumsy male fantasy objects means acknowledging that female perspectives are both different and valuable the increasing diversity of voices in feminist media is also worth applauding dunham says her newsletter lenny will be for an army of likeminded intellectually curious women and the people who love them who want to bring change but also want to know like where to buy the best tube top for summer that isnt going to cost your entire paycheck it will be selffunded at first but eventually be profitable through advertising and affiliate linking goop meets grantland she says but taking a broader view who needs that do young intellectually curious women really require another friendly middlebrow publication that centres their existing concerns and interests fun content of this kind is already everywhere dunham mentions that lenny will involve radical politics but given theres little available evidence to suggest that she herself has engaged with ideas that are particularly challenging im not sure where those ideas will come from mainstream individualist feminism has itself been absorbed into the cultural status quo this is the state of affairs that allowed dunhams particular endeavours to become so popular characterising another product in this vein as new or exciting suggests that dunham has drunk her own koolaid and believes that her ideas and those she finds interesting are what is missing from the offerings currently available the truth is theyre not theyre everywhere the dunhamisation of popular culture is progressing at a rapid clip combined with the increasing homogenisation of internet culture and the dominance of a few powerful online content aggregators its more important than ever to seek out and amplify points of view that speak harsh truths its time to put down the curated feminist content

nsw labor mp jo haylen recently excoriated her party for sexist structures and a culture that denies women equal participation reflecting on her experience in the recent state election she wrote the campaign saw men continue to dominate campaign strategy meetings preparation for key campaign events and decisions involved very few women those in attendance were occasionally explicitly invited for a female perspective despite years of political or policy experience under their belt the existence of their ovaries was their most useful attribute i agree with many of haylens observations what i find ironic is that emilys list the organisation currently pushing the alp national conference to adopt a gender equality rule across all labor party offices and preselections makes womens ovaries a litmus test for determining which women it will support dont get me wrong emilys list has provided assistance to some labor women to secure elected office but emilys list does not support all labor women and this weakens its credibility as the organisation demands gender equality in the labor party emilys list provides fundraising and other support once a woman has been endorsed as a labor candidate but labor endorsement is not sufficient to gain emilys list backing candidates are asked to sign up to a set of further commitments a test applied by the organisation to determine if a woman who successfully won labor party backing now merits theirs most but not all of emilys list requirements for candidates accord with labors progressive principals on the issue of abortion however emilys list only supports women candidates who agree to always support a prochoice position never mind that this is a matter on which the labor party accords its members a conscience vote emilys list makes it a mandatory litmus test fail their test on how women should use their ovaries and you fail to get emilys list support in my time in nsw parliament ive known many female labor mps who were not supported by emilys list the reason was often their unwillingness to sign away their right to a conscience vote on a complex area of law and morality and quite often their views were shaped by their experiences as women this includes mps whose single mothers chose to give birth to them mps who struggled with their fertility or lost babies to stillbirth and miscarriage and mps who have strong personal objections to abortion ive known female mps who are advocates for abortion services and ru but reserve the right to oppose other options like lateterm abortion there are also female mps indeed i was one of them who think abortion should be safe and legal but also rarer than it is today among these women were warriors for equal pay advocates for domestic violence services and womens shelters and champions for girls education some of these women held marginal seats that enabled labor to stay in government delivering services and policies that supported women a few of these women became ministers in labor governments bringing womens voices to the cabinet table yet emilys list deemed them unsupportable and heres a reality check most female mps will spend an entire parliamentary career without needing to vote on or consider the issue of abortion but they will be asked many times to consider child care parental leave domestic violence housing education breast screening ovarian cancer research and equal pay theyll be asked to think about foreign aid when women make up the majority of the worlds poor and sexual slavery a vile commodification of women its not that reproductive rights arent important its that they arent the only important matter a female mp will deal with in her career and abortion shouldnt be given such prominence in determining which women merit support from emilys list if the wider labor party can accommodate mps taking a conscience position on abortion why cant an organisation supporting women in the alp do the same the other litmus test emilys list applies is a factional one this is an often obscured aspect of internal labor politics given that emilys list maintains it is a separate organisation to the labor party but an honest discussion of the proposed rule demands a frank acknowledgment that factional politics infect the way emilys list operates while emilys list does back some women from labors right the organisation is far more likely to approach and engage women from labors left consider that neither i nor the former nsw branch president ursula stephens nor the current nsw assistant general secretary kaila murnain ever received support or encouragement from emilys list and were certainly never asked to contribute to emilys list reforms how can an organisation backing women in the labor party not even acknowledge the three most senior women in our branchs history by looking through a factional lens thats how in nsw the labor womens forum is an organisation run by women in the right and the left to ensure that all labor women particularly those left out by emilys list have access to support from other women in the labor party looking ahead to the national conference i urge all women in the labor party left and right prolife and prochoice emilys list or not to remember this if women only back some women then only some women win but if women back women as the saying goes then all women win,2015-07,nsw labor

when we think about stayathome moms the most common image is one of cheerful suburban women shuttling kids off to soccer games and packing bag lunches women who choose to be at home instead of at work but the truth is far thornier with many women at home not because they want to be but because they have to be something to which hillary clinton seemed attuned as she called for more women in the workforce on monday as part of her economic vision for the future clinton has been pushing left on worklife issues so it was no surprise that she cited family leave closing the wage gap and access to affordable quality childcare as key to a building a stronger economy and narrowing gender inequalities but clinton also said she wants more women working in the public sphere saying we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines she continued the united states used to rank seventh out of advanced countries in womens labor force participation by wed dropped to th that represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and american families to prioritize putting more women in the workforce shouldnt be controversial but in a culture that still tells women that the most important job title theyll ever hold is mother and with republicans at the ready to skewer anyone who hints at anything but pure reverence for women who stay at home clintons message is actually quite subversive by plainly saying that she wants more women at work the presidential hopeful is taking on the american fantasy that the majority of stayathome moms are there by choice while some moms who stay home to take care of children may label this decision as a choice we cant really call it such when the alternative may be spending an exorbitant amount of money on childcare the longheld notion that stayathome moms are highly educated women who simply opted out of highpowered and wellpaid careers is largely a myth according to a pew study a third of stayathome moms live in poverty and of single stayathome moms live below the poverty level and nearly half of women who stay at home with children have a high school diploma or less as bryce covert wrote last year these financial hardships and barriers are likely part of why a growing share of stayathome mothers are out of the workforce because they cant find a job why its always womens salaries that are considered expendable for the family good is a whole different story its not just mothers who are out of work of course according to the bureau of labor statistics while the labor participation rate of men over years old is about its only for women the face of unemployed americans is a distinctly female one in her speech clinton said we should be making it easier for americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers part of doing that is as clinton laid out ensuring equal pay fair family leave and affordable childcare but its also dismantling the myth that women would largely rather be at home than at work yes we love our children and many of us moms do want more flexibility and family leave but we also want to get paid and we want real choices women are a necessary and vital part of the workforce whose contribution to the public good goes beyond raising children and as clinton said these are not just womens issues theyre american ones,2015-07,think stayathome mom common image one cheerful

guardian coverage of remarks by sir tim hunt the nobel prize winner to a group of women scientists about his trouble with girls has been criticised by some readers an editorial was one area of readers concerns it was published three weeks after he made the remarks to a world conference of science journalists in south korea that eventually led to his resignation from his honorary post at university college london prof hunt said at that conference three things happen when women are in the lab you fall in love with them they fall in love with you and when you criticise them they cry the editorial published on july begins it is three weeks since sir tim hunt a nobel prize winner shared his sexist opinion of female scientists distractingly sexy prone to weep when criticised and best segregated at work with a room full of science writers within hours of his afterdinner speech he had gone this bitter mix of resentments amplified by the polarising environment of social media should have met a calmer official response but the professor still had to go one reader wrote can i beg you to examine whether the second editorial yesterday fell seriously below the standards we used to expect from the guardian the leader was so tendentious it was unbelievable for your editorial to say that one possibly misjudged joke comprehensively undermined his reputation as a leading supporter of female scientists is simply silly it ought to have been treated with more nuance and less easy repetition of prejudice and sloppy thought one reader who makes clear that he has known and worked with prof hunt wrote a measured response is required regrettably however your own response the editorial is not measured the aim of this column is to address the issues about coverage not to express an opinion about prof hunts remarks the problems with coverage came before the editorial was published in an opinion piece by connie st louis the senior science journalism lecturer who tweeted prof hunts remarks igniting the controversy she was responding in an online article published on june to a number of leading scientists who had publicly defended prof hunt however an unedited version of her article was published in error which was immediately spotted by readers was it even subbed its hard to believe the guardian published it in its current form unfortunately we did but then edited it live when the mistake was discovered if basic style and grammar errors are spotted and corrected within hours of a piece being published we would not usually add a footnote however on this occasion we should have done so as such is the controversy surrounding the story at least one commentator thought the absence of a footnote might be significant it wasnt moving on to the editorial there were two objective factual errors in it the editorial incorrectly referred to the presocialmedia era dumping of robin cook it also claimed that alastair campbell telephoned the labour foreign secretary at the airport calling on him to choose between his job and his lover an allegation denied by campbell in a letter to the guardian cook was not dumped over his affair but resigned several years later over the iraq war the second error in the editorial is as suggested above that the offending remarks by prof hunt were not made at an afterdinner speech but during a prelunch toast i am not sure this counts as a substantial inaccuracy but an afterdinner speech does gives the impression of something prepared beforehand that was more thoughtful and considered rather than an offthecuff joke now publicly regretted by prof hunt as being thoughtless however even these judgments may be seen as valueladen an alternative view may be that it merely reveals what lurks in the unconscious editorials are there to express the views of the newspaper an opinion but it should be a collective opinion in that context i think it would have been reasonable to describe prof hunt as making a sexist remark he admits it was wrong even if it was meant to be ironic but it is a stretch to say that he shared his sexist opinion of female scientists is it right to infer a mans whole character from one remark where the guardian had it right is in the heart of the leader in the penultimate paragraph all the same the surge of support shows how widely misunderstood the pressing need for feminist activism still is particularly in science according to the latest evidence women occupy just of jobs in science technology and engineering in research women earn less are less likely to be promoted and win fewer awards

your correspondents call on the director of public prosecutions to affirm her commitment to eliminating intimate violence against human beings of any gender and criticise the crown prosecution services presentation of statistics in its annual violence against women and girls report for being so explicitly gendered letters july it is established fact that these crimes are massively disproportionately committed against women and girls female genital mutilation exclusively so and that they are related to womens broader inequality with men your correspondents claim without citation that one in six of all victims are male this is disputed and certainly does not apply equally to all the forms of abuse in the cps report eminent sociologist professor sylvia walby was recently reported in this newspaper calling for an overhaul of the current methods of recording violent crime which are leading to gross understatement of the proportion directed at women report june furthermore it is also critical that we retain gender in our naming and analysis of these crimes because of the gender of the perpetrators whom your correspondents do not mention at all many male victims of domestic violence and the vast majority of men and boys who suffer sexual violence are abused by men we need to understand who these men are why they choose to do what they do how they target their victims by preying on other inequalities including age sexuality and social class and the gendered excuses for violence and abuse if we are ever to eradicate it over the last few years the cps has brought together its reporting on the prosecution of crimes of violence against women and girls in recognition that there is a serious justice deficit in relation to them this contributes to impunity and ultimately perpetrators confidence that they will get away with their crimes as shown powerfully in the rotherham child sexual exploitation inquiry report the cps report enables us to hold the prosecution service to account for the efforts it then makes to improve these justice outcomes the uks lack of a consistent and coherent approach to tackling violence against women was criticised in an official report on the uk by un special rapporteur rashida manjoo recently who also raised a concern about a shift from gender specificity to gender neutrality in searching for recognition and then for justice and support for male survivors of abuse it is a grave mistake to suggest taking gender out of the naming and analysis and neutralising these crimes into orwellian intimate abuse a failure to name and call out the abuse of power in these crimes is what kept them invisible for so long baljit banga newham asian womens project sara browne iranian ad kurdish womens

a surge in calls for help from women fleeing family violence has prompted the victorian government to allocate m to frontline response services the funding announced on tuesday includes m over four years for domestic violence victoria and towards improving responses for indigenous victims of family violence data from victoria police shows indigenous australians represented of family violence victims last year despite making up just of the states population the minister for housing martin foley told guardian australia there had been enormous growth in women seeking help since the government announced it would hold a royal commission into family violence the commission will begin its public hearings on monday when experts and stakeholders will discuss how family violence can be prevented the fact there is more attention on the issue and recognition of its importance has encouraged more women to come forward often women with children and frontline services advocacy organisations and community groups have reported a very significant increase in demand on services foley said so weve allocated some funding to respond to this growth and it is meant to be just an initial response to growing demand the funding was announced at the new headquarters for the aboriginal family violence prevention and legal service in the melbourne suburb of abbotsford its chief executive antoinette braybrook said with support from a victoria legal aid innovation grant she hoped to develop the building into a culturally safe tailormade and holistic centre where indigenous survivors of family violence could access services our community hub will celebrate aboriginal culture while providing practical support in areas covering a range of legal issues family violence education early intervention and prevention among others she said an australian institute of health and welfare report released last month showed indigenous australian women were taken to hospital for assault injuries at times the rate of nonindigenous women the chief executive of domestic violence victoria fiona mccormack thanked the government for recognising the critical role of a family

another week and another silicon valleysized maelstrom ellen pao chief executive of reddit the social news forum that bills itself as the front page of the internet but is increasingly known for misogyny and porn is under fire again this time it follows the sudden departure of a popular employee at the site which prompted volunteer moderators to shut down hundreds of communities sorry subreddits in protest reddit has been thrown into chaos and although pao has apologised for letting down users a petition calling for her removal set up earlier this year by members unhappy at the companys attempts to ban communities for harassing behaviour has gained more than signatures over the weekend why is the world so angry with pao could it be because she is a woman in a position of power or is it infinitely more complicated it goes back to the sex discrimination lawsuit that pao brought against venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield and byers in march the landmark trial that captivated silicon valley for a month included details about allmale ski trips and valentines gifts and prompted former employees at twitter and facebook to file similar suits in the process paos personal life work habits and emails were raked through the court she was accused of being aggressive timid greedy manipulative and so on you could say that the courtroom isnt so different to the boardroom even though she lost the jury sided with kleiner perkinss case that pao was divisive and not a team player the case shone a light on the lack of diversity in silicon valley since the trial pao has become either the reckless ceo intent on destroying the freedom of the internet or the tech generations figurehead for speaking out against gender discrimination in the workplace depending on who you talk to if ive helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital then the battle was worth it she told reporters outside the courtroom back in march her move to reddit at first glance seemed incongruous maybe that was the point after taking on silicon valley where only of senior investing partners at venture capital firms are women could it be that pao wanted to clean up what some regard as the biggest online mess of them all reddit as well as being a breeding ground for memes and gifs has a reputation sometimes hard to square with site users used to its different face for being a toxic misogynistic community a chineseamerican feminist in charge thats really interesting its worth noting one complication the employee fired by reddit is a woman but pao was already in the limelight and has a reputation for taking on sexual discrimination in the six months since she has been in post pao has removed negotiating over cash salaries and equity from reddits recruitment process because she felt men benefited more than women its an opportunity for me to try to put in things that i think are going to create this equal opportunity environment for everyone she said she has banned involuntary pornography by ensuring people whose photos have been posted on reddit without their consent can have them removed and the company has introduced an antiharassment policy were banning behaviour not ideas its not exactly shocking yet pao is accused of waging a war on freedom the response to introducing some basic principles of respect and tolerance to a site used by more than million people every month has been tellingly disproportionate in fact the language of the petition to oust pao says it all a vast majority of the reddit community believes that pao a manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top has overstepped the boundaries and fears that she will run reddit into the ground some might say the boundaries should have been overstepped long ago,2015-07,another week another silicon valleysized maelstrom ellen pao chief executive reddit social news forum bill front page internet increasingly known misogyny porn fire time

as a transgender man allan says he had nowhere to go when his relationship became violent and a partner would beat him up and force him to have sex with men for money there were times when the violence got too much for me and i thought i was living in a bad dream i lost my job car home and had no money said yearold allan at the time allan was female the sex he was assigned at birth but he says he has always identified as a man allan moved to san francisco to get away from what he says was an abusive relationship and take refuge at the san francisco asian womens shelter one of the first and few shelters in the us that offers a specific program and a trained social worker for gay and transgender victims of domestic violence which is often called intimate partner violence there has been a steady increase of intimate partner violence in the lgbt community and the rates are higher than of hate violence towards lgbt but we still dont have enough support services to help people get out of violent relationships said chai jindasurat codirector of community organizing and public advocacy at the national coalition of antiviolence programs ncavp a new york citybased national organization working to reduce violence and its impact on lgbt individuals in the us by april ncavp had recorded lgbt homicides for the year eight of the incidents were reportedly intimate partner family or sexual violencerelated and six were hate or police violencerelated in ncavps local partner organizations received reports of intimate partner violence ipv a slight increase from the reports received in the ncavp documented intimate partner homicides in which is equal to the homicides in but more than three times the six ipvrelated homicides in also in the centers for disease control and prevention cdc released the national intimate partner and sexual violence survey which detailed data about sexual assaults that occurred in and broke it down by sexual orientation it was the first national survey estimating how prevalent intimate partner violence sexual violence and stalking are among people who are lesbian gay or bisexual in the us it found four in lesbian women six in bisexual women and one in three heterosexual womenreported experiencing rape physical violence or stalking within the context of an intimate partner relationship at least once during their lifetime the cdc data also shows that four out of gay men half of bisexual men and one in five heterosexual men in the us have experienced sexual violence other than rape at some point in their lives the cdc survey didnt address violence in transgender relationships jindasurat says people in such relationships face increasing hate violence and intimate partner violence there arent any specific domestic violence shelters or housing support for lgbt individuals in most of the country but especially here in san francisco where the community is very big said carolina morales codirector of community united against violence cuav a counselling and support center that has been working with survivors of domestic violence in the lgbt community in san francisco since morales says that she routinely receives complaints from lgbt individuals who have been turned away at the domestic violence shelters in san francisco when they are allowed into some traditional domestic violence shelters oftentimes the shelter staff dont have the training to work with lgbt individuals or the other housemates call them names and look down on them said morales who has been with cuav since hediana utarti runs the queer asian women and transgender support program at the san francisco asian womens shelter she worked with allan during his recovery and supported him during his transition she says that the shelter receives more than calls a year on its domestic violence call line and about a year from lgbt individuals i think there are more lgbt victims of domestic violence but they need specific services just for them because when they call a help line they want to speak to someone who doesnt assume that their abuser is the opposite sex and understands their situation said utarti she says that allan was fearless in that he immediately said in his group therapy sessions that his abuser was a woman but that most lesbian bisexual or transgender women hide that their abuser is a woman because they fear the homophobic attitudes and responses of the other women in the shelters the shelter has five rooms and can house women at one time utarti admits that this isnt enough to meet the demand of heterosexual survivors of domestic violence let alone the lgbt individuals that they get calls from she and morales say that for many lgbt survivors of domestic violence the most helpful resource is transitional housing services especially in san franciscos expensive housing rental market the services could include support to find and pay for an individual apartment or studio for three months to a year while the individual goes through counselling especially in the case of highly vulnerable individuals many lgbt survivors of domestic violence are already facing high levels of discrimination but transgender women of color are extremely vulnerable to violence and have the least access to legal health and financial resources said morales they are also less likely to seek help from their parents or other family members than other survivors of domestic violence allan says that during the time he was in the violent relationship with his partner he was an undocumented mexican immigrant and barely spoke english a few times i called the police on my partner but i had no way of telling them my side of the story after arriving at the san francisco asian womens shelter allan began learning english and with the help of utarti obtained a us visa specifically to protect victims of sexual trafficking other lgbt survivors of domestic violence say that there arent enough support groups for them nor enough accessible therapists who understand the power dynamics and the nuances of violence in gay or transgender relationships i am physically bigger and stronger than my partner but she is the abusive one said a yearold lesbian woman who lives in san francisco and didnt want to give her full name for privacy reasons the power dynamics are very different in gay relationships and you cant apply the traditional domestic violence assumptions or treatments,2015-07,transgender man allan say nowhere go relationship became violent partner would beat force sex men money time

what is it with women and apologies im sorry to say that we do it too much this week the novelist sloane crosley wrote in the new york times about her fascination with saying sorry unnecessarily women she wrote are by far the most apologetic gender an observation prompted by her own triple apology in a restaurant when she was served a salad covered in dirt of course the gritty salad was not her fault but she still felt the need to express regret for not eating it for complaining about it and then for rejecting the wrong replacement salad crosley argues that saying sorry is the female act of revolt its a passiveaggressive defence mechanism designed to shame someone else into realising that they are the one who should have said sorry and brought a better salad in the first place she sees womens use of sorry as a verbal tic its the trojan horse for genuine annoyance men are not immune either though she adds in particular british men i can report from the field that she is right for the past six months ive been previewing my edinburgh show say sorry to the lady across the uk i have asked hundreds of people from loch lomond to tunbridge wells to fill in ministry of apology cards with their anonymous apologies and also crucially requests for apologies the idea is to get it all out in the open so we can be done with this sorry business once and for all though the cards are unsigned the gender of the respondents is often obvious and there is a sharp divide between men and women men apologise jokily women take it seriously men use it as an opportunity to mess around women want revenge psychologists have long since established that women use apology for a variety of reasons mostly to smooth social tension before any tension has even arisen perhaps its an almost maternal way of making everyone feel at ease or maybe its a coded message that says dont mind me im a doormat which is why this nonsense must stop theres the female preemptive apology that assumes mounting anger in the other person for instance sorry im late when youre not even that late this allows the other person to take a higher status and establish that youre not a challenge to them theres the awkwardnessavoidance apology sorry did you want to sit down when someone clearly wants to sit but is too nervous to ask and theres the classic sloane crosley unnecessary apology sorry is there something gross in my food when you know there is something gross in your food this is not an apology its a nonassertive complaint why not just complain interestingly under the anonymous guise of the ministry of apology both genders have seemed equally keen to link politics and apology apologies have been demanded from ed miliband because it didnt work nigel farage because you have ruined the colour purple for everyone michael gove because of everything george osborne no explanation necessary and david cameron variations on see you next tuesday and shut the front door for some reason sebastian coe came in for a particularly brutal kicking in tunbridge wells in bath a father expressed regret about a lie that got out of hand sorry for telling my son i was the lead singer in the kinks in stepney a german man expressed contrition because of the guy fighting mr churchill in leicester a man apologised to paul mccartney for thinking he was dead whats interesting though is the fervour always from women of the demand for apologies they want it to be someone elses turn to say sorry women are done with apologising this is payback time so many women asked for extra id like to demand cards in brighton that i ran out crosley argues that the many sorrys of women are taking up valuable time that could be spent relaying accurate impressions of what we want the ministry of apology cards suggest that what women want most of all is for other people to say sorry to them more frequently ideally at the point of insult the apologetic worm is turning the trouble is that regardless of gender when we do get a sorry we dont believe it as was expressed in teddington i want an apology from nick clegg still because he didnt mean it the first time an inadequate apology is surely the soilflecked radicchio leaf of british public life it lingers on the palate long after it has been returned to the kitchen but please dont apologise for sending that crap back particularly

as a stayathome mum i can safely say i feel no guilt about choosing to abandon my professional career in order to look after my three children working mothers dont need to feel guilt june any guilt that working or stayathome mothers have is a result of a society that constantly peddles the belief that us mums can have it all we cant and we have to make difficult choices that usually result in us feeling that we have sacrificed either spending time with our children by working or our own education and career by not working and these are the women that actually have a choice many do not and end up working hours that arent childfriendly while plugging the gaps in childcare with partners grandparents and friends what women would really like is to have a genuine choice whether to work or stay at home with no stigma attached to either this means an economy that pays a wage enough to live on without both parents needing to work and consistently sympathetic employers that can offer flexible working hours our society needs to start respecting women who stay at home with their children and appreciate that a womans contribution to society is not necessarily immediately financially assessable my life since leaving the world of work three years ago is one of sorting the children out looking after the house being a school governor helping the pta going on school trips attending school information sessions and events socialising and even reading the guardian now and again it is as fulfilling as any job could be and none of it is paid i consider myself extremely lucky and guiltfree dr julia williams shrewsbury shropshire when i was a young girl my mother a stayathome mum would tell me over and over that if i wanted to follow my dreams and have choices i needed to get a college degree and learn how to drive she wanted me to be safe happy successful that is what we all want for our children we are however losing sight of what success is humanity is working hard to allow individuals to live creatively and joyfully rather than simply working to survive a full life includes laughter play love if my children make less money than their peers but are not plagued by depression and stress if they go to sleep giggling and know the incomparable warmth of a little body melting into theirs in complete trust and dependency i will be deliriously happy they will have succeeded it is not that career success is unimportant or unnecessary far from it it is simply that it is not the whole picture to have only a career and barely enough energy to see your child is not a true choice so to dr allen daughters of working mothers do better in life and sons may be more caring too june and her concern that women who dont work have to think hard about how the role they have within the household is going to impact their childrens perceptions of what it means to be a woman and to be a mother id like to answer i hope my being at home will signal to my children that loving them enjoying them and enjoying myself is more important than an extra i hope it tells them that women and all people are more than workers we work to live we dont live to work i hope it tells them that we must fight for real choice for a society that values caring and structures paid work so that both women and men can participate in caring and thus be truly fulfilled successful humans and by the way i followed my mothers advice dr karem roitman oxford i was delighted to see alice okeeffe write that the left should stand up for stayathome parents theguardiancom june the right has certainly cast adrift parents who wish not to use thirdparty care for their children and it is becoming a revolutionary and firmly feminist concept to imagine that equality is not only achieved via full participation in the paid workplace in the uk the work of caring for children goes completely unrecognised in the tax system unlike the vast majority of oecd countries and unpaid care is valued at bn per year by the ons someone needs to stand up for these people who contribute billions to the economy every year but nothing to gdp and therefore have no value when one parent opts to leave paid work in order to care for and support a growing family it costs a whole salary meanwhile families on two substantial incomes can continue to claim child benefit long after the singleincome family has lost theirs and they pay far less tax this is not about somehow indulging cupcakebaking mummies this is about levelling the playing field so that individual families can make sensible choices about what is good for them over the entire period of having dependent children at home melanie tibbs shaftesbury dorset alice okeefe airs some important issues increasingly late modern western society defines women as indeed women define themselves through rolesachievements external to motherhood it is for these roles they are rewarded and valorised by society for life roles are about tangible and presenttime outcomes what have i achievedam achieving how is this manifested in my career progresssalary and how good am i at juggling the different elements of my life parenting on the other hand is and has ever been a futureoriented enterprise its not about product but process therefore raising a child in whatever context of care arrangement must be about parents grasp of the connectedness of different elements of a young life the most critical being the first three years and the ways in which early experiences can significantly affect later life as daniel barenboim recently pointed out its the total structure that matters in life as in music parents and expectant parents would do well to inform themselves about this connectedness to help with this they might access the latest findings from neuroscience concerning infant brain development highlighting ways of ensuring and securing emotional health in youngsters they could start by taking a look at the research summaries on whataboutthechildrenorguk and my facebook item motherhood challenging the zeitgeist parents in general need much greater valuing and support than is currently available to them and childrens needs should be at the forefront of all our concerns both in policy as in practice dr carole ulanowsky nottingham my eldest daughter has just turned ever since i became a mother i have striven to read the guardian every day all that time there have been conflicting articles about the value or not of going out of the house to work when my mother was forced out of teaching in her increasing resentment at this treatment was a permanent feature of my childhood after i arrived in the notion of her returning to work when i was small was impossible how i wish she had left us with a childminder when my daughter was born i was given a choice whether to return to teaching or stay at home i am grateful for this option of course it was wrong but when i married my salary could not be taken into account however it enabled me to do what i wanted i could stay and bring up our four children before returning to teaching my children do not have this luxury i deeply resent the assertion by the academic quoted that because i did this i was giving my children the wrong message they all went to good universities with subsequent good careers i was never bored in part with thanks to the guardian mary

it is simply untrue to say about cases concerning violence against women and girls were prosecuted over the past monthsreport june responsibility for this error however lies not with your staff but with the crown prosecution service and its report misleadingly entitled violence against women and girls crime report despite the title this analysis included more than male victims of crimes including rape sexual assault child abuse and domestic violence many will have been gay or transgender many will have had their children or dependents affected designating them as victims of crimes against women and girls not only misleads the public about the complex and diverse dynamics of abuse but also serves to conceal and marginalise the experiences of all male survivors of intimate and sexual crimes while perpetuating the myth that real men dont get raped abused or become victims of domestic violence victims of intimate violence face significant psychological barriers to reporting these events some fear they will not be believed or even that they may be cast as the perpetrator those who find the courage to report their abuse to the authorities often say they are motivated less by the need for justice or revenge but for validation that what happened to them was real and was wrong many men tell us that the experience of intimate violation has left them feeling like less than a man making interaction with authorities even more complex and challenging for those authorities to publicly disregard this and erase the experiences of one in six of all victims is unjust and a cruel betrayal of their bravery we fully support drives to eliminate intimate and sexual violence and understand that focusing on female victims is central to this it is also essential that we retain due consideration for male victims of these crimes we call on the director of public prosecutions alison saunders and all public bodies to affirm their commitment to addressing and eliminating intimate violence against human beings of any gender and to take care not to compromise the dignity and public understanding of any survivors ally fogg writer and journalist michael may director

yesterday the term manspreading was added to the online oxford dictionary it made the news and i felt surprisingly pissed off about it on the way to work i counted three women participating in fine examples of manspreading ever since i was a teenager it has always irritated me that sitting with your legs open was seen to be the preserve of men it seemed to be based on the outmoded assumption that women always wear skirts and that even in trousers they should be making themselves small and polite in public spaces in an admittedly minor rebellion i started to sit like that too of course i dont think anyone should ever stop someone else from sitting on a train because they need space for their own knees but frankly when theres room its pretty comfortable to sit with your legs open just be goodmannered about it then yesterdays win for the term manspreading made me think that even when a man or woman is doing it in an irritating way when the body language isnt exactly endearing the word describing this seated position has become unnecessarily gendered there are obviously bigger feminist battles to be fought and i write this very aware of the brilliantly feminist roots of manspreading and the need to highlight an action men feel entitled to and women often feel they cant do squishing women on the tube isnt cool other manprefixed words work the same way i laughed in recognition reading rebecca solnits essay men explain things to me which later inspired the term mansplaining and i too have been the victim of manterrupting others cite the scourge of mandermining though i cant say ive experienced manslamming when men refuse to move out of the way on a crowded pavement these terms are a useful and often funny way to point out behaviours that have become the norm for men in our working and social lives shutting out womens voices and their physical presence often aggressively you just need to look at the language of internet trolls for an example of all this women occasionally explain things patronisingly to me but men do it more often and they think its more acceptable too in the end though it seems to me that the man prefix compounds the idea that men are aggressive and women are always pleasing always good never in the way and that they cant act up sometimes themselves their knees always remain where they are meant to be while assertive behaviour is still only associated with men if as a woman you indulge in manspreading mansplaining or any other type of man action youre not just doing something irritating youre doing something unfeminine too these terms have a really important function to point out acts which silence women but they risk reinforcing the supposed differences between men and women theres a danger that though helpful now in the long run they could start to shame women as well as the men they are aimed at if my leg spreading annoys you then tell me off for what it is whether im male or female language has power and despite the feminist intentions of the word my yearold self is unsure about having manspreading preserved in the annals of the oxford dictionary even if it was just the online

in america advocates for introducing paid parental leave often frame it as a national economic priority and theyre right about the benefits happier employees mean lower turnover rates and putting more money into the pockets of working families may increase consumption paying parents to take care of their kids improves the odds that they will return to the labor market after childbirth which boosts labor force participation this shows that federal and state governments ought not worry about the costs of introducing paid leave but the positive economic effects are neither necessary nor sufficient reasons to do it worryingly framing parental leave as an economic issue distracts from the health and social benefits that really matter for instance a paper published in april in the journal of political economy revealed that when norway introduced paid parental leave the reform made parents spend more time with their kids which made the latter less likely to drop out of high school the effect was largest for kids whose parents prior to the reform would take very low levels of unpaid leave financially assisting parents who want to spend time with their newborns is also a good way to improve childrens health a study of family leave schemes in rich countries over four decades found that paid leave significantly reduced infant mortality by contrast leave policies that were either unpaid or did not offer job protection had no such impact the health effects of paid leave for children can be explained by a host of factors when parents can take time off work to be with their kids without pressure of foregone income and risk of losing their jobs they will be less stressed and more engaged mothers are more likely to breastfeed and both parents can more easily make sure that their children get medical care nutritious food and exercise in addition to prioritizing paid leave as a national economic priority rather than a childwelfare one its also often perceived strictly as a womens issue feminists who argue that the absence of paid leave policies in part is a result of the patriarchal notion that women are best suited for household work may have a point but its to the detriment of all to exclude men from the equation an investigation of leave schemes across countries found that parental leave helped fathers build closer relationships with their kids paternity leave has also been found to reduce alcohol consumption presumably because promoting caregiving results in leading a more responsible life overall surveys also show that paternity leave leads to less unequal division of domestic chores and fewer household conflicts perhaps then it is not surprising that fathers who take parental leave tend to have lower mortality rates in the united states a recent trend among tech companies is to offer their employees more generous paid leave this is great news regrettably however these policies tend to favor either a primary caregiver which typically is a woman or the mother specifically which by definition is a woman but more equal childrearing is in the best interest of both women and men as so often is the case gender equality is good for men too and paid leave is no exception i do not deny all the positive effects that introducing paid parental leave may have on womens empowerment and the national economy but the economic impact is not that important after all i think most of us would still advocate for paid leave even if research were to find that such a policy causes a drop in gdp or a reduction in laborforce participation and although helping women have both a family and a career is absolutely crucial presenting it solely as a womens issue risks giving the false impression that men have nothing to gain which makes it so much harder to win support for a muchneeded policy change paid parental leave is a mens and a childrens issue too and we men need to step up and make that clear,2015-08,america advocate introducing paid parental

when i was a young feminist working at my first job in a womens nonprofit and eager to singlehandedly take on the patriarchy there was a common refrain from the older generation that infuriated me and my peers where are all the young feminists we were right there fetching coffee and making photocopies to help the cause and yet wed hear over and over again that young women simply werent interested in the movement the idea that young people are politically apathetic on feminist issues has always been a myth of course but today only the most outoftouch person could claim as much over the weekend yearold actress rowan blanchard star of disneys girl meets world wrote a thoughtful and smart essay posted to instagram on the importance of intersectional feminism feminism that takes into account how oppression impacts different people depending on their identity she wrote the way a black woman experiences sexism and inequality is different from the way a white woman experiences sexism and inequality likewise with transwomen and hispanic women while white women are making cents to the dollar native american women are making cents black women are making cents and hispanic women are making cents blanchard also cited academic kimberl crenshaw discussed transphobia and police violence against women of color in other words she rocked it and the world noticed the media jubilant that such a young woman could articulate such nuanced feminist ideas but while blanchard is clearly incredibly sharp and knowledgeable shes not an outlier a new generation of young feminists who came of age online are tremendously more informed than their internetless predecessors whereas women my age and older were lucky to hear nominal mention of the feminist movement during womens history month at school the likes of susan b anthony and gloria steinem all young women and girls today need to do is log on to tumblr or do a google search and all of feminism is at their fingertips blogs and twitter accounts memes and youtube channels within moments young people can watch a talk between bell hooks and melissa harrisperry or take part in an online protest and while the media continues to ask female celebrities of all ages if they identify as feminists as some sort of zeitgeisty litmus test young people like blanchard are using their fame to push the conversation forward rather than let someone else control the narrative take hunger games actress amandla stenberg who published a video on cultural appropriation that went viral and has pushed back against racist stereotypes stenberg told dazed that social justice has always been incredibly important to me but it wasnt until recently that i realized i could use my platform to start conversations stenberg also told fellow young feminist tavi gevinson founder of rookie that it was reading the online magazine that in part sparked her interest in feminism we should continue to applaud young and teenage feminists who are speaking out about complicated and serious issues but lets not not treat them as anomalies theyre representative of younger people both men and women who care about social and political justice theyre younger than we are theyre smarter than we were and theyre certainly more informed so lets leave the headpats at home and fetch our own coffee and instead focus on what we can learn from what will certainly be the most brilliant feminist generation,2015-08,wa young feminist working first job womens nonprofit eager singlehandedly take patriarchy wa common refrain older generation infuriated peer

the labour party has an incredible record on womens rights we played a pivotal role in giving women the vote and passing the sex discrimination and equal pay acts labours allwomen shortlists have meant there are now more women mps in the house of commons than ever before of labour to the tories more in the scottish parliament labour to snp and more in the welsh assembly labour to plaid cymru a majority of labour meps are women and scottish labour members have just elected kezia dugdale as their new leader even after a terrible election defeat labour can still proudly boast more women mps at westminster than all the other parties combined if we are truly a party of equality how ironic would it be if we ended up with an allmale leadership team there are nine people standing in the elections for labour leader and deputy leader for the first time ever a majority are women with five females standing in two contests there are possible combinations of leader and deputy leader that involve at least one woman what sort of message would it send if we still couldnt elect a woman to one of our leadership positions having women in our leadership is about more than symbolism women bring a different experience to politics my candidature for deputy leader is a case in point in my mids i was on my own with two children under two so i know what its like to be on benefits to worry about money to need a job childcare and a secure roof over your head as a young mum i joined the workplace nurseries campaign later becoming chair and we successfully persuaded the tory government to stop taxing workplace nurseries when i was elected in i took that experience into parliament founding and chairing the first ever allparty childcare group which paved the way for its first workplace nursery for all staff as a labour grassroots activist and feminist i supported modernising candidate selections from one member one vote omov to allwomen shortlists as a woman from a workingclass background i have no doubt that omov helped me to become the first woman in years to be selected in don valley i originally joined labour when i was never imagining that i would become an mp my background as the daughter of a teenage lone parent didnt mark me out for political office ive never felt entitled and still have to work hard to prove myself who i am coupled with my passion for equality and social mobility drives me to ensure that labour looks and sounds like the country we aspire to govern we need more elected black and minority ethnic bame women disabled women lgbt women and workingclass women as deputy leader ill level the playing field for candidates so that money and connections are no advantage in selections the best guarantee of progress for womens rights is having more women elected as councillors meps and mps and in leadership roles throughout our party ultimately whether or not we end up with an allmale leadership team is in the hands of labour party members and supporters yet in more than years since its formation labour has had women in its leadership for only of those years over what seems like an endless summer questions about who should and shouldnt take part in the vote what clothes make a woman a leader and the ramifications of two men being voted in have all received ample coverage but the real question is will labour revert to its

have you ever let a sexist remark go unchallenged at work most women id wager have what about several comments what in fact would or could you do if you found your workplace culture was steeped in sexism this autumn marks five years since the equality act was passed an allencompassing bill taking in older acts concerning pay race gender and disability discriminations making our right to work free from prejudice enshrined in the law the tricky part is that its often hard to implement with the lack of an obvious offence its often a case of being crushed by a thousand tiny microaggressions they can be hard to prove both to an employer and to yourself contributing to a feeling of slowburning madness am i imagining this can this be a problem with me or the other person to preserve sanity its often easier to quit a job than deal with the labourintensive process of pursuing a grievance but not being able to impact on a toxic workplace environment to subvert and change from within can be a concern that many women share when leaving a sexist workplace compounding the feeling of failure on leaving is the awareness that remaining or future female employees will face the same treatment charlotte songhurst not her real name taught pe at a secondary school in the southeast from to she returned from maternity leave to find her department dominated by a new male teacher who had helped foster a culture of sexist jokes and bad language songhurst claims that he was unable to take orders from female colleagues leading to a standoff between the two where he shouted and physically intimidated her she quit i felt id let myself down by not challenging it she says now im older and stronger i wish i had done more but at the time i was broken he systematically chipped away at me many women i spoke to about why they left sexist workplaces never spoke out for themselves or their successors thanks to a suffocating combination of imposter syndrome feelings of professional inadequacy despite evidence of your accomplishments the potential of being dismissed for being emotional and fear of upsetting an established workplace culture often they would be reporting to femaledominated hr departments that would report to maledominated senior management leading to weak responses to their complaints the selfpreservation act of leaving is curdled by a sense of desertion for letting the status quo stand earlier this year mel chillag worked at a leading supermarket in the northeast and describes an air of general misogyny among her predominantly male colleagues jokes about rape and murder sexist and demeaning comments about their girlfriends i came on shift one night to find an article pinned up discussing comments from the companys ceo encouraging fat employees to lose weight so they looked more attractive to customers and were able to work more efficiently she says i had to assume this was a passive aggressive attack on me due to being the only fat person working there as a newcomer chillag felt uncomfortable raising the issue she finally got the opportunity at a review but was left feeling unsupported eventually she decided to leave once the relief subsided she experienced a sense of guilt and disappointment that i didnt do more to challenge the culture she recalls i left without saying a word and i have no doubt that unchallenged the perpetrators will continue to speak about women with total disdain it should have been my duty to be the one who spoke out the danger is that women internalise this kind of responsibility dr elisabeth kelan professor of leadership at cranfield school of management finds that women leaving sexist workplaces often deny discrimination preferring to regard themselves as the problem were always told its our skill our ability she says emphasising the importance of recognising that so much work is based on this behaviour that excludes others sophie asked to withhold her surname in her experience female employees were often burdened with the responsibility of managing their aggressor her digital role at a charity threatened a male employee whose behaviour escalated from pointedly ignoring her to taking a red pen to her job description in a meeting organised by hr a thirdparty mediator concluded that he had a problem with women the company paid for him to have counselling and gave him an assistant while sophies direct manager suggested she sit down with the perpetrator for a cup of tea she too quit its in my nature to be someone who wants to fix things so that led to a lot of guilt and selfdoubt she says is it me am i just shit at my job i felt guilt for the girl who started as his assistant she flashed up on linkedin and i wondered if i should contact her i didnt dr jo grady a lecturer in human resource management at the university of leicester school of management is concerned by the guilt that women leaving these workplaces feel there is a lot of empowerment literature that would suggest that individual behaviours can help overcome power structures when it comes to gender in the workplace she says theres only an extent to which that will ever be successful her research concerns organisations being structured around heteropatriarchal values the idea of a heterosexual fulltime worker who enters the market at a certain period in time and doesnt have many career breaks is what most hr departments base their idealised worker on never mind antidiscrimination legislation the system she says is rigged in mens favour ruth cornish founder of hr consultancy amelore suggests harnessing any widespread dissatisfaction to make a collective grievance though she says making your move after leaving can be powerful meeting with company directors or engaging an external party who doesnt have to deal with the resulting office politics to make ceos aware of poor practice though she acknowledges that comes at a personal cost she estimates that of her clientele want to improve life for their successors men too aggrieved by inflexibility or macho environments the key to doing so is identifying an organisations weak spot a big supermarket is not going to want a reputation for tribunals its about spotting that and thinking about how you can influence it thats the dream clara summers not her real name clings to as she contemplates quitting her job in events at a copenhagen bar where a brocentric atmosphere means that as the only woman in the management team she is handed all the menial tasks a superior said she was too sensitive when she raised the matter when she recently refused to add more jobs to her workload her boss told her to do them anyway to keep the boys happy summerss union advised her to walk away do i feel like a quitter for wanting to leave very much so she says i wish i could revolutionise my workplace and i hope that i have in some way through the person i am i fantasise that one day i will be able to see the positive

the terrible oneyear anniversary of gamergate is nearly here and the women that make your games are warweary exhausted by a cultural battle that we never asked for we are professionals trying to do our job screamed at by children who dont want girls in their clubhouse elizabeth sampat is one of these professionals shes a game designer at popcap one of the most successful studios in the world in the aftermath of gamergate shes struggling with an ethical dilemma shes uncomfortable asking girls to enter the game industry knowing the abuse they will inevitably face i will no longer participate in encouraging young women and girls to become game industry professionals wrote sampat in a popular facebook post i will continue to fight tooth and nail for every woman who is currently here but until the industry and gaming culture improves its unethical i understand where sampat is coming from someone just emailed me their fantasy about mutilating my genitals and murdering me by slicing my body in half its something they clearly spent a lot of time writing reading it i should probably feel something fear anger or even exhaustion but these threats have happened so often i just feel nothing how could you support anyones daughter entering this environment what does this kind of abuse mean for women like myself that work in the industry well its like the zombie apocalypse all day every day but one hosted on social media and comment platforms imagining themselves as noble warriors and not angry misogynists they bang on the doors and windows moaning about the social justice warriors sjws that have taken over their video games inevitably when this is published the comments below this article will follow the same pattern this online warfare is the only weapon those involved in gamergate have because they cant compete with their sexist ideas and incoherent philosophy their battle to scrub their wikipedia entry exemplifies this as they seek to whitewash the gamergate page of its sexist roots while attempting to delete edit and vandalise my page and those of other highprofile women you know youve lost when your only resort is a comment section and yet gamergate isnt the real problem facing women in games in software engineering we have the term technical debt when you dont do a job correctly unaddressed problems become harder and harder to solve the videogame industry has massive sexism debt interest accrued for problems unaddressed for the last years gamergate isnt the problem its a symptom of an industry that is deeply sexist and unable to understand it one of the strangest events of the last year was having a law and order episode made about gamergate the main character is a fictional composite of anita sarkeesian zoe quinn and me women in gaming what did i expect she says darkly just before she quits the industry i think of that scene every day just what did i expect standing up to gamergate and trying to raise awareness of gamedevs inclusivity problem a warm welcome i got into the game industry to make games not to be a feminist critic my biggest fear is that in five years i might still be talking about my gender and not the games i make recently i spent an entire day reporting separate death threats the week before my private number was shared online a form of internet abuse known as doxing and someone called my phone while masturbating i just hung up and went back to work i try to find the dark humour where i can the women of the industry are surviving this cultural war in different ways a common tactic i see is staying out of the media hoping to not get noticed by the gamergate mob i have a friend who used to have one of the most highprofile shows for women gamers she told me the other day that she was scared to reboot it because gamergate has a reputation for going after peoples children another friend says she effects her company like a magnet gently pulling them toward greater inclusivity another has a corporate edict to not discuss womens equality in her public role another was warned by her colleagues that discussing women in games was like discussing religion in the workplace and she decided to push back by standing up and speaking her truth for me the battle is shifting from gamergate to the wider issues facing women in tech the sexism debt that must be addressed sampat is completely correct that the culture of the game industry must change and its time to talk less about death threats and more about changes in the professional sphere i want to make it better for young women by making it better for us now in some ways the real damage of gamergate is pushing the publics idea of sexism so far to the extreme that changes in the professional sphere seem unimportant in the s genderbased harassment was getting hit on at work the version having armed swat teams sent to your house in a false hostage threat make that seem almost quaint the truth is the sexist behaviour that really holds women in games back doesnt come from the moustachetwirling cartoon villains of gamergate its the sexist hiring practices of our journalistic institutions its the consistently oversexualised designs we see its the entitled maleplayer base that screams from the hills at the smallest inclusions of women we need the male professionals in our field to understand the unconscious bias that they consistently show against women yet they sleep peacefully at night assured that the real troublemakers are the ones sending us death threats i was at a bar a few weeks ago having drinks with a wellknown journalist in our field do you think my career is going to be defined by gamergate i asked him worriedly he looked me dead in the eye and said i think it depends on if you can pivot at some point you need to use your raised profile to move on to do new things im taking that advice and pivoting im sure the misogynist fringe of gamergate will continue to make our lives hell in any way they can theyll continue to threaten me and other women intimidate and bully us but at a certain point you just have to get back to work besides we make games they make internet comments who really has the power,2015-08,terrible oneyear anniversary gamergate nearly woman make game warweary exhausted cultural battle never asked professional trying job screamed child dont want girl

employers should provide domestic violence leave so survivors can have financial security and support a report backed by all major parties has urged the domestic violence report was tabled in the senate on thursday and makes recommendations after months of public hearings the report recommends that the commonwealth look at ways of facilitating domestic violence leave for the public and private sectors but government senators on the inquiry committee while not dissenting from the reports broad conclusions said flexible leave conditions already existed comments added to the report by the liberal backbencher cory bernardi stated if an employer wishes to provide additional entitlements they can do so through enterprise bargaining the greens backed the australian council of trade unions calls for a mandatory days of domestic violence leave the australian greens recommend that the federal government legislate to give every employee days of nonaccumulating paid domestic violence leave to be taken for reasons related to domestic violence or for attending court appearances attending appointments and finding accommodation the deputy greens leader larissa waters said in comments added to the report the report also calls on the federal government to do more to find affordable housing to support survivors of domestic violence who have been forced to leave their home the committee heard that the lack of affordable longerterm housing options for victims of domestic and family violence means women and their children need to remain in crisis accommodation for a much longer period which in turn results in the lack of availability of crisis accommodation the report said the government has made homelessness services for victims of domestic violence a priority in the m joint commonwealth and staterun national partnership agreement on homelessness a snapshot of demographic trends released by the australian institute of health and welfare found that a third of people seeking emergency housing support were fleeing domestic violence it recommended that special focus be placed on how to support male victims of domestic violence who cannot access womens shelters and genderspecific services understanding perpetrators from indigenous rural and nonenglish speaking communities as well as those in samesex relationships and setting out specific intervention tactics for these groups should also be a priority the report said the institutes report found that women accounted for of the victims of domestic violence two million australians have suffered intimate partner violence and a further million have suffered violence perpetrated by other family members indigenous women are times more likely to be admitted to hospital owing to domestic violence than the general population anyone affected by sexual assault or domestic violence can call respect or or visit respectorgau,2015-08,employer provide domestic violence leave survivor financial security support report

social workers do their jobs on the front lines and too often they find themselves in harms way as a result those of us in the profession were painfully reminded of this on august when child protection social worker lara sobel was allegedly shot twice by a client jody herring who had lost custody of her yearold daughter many of us who look after the countrys most vulnerable are threatened with physical violence on a daily basis whether from domestic abusers or drugaddicted parents teri zenner was killed with a chainsaw during a home visit to a schizophrenic man in kansas tanja brownoneal was stabbed while helping a man apply for food stamps in baltimore ladonna wolford was beaten to death with a baseball bat by two teenagers at a shelter for runaways in west virginia those are just a few names of social workers slain in the line of duty social service workers are some of the main victims of workplace violence according to the american federation of state county and municipal employees but the risks of our profession arent just physical sometimes we are haunted by what we see for years i am by a girl i once met on the job lets call her emma i was in my mid s and making just a little over an hour as a childrens mental health case manager when i met her emma was diagnosed with ptsd after a family friend sexually molested her at the public pool she still lived with flashbacks and engaged in sexually aggressive behavior i went for a home visit though you could hardly call it a home there were twelve people crammed into less than square feet emmas mother told me that she had too many mouths to feed and emma had gone to live with her boyfriend emma was yearsold emmas boyfriend was as a mandated reporter i had to report this to child protection services and to the police hours later i stood in the hallway of a third floor apartment in the inner city just a block away from the freeway i could hear cars whizzing by the flashing lights of the squad car in the alley reflected off of the dingy beige walls next to me a police officer beat on the door of the apartment emma had told me that this is where her boyfriend lived she has also told me that her boyfriend was involved in sur a notorious gang i didnt know if that was true i only knew that she deserved a better life no one answered the door emmas mother refused to file a missing person report she was rid of her as her social worker i could have filed one myself but my supervisor advised me to find a family member instead so that when emma was found she would have someone to go home to i tracked down emmas grandmother and walked her through the paperwork i called the police weekly to see if they had any leads on emma i talked to emmas friends at school and passed on any information they gave me to the police i used all the weapons in my arsenal several weeks later i received a threatening voice mail on my work phone a deep mans voice said leave emma the fuck alone if you come looking for her any more ill fucking kill you shes mine now bitch my supervisor told me to drop the case i never saw emma again when we lost lara sobel i couldnt help but remember emma while sobel likely had countless successful cases families where she intervened and both the family and the communityatlarge were better for it i imagine she also had her own emmas cases so intense that they both thrilled and scared her but she still returned to work every day for years believing that she could make a difference in the lives of children we owe it to her to make sure that social workers who dedicate themselves to improving the lives of others do not end up losing their own a result,2015-08,social worker job front line often find harm way result u profession painfully reminded august

another week another misogynistic comment by a highprofile man during an interview with a national newspaper lord john prescott raised a decadeold accusation that he had assaulted linda mcdougall by pushing her against a wall saying that she was built like a bloody barn door and that the fucking house would have fallen down if he had done so there you have it had mcdougall been considered attractive by prescott perhaps he might have proudly owned up to such atrocious behaviour not on your life men use all kinds of justifications for sexual assault on women ranging from she asked for it to i was doing her a favour the implication being that no other man would want her prescott who vehemently denies the allegation is far from the only public figure who has dared to make such remarks earlier this year a senior liberal democrat council member philip drury resigned after posting on facebook remarks insinuating that a yearold female student was too ugly to be raped drurys outburst followed the womans claims that she had been sexually assaulted in italy but police there believe she made the attack up drury wrote not sure anyone would even want to think about it looking at her lol last december according to a report of an interview with a newspaper called zero hora a brazilian congressman jair bolsonaro said of a political opponent maria do rosrio nunes that he would not rape her because she is not worth it because shes ugly shes not my type i would never rape her the remarks followed an accusation by bolsonaro that do rosrio had previously called him a rapist which she denies and after her speech in which she condemned human rights violations committed during the usbacked military dictatorship reacting to the dominique strausskahn case internet users questioned whether he would have raped his accuser because of how ugly she is and the french media rated her attractiveness of all the myths about rape one of the most damaging is that men do it because they are overcome with lust for a supermodel type of woman whom they cannot resist but rape happens to babies elderly women and everyone in between and yet we routinely conflate rape and sexual assault with conventional attractiveness and perpetuate the notion that ugly women dont get raped and that attractive men dont need to commit rape i recall an incident a few years ago i had just been on tv talking about the disgraceful number of convictions for rape in britain on my way home i stopped off at the bank and was immediately asked quite confrontationally if i was that women just on the telly about rape i confirmed i was while handing my cheque to the cashier you should shut your mouth the man continued whats it got to do with you youre too ugly to rape the cashier looked shocked saw how upset i was and reassured me by saying dont listen to him of course you are not more recently i was in a pub with a female friend one evening engaged in conversation when we noticed a man hovering next to us what are two beautiful ladies doing on your own he leered preparing to pull up a chair when we helpfully pointed out we were actually together ergo not alone we quickly became slags followed by lesbians as we left the pub we heard the charmer shout fucking ugly dykes they wouldnt even get raped it is not only vile sexists who hold such views some women buy into this too which is unsurprising bearing in mind the amount of rapedenial propaganda with which we are inundated when andrea dworkin wrote movingly about being raped in paris a number of prominent feminists who certainly should have known better said in private to me that it probably had not happened because andrea was not the type of women men would find attractive this is nothing short of internalised womanhating when i along with many other secondwave feminists proudly rejected beauty products and other feminine frippery such as high heels we were judged and vilified by men who took great offence at us not dressing to their requirements over the years i have become used to being told by a certain type of man on a regular basis that i am unfuckable and therefore unrapeable i have however been raped and sexually assaulted presumably by men with their eyes closed being told we are too ugly to rape is such a common experience amongst my feminist peers that the crime writer val mcdermid and i once spent a hilarious evening mocking up a feminist rock band named ugly rape and it is not only feminists who come in for such bile disabled women and girls are incredibly vulnerable to rape and sexual assault and yet are told they are undesirable and asexual rape is a sadistic act of punishment we are raped by men who hate us not by those who desire us so much they have no self control they do it to control us and then they tell us we are mad for imagining it happened because we are not good enough for them to violate abuse and colonise the truth about rape and sexual assault is ugly,2015-08,another week another misogynistic comment highprofile man interview national newspaper lord john prescott raised decadeold accusation assaulted linda mcdougall pushing wall saying wa

unfair dismissal the queensland government also plans to lobby the federal government and private sector to take on similar policies the minister for women shannon fentiman said the government would spend m over four years on its response to the high priority recommendations of bryces report this financial year it would spend more than m on existing programs and new steps to deal with family

whats it going to take the death of a child members of parliament hear this question more than you might think often from residents protesting against roadworks or trafficgenerating development in fact the threat that a child will die unless the government takes action urgently is heard so frequently by mps that it can lose its potency but there are times when mps and communities have to act and act swiftly with sufficient resources to improve childrens safety and keep them alive seat belt laws and car seats sunsmart practices mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse and worldleading research that dramatically reduced the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome these are all initiatives australia took on with vigour and commitment in an effort to save childrens lives tragically it took the death of a child luke batty to wake australia up to the slaughter of innocents mainly women and children taking place inside our family homes victorias royal commission into family violence is putting forward a compelling case for urgent wellresourced action on the opening day of the commission counsel assisting mark moshinsky qc said tens of thousands of people live with family violence every day with little or no change in the prevalence of family violence in recent years family violence remains at shockingly high levels families are torn apart lives ruined children damaged the commission has heard that one in six australian women has been subjected to partner violence since the age of and that each year there are on average family violencerelated deaths nationwide coag reported last month so far in up to two women a week have been killed indigenous women and women with a disability or from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds can be at much greater risk i applaud the prime minister and our state and territory leaders when they condemn domestic and family violence i am pleased that the subject is on the coag agenda im encouraged that australian of the year rosie batty is a member of the coag advisory panel on reducing violence against women and their children but i am dismayed by the lack of urgency attending the issue consider that within a few months of the martin place siege where two citizens tragically died australia has a new commonwealth counterterrorism coordinator coag has agreed to a new counterterrorism strategy and there are new laws before the parliament to strip citizenship from australians involved in terrorism tony abbott says this legislation will stop terrorists from being loose on our streets and what are our nations leaders doing to stop those inflicting terror in our homes coag has agreed to hear expert advice at its next meeting on a national advertising campaign messaging and how to target it where is the urgency coag does anyone think that if two women a week were being taken by their partners to martin place and being shot dead in public that we would need several coag meetings to design a national advertising campaign of course not the victorian royal commission is making clear that our efforts and services to keep women and children safe in their own homes are poorly funded badly fragmented and difficult to navigate the reality is that had it not been for the death of a child in a public park our nation would likely not be having highlevel conversations about family violence if it were not for the brave voice of his mother the conversations might have already stopped ive been to a few coag meetings in my day they can be stultifying affairs with little scope for the impact of human emotion and trauma they are the kind of meeting that can take a statistic such as two women killed each week and come up with a bureaucratic response like at its next meeting coag will consider the model law framework for domestic violence orders and national perpetrator standards which are important next steps in addressing violence against women and their children i urge coag to begin its next meeting considering the words of rosie batty were spending hundreds of millions extra on the war on terrorism but women who fear for their safety are still being turned away from services because of a lack of funds women and children are dying because of family violence and we need to see a commensurate response there is no shortage of goodwill from our leaders but we need words put into action including increased funding of family violence services every day they wait more lives are put at significant risk this is no idle threat women and children are dying there are few issues requiring more urgent attention,2015-08,whats going take death child member parliament hear question might think often resident protesting roadworks trafficgenerating development fact threat child die unless

its starting to get embarrassing that our politicians are ok with the idea that the united states and papua new guinea are the only two countries in the world with absolutely no provision for some kind of paid time off for working women who are new mothers according to the united nations thankfully some american corporations may finally be acknowledging that their employees are entitled to some kind of paid leave when they have children netflix started the ball rolling at the beginning of last week announcing it would offer new parents both mothers and fathers unlimited paid parental leave during the first year following the birth or adoption of a child during that yearlong period the parent will receive their full salary and can stay at home full time come into work full time or go back and forth between those two as needs dictate an impressively flexible policy designed to cater to the vagaries of parenting a newborn within hours microsoft had sweetened its own parental leave policy in what observers quickly interpreted as a response to netflixs opening salvo in the silicon valley talent wars microsoft now will give new mothers a total of weeks of paid leave after the birth of a child up from a total of paid weeks previously and toss in some prematernity leave as well making the whole package more flexible last month ibm initiated a plan to help breastfeeding mothers who are traveling on business ship their breast milk home to their babies free of charge it already offers weeks of paid leave to new mothers and of course if you wouldnt mind focusing on your career for a few years and deferring motherhood silicon valley is taking the lead in offering women benefits in that respect too companies like facebook and apple are offering women a shiny new benefit in the form of the ability to freeze their eggs and postpone the need to worry about the pesky question of parental leave altogether for now the or so netflix employees who will benefit from the companys move are extremely fortunate and the companys management is to be applauded although id applaud even more enthusiastically if the policy also applied to all its workers and didnt exclude the parttime staffers working in dvd distribution centers but before we all get carried away with the excitement lets stop to recall several important factors firstly tech companies are hardly representative of corporate america if you read the stories about netflixs initiative and choked on your morning coffee when you read that the company already offers its employees unlimited vacation well welcome to silicon valley thats not all that uncommon and other workplace perks can include such cool stuff that ordinary folks can scarcely dream of including more mundane things like the use of nap pods and free massages the reason for all this of course is that the unemployment rate in the software industry is about half the nationwide average and it has been incredibly hard for fastgrowing technology companies worldwide to find the staff they need elsewhere in corporate america no such pressure exists for ceos to lavish big perks including big parental leave benefits on grateful employees and even in silicon valley the number of employees who will take advantage of those perks may turn out to be tiny in practice thats because even when companies offer perks the culture is one that rewards those employees who dont take advantage of those that take them away from the workplace or distract them from the job and sometimes even silicon valley companies have sent decidedly familyunfriendly signals as when marissa mayer canceled yahoos flexible workfromhome policies in early shortly after becoming ceo requiring everyone to work in the office mayer famously took only two weeks of maternity leave herself so netflix and others may offer these benefits safe in the knowledge that only a fraction of their employees will take advantage of them for fear of looking like slackers the biggest issue of all may be that silicon valley simply doesnt have that many women around compared to other workplaces the gap is widening according to a recent study by the american association of university women that found that just of those working in computing today are women down from in only about of startup technology companies that get backed by venture capital funds are led by woman women are underrepresented in the ranks of senior management and on boards of directors in silicon valley the brogrammer culture just exacerbates the problem finally theres the potential for backlash remember when dan price ceo of gravity payments made just as big a splash as netflix has just done by announcing his intention of raising the salaries of every single employee on his staff to at least over the next three years that happened in april right in the middle of yet another fierce debate over the question of what represented a living wage and it was hailed by many as a visionary act of altruism especially since price cut his own million salary to to finance the move now price appears to be dealing with a backlash from parts of the public and even from some of his own employees who didnt like the fact that newer recruits with fewer skills were being paid the same that they earned netflixs innovation at the moment is being seen as fascinating intriguing and even exotic and somewhat outlandish during one national public radio show discussion devoted to the new policy the host even marveled that other countries routinely allowed all new mothers paid maternity leave as if the us was the rule rather than the exception the reality were still playing catchup with the rest of the world forget about paid leave government rules about unpaid leave dont even cover about of working women so the netflix initiative is a very very tiny first step rather than a giant leap forward unless and until generous family leave policies become the rule rather than the exception and parents feel free to take advantage of them rather than fearing that doing so will jeopardize their jobs lets not break out the champagne,2015-08,starting get embarrassing politician ok

im a single mother and i struggle to support my son on the an hour i make at one of the most exclusive clubs in america the us senate im a cashier employed by the britishowned contractor that runs the cafeterias in the senate office buildings but even though i serve some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world i cant afford to buy my son school supplies or clothes after paying all my bills and providing for the needs of my son im in the hole every month on top of the low wages i get a layoff notice every time the us senate goes on recess which means that i dont get a paycheck for weeks a year when i realized that i couldnt survive on what i was making at the senate i made a difficult decision faced with eviction notices and unpaid bills i decided to dance at a strip club a few nights a week to earn extra money it was the only job i could find that let me work a flexible schedule and earn a living wage i dont want to be a stripper it can be demeaning to dance for men who show no respect for women i only do it out of necessity because i have to support my son he gets as and bs on his report card and my shelves are full of his football trophies my son makes me proud and i want to give him everything that my mother couldnt give me the wages i make at my day job just dont leave me much choice during the day i make sure that senators and their staffs get their coffee quickly and efficiently as they run from meeting to meeting or to the senate floor to cast votes and ive served the nine current and former us senators who are running to become the next president of the united states but while my customers give speeches in iowa and new hampshire promising to deliver the american dream to hardworking people they arent lifting a finger to help the workers like me who serve them every day not everyone has another job but its almost impossible to support even a small family without one i only want what every mother wants to provide my child with a life thats better than my own my childhood was emotionally physically and sexually abusive my mother was addicted to crack cocaine and not only did she do drugs in front of me she neglected to feed or bathe me for days i soon realized she loved drugs and the fast life more than me when i turned the authorities intervened and almost sent me into the fostercare system luckily my grandparents stepped in and allowed me to live with them but a couple of years later they moved away and left me with my aunt she didnt have patience for another child under her roof so she kicked me out i was years old and forced to survive on the streets of washington dc i eventually met a man who said he loved me and would help me out he was a pimp he was physically and sexually abusive and forced me into prostitution i only managed to escape from his control when i was i told myself that if i ever became a mother i would do everything in my power to make sure my child would not have to suffer like i did the birth of my son was a turning point in my life i found a fulltime job at the us senate and i was so proud to be able to work in such an important place during that time i went back to school and i got my ged i thought that i was doing great but it didnt take long for me to learn that even a job in the senate wasnt enough to give me and my son a shot at a better life as all the current and former senators running for the white house prepare to hit the campaign trail during the august recess i hope they remember the people they are leaving behind without a paycheck and when they sit down with the primary voters and listen to their problems i hope theyll be thinking about my story too and the tough decisions the workers who serve them every day have to make for the people they

the term manchild conjures up a vivid image a lazy selfcentred bloke who relies on women to wash his socks listen to his problems remind him to go to the doctor and make sure he maintains his relationships its a generalisation to be sure but one that resonates with many women for important reasons the manchild was front and centre in my mind while reading jess zimmermans wheres my cut a brilliant and accessible exploration of womens emotional labour in interpersonal relationships women should get paid for all the work they typically do for free all the affirmation forbearance consultation pacifying guidance tutorial and weathering abuse that we spend energy on every single day zimmermans conception of emotional labour is a subset of what feminists call womens work which also includes things like housework reproductive and caring labour these are services that have historically been rendered by women on an unpaid basis now theyre being recognised albeit using different terminology by decidedly nonradical institutions like australian bank anz which recently released a discussion paper on the gender pay gap stating unfortunately australian women are more likely to retire in poverty than men this is largely because they are paid less for the same work and they often revert to parttime jobs to assume child rearing or family responsibilities at some point in their lives the manchild is the imagined beneficiary of all this socalled womens work freed from the burdens of looking after himself and his children and able to go out and earn a higher income he also wins the luxury of acting like a child the extent to which this is reflected in individual lives varies enormously but the outcomes dont lie women earn less because we spend a lot of time taking care of people especially men and men make more because they dont this arrangement has historically been beneficial to men and a range of beliefs about womens innate caring capacities have emerged to prove its natural women are said to be better listeners nurturers femininity itself is supplied as a justification for why women enjoy emotional labour and that supposed enjoyment that affective satisfaction is why the work is unpaid after all if we like looking after the manchild so much why do we need to be paid both zimmerman and the anz bank are here expressing an interest in doing away with the manchild zimmermans wry suggestion is that women should charge men directly for unequal interactions transforming the manchild into a consumer and emotional labour into a product for purchase imagine a menu of emotional labor acknowledge your thirsty posturing pretend to find you fascinating soothe your ego so you dont get angry what women would do with this increase in money and free time is left unanswered and zimmerman says this suggestion is at least partially tongue in cheek its useful to contrast this with anzs approach to the issue their premise here involves an acknowledgement in economic terms of the material disadvantages that accrue to women from performing forms of labour that have never before been considered valuable this is as close as banks will ever get to saying yes the manchild is real but the difference is stark where zimmerman desires freedom from the manchild as an end in itself what anz clearly wants is for women to be relieved of unpaid emotional reproductive and caring duties specifically so they can commit themselves to the paid workforce rather than equalising the emotional load the bank seeks to ensure women spend more time taking care of business and less time taking care of men family and community this represents a sneaky move to hijack feminist arguments in service of the aims of capital which does not inherently care about women men or anyone else zimmermans droll suggestion that men should pay for emotional labour sparked fury among many men and some women despite the unlikelihood of it ever happening but corporate efforts to wring as much work out of everyone as possible using the language of feminism are an unwelcome extension of the demands that have been placed on men for centuries looking at it this way we can see how gender justice and economic justice are inextricably linked taking all forms of labour seriously whether theyre currently paid or unpaid and compensating them adequately will benefit everybody even the manchildren,2015-08,term manchild conjures vivid image lazy selfcentred bloke relies woman wash sock listen problem remind go doctor make sure maintains relationship

when i talk to boys and young men at school and university about why they dont call themselves feminists the answer is never because i hate women instead they tend to express reservations about female supremacy or manhating theres still a lot of confusion about the word this week heforshe the united nations campaign aimed at engaging men in the battle for gender equality kicks off its getfree tour visiting universities and talking to students about the issue so i spoke to a group of young male feminists to ask them how big a battle it will be to bring their peers into the feminist fold and how difficult it is for young men to speak out about sexism in a yearold research student who wanted to remain anonymous told me i think most young men would not identify as feminists either because they dont like the word or just because of a more general lack of knowledge of feminism or fear that it amounts to a chip off their masculinity luke bonnett a yearold engineering consultant says its not something that young men talk about at least not among my circle of friends often when someone knows better but is still sexist its difficult to convince them why what theyre doing isnt acceptable and its not just political correctness gone mad sam harman a secondyear student at oxford university adds i think perhaps the crucial factor for young men in these kinds of situations is how they think the room will react if theyre likely to get a good reaction theyll tend to speak out if they think they will come across as a nitpicker or a sissy its far rarer stephen burrell is a phd student at durham university researching domestic violence prevention work with young men he agrees that anxiety about masculinity is a key issue theres a huge amount of pressure among your peers especially in environments such as school or university to behave in certain masculine ways which frequently involve highly sexist and misogynistic behaviour but ethan vinceurwin a student at the university of york says i think an increasing number of young men are beginning to feel very strongly about the issue and are standing up and being counted i used to feel like feminism was something that only women could be part of but it now portrays itself as a much more inclusive movement on my visits to schools and universities it has been clear that behaviours such as sexual harassment rape jokes and sexist abuse are the preserve of a very small but vocal minority of young men most of my interviewees agree that those identifying as feminists outwardly at least are also probably in the minority so what about the critical mass of guys in between could engaging them be the key to swaying the balance burrell says to refuse to go along with sexism and to speak out against it amidst such pressure can be really difficult i know because i have often failed to do it myself but as soon as one guy does it they might be surprised about just how many of their peers agree with them and how many were also too scared to say something they say it also helps if discussions include the aspects of gender inequality and stereotypes that most directly affect boys hugh taylor is a volunteer with great men a project from the gender equality charity the great initiative which runs workshops in schools with boys and young men aged he says its important to note that things we might traditionally view as feminism or sexism make up only a small part of what we talk about the main objective is to give them a platform to discuss issues that can arise from gender in general and to try instil a sense of healthy masculinity from this the discussion often leans towards issues such as homophobia or depression in young men and male suicide rates from the boys in the workshops misunderstanding is pretty common but open hostility less so he says ive always been pleasantly surprised just how many young people actually seem to have a good grip on these issues all thats been missing is the chance to vocalise their opinions the young men i interview all feel that the problem is a lack of understanding about feminism rather than widespread antipathy towards it refreshingly instead of calling for feminism to be rebranded most of them point to education and male role models as the key to changing attitudes callum lynch a yearold student says i think men should be unashamedly open about identifying as a feminist to help to remove the unwarranted stigma surrounding the term mark woodward head of careers at bablake school in coventry has supported the creation of a school feminist society but says he and one boy are currently the only male attendees he told me i suspect the majority who stay silent in a group are afraid of standing out and being ridiculed teachers instigating discussion and making it ok to stand up have to be there as role models thats key jack fletcher is the national coordinator for sexpressionuk a student organisation that runs sex and relationship sessions within the community he notes that primary school children seem much more willing to discuss the problem of sexist behaviour than those in older age groups where other influences such as

i first learned about the suffragettes in a history lesson aged and initially i couldnt really grasp their significance a few years later i was completely in awe of them these campaigners were by no means perfect there were clashes contradictions and schisms within the movement but the first wave of feminism did something great for women both in their fight for our right to the vote and in the broader implications of that struggle for womens autonomy and respect it was caitlin moran who said that feminism should be a massive patchwork quilt we should all fight the battles that are important to us and bring our individual ideas and strengths to the movement with the film suffragette set to be released next month here are seven things i think young feminists should prioritise today help girls learn about consent and healthy sexual relationships ill never forget the moment a friend told me referring to the confusion that remains around the idea of consent that girls are being raped and they dont even know even though i have been lucky enough to attend a school where we have comprehensive pshe lessons not once has the issue of consent been raised in class for millions of teenagers growing up in a culture where pornography is now ubiquitous and where it influences male and female sexuality in incredibly damaging ways it is more important than ever to counter the narrative that there are blurred lines around consent its important that we teach girls that sex isnt something they should be afraid of they are allowed to be sexual beings we need to talk about female boundaries to ensure that girls and boys can have healthy sexual relationships and can learn how to say no listen to all the women in the movement old and young nothing annoys me more than the idea that feminism has to come in waves right now were supposedly on the fourth wave of feminism or is it the fifth feminism is meant to be a movement to liberate women from every background and of every age but time and again when i engage in feminist debates it worries me that the voices of older women are not being heard by younger women in the movement the feminist academic lori marso has argued that feminists rarely seek to identify with the lives of their mothers and its hard not to see some truth in this we roll our eyes and block our ears to our mothers generation because ultimately we believe we are better we tear down the work of second wavers those women who campaigned so fiercely for womens rights in the s they are now often written off as transexclusionary radical feminists terfs sex worker exclusionary radical feminists swerfs or simply as bigots we ignore and conveniently forget the many victories they won on our behalf as the writer glosswitch has argued the problem with the idea that feminism comes in waves is that men get to leave something permanent we seek to wash away the traces our foremothers left some of the best women in my life are or more years older than me through these friendships ive found that we have a lot more in common than i could ever have imagined we need to stop erasing the work of our foremothers embrace intersectionality the theory of intersectionality a term coined in the late s by us academic kimberl crenshaw has become central to many recent feminist debates it reflects the fact that we do not all navigate the world in the same way and asks us to recognise that people can experience multiple oppressions which intersect in powerful ways i am a woman for example but i am also black and i have a visual disability for feminism to really work we must acknowledge the fact that as well as being women we have multiple other identities that affect our lives or as rowan blanchard a yearold actress neatly put it the way a black woman experiences sexism and inequality is different from the way a white woman experiences sexism and inequality feminism shouldnt just be about liberating white women or straight women or rich women feminism should have at its centre the voices of all women fight for reproductive rights last week the hashtag shoutyourabortion trended on twitter with women speaking out against a culture that expects them to feel ashamed about having had an abortion this reflected the fact that the reproductive rights of women in the uk and worldwide still face potential threats and they shouldnt over generations the misogyny that women face often shifts and changes shape but one thing persists women still dont have control over their own bodies women need access to contraception the right to abortion and the right to choose not to have children we must never feel ashamed about our bodies and we must never stop shouting until those rights are secured for women everywhere reject choice feminism in recent times the idea of choice feminism has become really popular i obviously support womens rights to make their own choices but the idea that i have to support every specific choice just because a woman made it is something i think we need to do away with by all means get a boob job but dont try and justify it with feminism nobody will ever be the perfect feminist so its all right to make choices that arent feminist but not to label them as feminist after the fact simply because you made a choice and youre a woman we need to stop naming everything as empowering labiaplasty for instance is not empowering or feminist structural sexism exists and because it exists it will play a part no matter what we think in our decisions recognise and address mens fatal violence against women i agree that its not really enjoyable to talk about male violence against women or to name it as male violence but when i read the stories of the counting dead women campaign the importance of talking about this becomes obvious in the uk thousands of women every year suffer or die at the hands of men women like amina abdi who was four months pregnant and stabbed to death and carla whitlock who had acid thrown in her face in a country where at least two women are killed each week at the hands of men where women are raped and are sexually assaulted each year where theres a call to the police every minute about domestic violence it is clear that male violence exists naming the problem and recognising how this affects women needs to be a priority for young feminists and no it doesnt mean you hate men with refuges closing down and rape crisis centres struggling for funding there are a lot of campaigns still to organise say no to media sexism the no more page campaign put this issue on the map and in the years since they started campaigning the sun has stopped dedicating a page each day to a large picture of a topless woman but the media is still hypersexualised and saturated with images of the perfect woman who is apparently sexy submissive white largebreasted tall and skinny we need to challenge these images diverse female representation matters because if women continue to be depicted as secondclass citizens only there to titillate men our worth determined by how sexually attractive we are a generation of young women will grow up with a muchreduced sense of their ability to follow in the bold brilliant footsteps of the suffragettes,2015-09,first learned suffragette history lesson aged initially couldnt really grasp

in the ongoing national conversation about work life balance and domestic parity between men and women theres a phrase thats not quite as popular as having it all or leaning in but is important just the same this is not just a womens issue sheryl sandberg has encouraged men to get involved in advocating for womens equality at work and at home academics have pointed out that mens participation is necessary for real change and earlier this year in his state of the union address president obama said its time we stop treating child care as a side issue or a womens issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us its true child care housework balancing work and home life these are issues that men absolutely need to care about and take action on but not just because it benefits them to or to do so as a favor to help women out men need to get off the bench and do something because gendered domestic disparity is a problem that they created its only fair that men fix it this is one of those truths thats tricky to say because feminists are so often working hard to make the movements messages palatable we dont want men to feel alienated and pointing a finger can feel counterproductive but repeating this is not just a womens issue over and over simply has not worked for years feminists have argued that work life balance and the unequal division of labor in the home and with children is a family issue nothing has changed this isnt to say that men havent gotten involved many have but we need more than mens grudging participation we need them to take active responsibility in the workplace where they can do more to fight for equal pay and against discrimination but also in the home years ago before we were married my husband andrew ran a reading group it was comprised mostly of young progressiveminded men in their s one day they were discussing an article about the disproportionate care labor women do for kids and elders and the group was all in agreement this was unfair they talked about legislation and policy changes that could help but when andrew asked how many of them expected their future partners to do the majority of child care the room got silent and then defensive all of these young men who considered themselves progressive and were willing to talk about political change were completely unwilling to let go of the idea that their personal lives might be impacted in any way for the cause i dont think this is an unusual attitude on either side of the aisle so yeah maybe its time we werent so polite about this particular battle the kind of change that these problems require lasting change change thats both systemic and personal requires more than mens support women didnt choose to make less money bias does that women didnt choose to be the default care giver socialization does that women didnt create this problem men did that,2015-09,ongoing national conversation work life balance domestic parity men

for years i have asked smug questions about womens rights which are repeated by many men and more privileged women than feminists like to admit whats the problem and why the fuss the battles for the vote the right to work and to control fertility have been won in the rich world at least individuals suffer sexual violence and discrimination but deplorable though their suffering is it cannot detract from the extraordinary advances women have made in the past years todays blazing rows about young lawyers calling out old lawyers who make passes at them are mere moppingup operations in comparison to the struggles of the past whats the problem we ask when women graduates earn three times as much as nongraduates within a decade of leaving university why the fuss we say when schoolgirls are outperforming schoolboys across the developed world many still want to fuss crowds have filled halls to support the new womens equality party since march it has recruited more than supporters it will be running for office across the country next year sandy toksvig will probably stand for london mayor and a surprisingly large number of candidates may turn up at the welsh assembly elections but beyond giving journalists the chance to write about the implied awfulness of welsh men womens equality can appear to be a party without a serious point it has no economic or foreign policy its members can be for or against scottish independence a war against islamic state or the renewal of trident all they must believe is that there should be an end to violence against women and that women should have equal representation in politics and business equal pay and equal opportunities and equal childcare responsibilities when no mainstream politician says hes against equal pay for equal work and not even the most extreme politicians say they are in favour of violence against women it sounds a tad trite trite that is until you look at the detail the womens equality party was formed in a moment of spontaneous anger at londons south bank centre on march on stage were three mps margot james the first openly lesbian tory mp womens minister jo swinson and stella creasy one of labours few dynamic mps whose battle honours included forcing the government to regulate the payday loan racket their feminism was impeccable but the audience was restless it wasnt that they doubted the speakers commitment they just did not believe that their parties would allow them to express it the same spirit which created ukip the nationalist surge in scotland and the corbyn craze on the left moved the hall catherine mayer then a journalist on time magazine stood up to speak mayer is one of the best reporters i have seen but she doesnt just record the words of others she has a few of her own british women needed their own party she said only by threatening to take their votes would they force traditional politicians to act if ukip could make the major parties change their policies on immigration an equality party could make them take womens rights seriously anyone who wants to help me set one up can see me in the bar mayer went to the bar where she was promptly mobbed the fate of the women left stranded on the platform made mayers point for her jo swinson lost her seat after serving a coalition government that had done little to advance womens rights and wellbeing david cameron won a majority but left margot james stranded and powerless on the backbenches her isolation was as nothing however compared to the humiliations the labour leadership visited on creasy she came second in the labour deputy leadership election with a more than creditable performance since the winner tom watson had the trade union machine behind him but the farleft has never been a feminist movement as corbyns appearances on iranian state tv where he never protested against the ayatollahs suppression of womens rights show watsons trade union movement is hardly feminised either its failure to attract women members is pushing it into irrelevance the new leaders panicked when they realised they had appointed men to all the top jobs and not on merit either so they might look better they dragged in creasy at the last minute and gave her a junior position she can now attend shadow cabinet meetings but not do anything so manly as vote she is to be corbyns window dressing and wallflower at the same time i have signed up to give a month to the womens equality i know i know women will be the ruin of me in part i am paying my pittance because i know and like its leaders and want to help them meet the enormous costs of fighting elections in britain but my main reason was that i have learned rather late in life that the comforting story of the ascent of women is complacent to the point of somnolence two women are murdered by their partners every week if they were murdered by terrorists wed have martial law as it is we have an indifferent silence women make up only of mps of judges and of ftse company directors when they complain supreme court judge lord sumption supposedly the brainiest man in england retorts that a push for more women judges would have appalling consequences if you worry that promoting womens equality promotes the interests of those bright highearning graduates consider that women are more likely than men to be in lowpaid work more likely to head a singleparent household and more likely to live in poverty especially in their old age and in any case those bright highearning graduates will soon see their male contemporaries overtake them at the current rate it will be years before the gender pay gap closes one of the party organisers said i should ask every woman i met whether a boss had ever propositioned her i should also ask if they thought their careers had suffered because they were women male readers should try the same if they hear the answers i did they will understand why the notion of a womens equality party is not quite

service providers and experts in the field of domestic violence have welcomed a m suite of measures aimed at tackling the scourge but have urged the federal government to increase funding for legal services and womens shelters the prime minister malcolm turnbull on thursday announced several initiatives that explore the gamut of the problem from tracking perpetrators to programs which promote respectful relationships we will make it a clear national objective of ours to ensure that australia is more respecting of women turnbull told reporters in melbourne violence against women begins with disrespecting women and so this is a big cultural shift he was flanked by minister for women michaelia cash and cochairs of the council of australian governments coag advisory committee australian of the year rosie batty and former victorian police chief ken lay the announcement is turnbulls first costed policy since he came to power following a dramatic leadership spill last week and follows the recommendations of the coag committee im very pleased to say that it is the first cabinet decision of the turnbull government which is to formally endorse the m womens safety package cash said domestic violence experts have hailed the initiatives as a good start this is really positive moo baulch the chief executive of domestic violence new south wales said she particularly welcomed the shift in focus of the conversation to highlight the root causes of violent behaviour its a new chapter in our communitys understanding of domestic violence baulch said the womens minister specifically noted the importance of addressing gender inequality in stamping out domestic violence it is very moving we have still along way to go but by recognising the gender issues that exist by the prime minister stating that we need to respect and value the contribution of women as equals we have a vision of an australia that is proud of respecting women rosie batty added the royal australian college of general practitioners has welcomed an extra m for the training of frontline workers to help spot the signs of domestic violence gps are the forefront we are the doctors of first contact for many victims the head of the college frank jones said anything that helps improves patient outcomes is very welcome telephone counselling and assistance line respect received a funding boost of m karen willis who runs the counselling service said the extra money will help with the increased demand overall were averaging a increase in calls a year willis said adding that the extra demand for services does not represent an increase in incidents of violence but rather a spike in the number of women who are reporting abuse the suite of measures includes m worth of initiatives targeted at indigenous women who experience violence at a much greater rate than the wider community antoinette braybrook from the national family violence prevention legal service criticised the package for not including increased funding for legal aid services without a dedicated national program that can ensure all aboriginal and torres strait islander victims and survivors can access the holistic frontline services we provide we fear aboriginal and torres strait islander family violence will again be marginalised she said the measures include m for the creation of a dozen new onestop shops that would contain lawyers social workers and cultural liaison officers such as translators the domestic violence hubs would particularly benefit vulnerable women it will allow legal services to work with local hospitals including those used by women living in culturally and linguistically diverse communities and in regionalremote areas the president of the australian association of social workers karen healy said the federal government was forced to reverse funding cuts made to community legal centres including indigenousspecific services in the budget following a public backlash labor warned that legal centres are still underfunded i ask malcolm turnbull and the liberals congratulations on what youve done but please just find that other million youve cut because otherwise we havent even got to where we were before the election the opposition leader bill shorten told reporters while the announcement does not include extra funding for legal aid it includes the creation of legal centre domestic violence hubs this funding means that fewer women and children will need to be turned away from legal services areas serviced by these new units but what about the women and children living in other regions rosslyn monro from the national association of community legal centres said there is no extra funding either for additional womens refuges or shelters many of which turn women away on a nightly basis last year women alone the figure was turned away and we could probably easily double that if not triple that if we included children catherine gander from the new south wales womens refuge movement told abc tv i think every community is saying we need somewhere safe for women to go we have seen under the abbott government a significant reduction in community legal centres in legal aid weve seen investment in crisis accommodation and emergency housing slashed the greens leader richard di natale told reporters if youre not prepared to tackle those things then you dont have a real plan for tackling the issue of domestic violence the full list of antidomestic violence measures m for a trial of technology like gps bracelets to track perpetrators m for the distribution of safe mobile phones so that survivors can not be traced by perpetrators m extra for the safer in the home program which installs cctv cameras changes locks and undertakes safety assessments of survivors homes m boost for respect m for mensline to help stop reoffending m for queensland police to respond to reports of domestic violence in indigenous and remote communities and for programs to

northern territory m for the training of frontline staff in how to spot signs of domestic violence in survivors and perpetrators m for the creation of legal centre domestic violence hubs m for the

lady parts justice a selfdescribed cabal of prochoice comedians released a satirical app called hinder that lets you leftswipe through a whole threering circus of conservative politicians bent on curtailing reproductive freedom each pols profile has more information on his or her but probably his bad opinions on abortion sex education and women in general you can play with it on the lady parts justice site if you want to or not they support your choice but you cant find it on apples app store apple rejected hinder this month even though its guidelines explicitly allow political satire hinder is an all right app it has some things going for it ive always maintained that the best part of tinder is the ability to throw crappy people away and thats a major part of the appeal here oh look its donald trump swipe left there are also parts that could use a little work for instance the taglines that appear on each profile arent always about reproductive rights george patakis is about isis which dilutes the point also every single time you swipe left a box pops up to nag you to share on social but being merely an all right app is not what kept hinder out of the app store if that were the standard of inclusion there would be way fewer apps overall rather its been barred under apples rule against anything defamatory offensive meanspirited or likely to place the targeted individual or group in harms way let me repeat an app that accurately states politicians publicly held positions on reproductive rights and sex education is considered meanspirited and defamatory nobody who followed the siri find me an abortion story thinks this is about defamatory content if you missed it apples virtual personal assistant refused to find abortion clinics and occasionally directed people to crisis pregnancy centers which push an antichoice agenda in the guise of safeguarding womens health and its definitely not about a little salty language this is a symptom of apples ongoing hostility towards reproductive rights if you search the official store for abortion nearly every one of the results is either an antichoice app a fertility planning app or the vast majority an electronic version of a crisis pregnancy center offering soothing advice that masks an antiabortion agenda none are prochoice though a few appear to be basically neutral offering a definition of abortion essentially as part of a discussion of sexual health this is the real story not the rejection of this one rather funny novelty application but the fact that fully twothirds of the abortionrelated apps currently available are overtly or covertly antichoice anyone searching the apple store for abortion information will find dozens of apps talking about womens choices and decisionmaking keyed to crisis pregnancy centers designed to feed women misinformation about abortion and talk them into carrying a pregnancy to term at any cost prochoice brings up games like choice of zombies planned parenthood brings up the planned parenthood apps but abortion doesnt thats a big deal in the same way that manipulating google search results is a big deal the internet contains almost everything and the app store though significantly more restricted contains a lot of overlap and a great deal of dreck see choice of zombies two and a half stars our attempts to make use of these vast stores of information are mediated by search algorithms if you cant find something it may as well not exist if you want to hide something teach the algorithm to bring it up only reluctantly or not at all or as with hinder you can keep it out of the algorithms reach completely granted hinder is probably a little nastier than it has to be to get its point across you could nix about half the rude adjectives in the promotional copy and wind up with something just as true and more readable but it is in essence a mildly overwrought database and its absurd to suggest that a database collecting publicly available positions is defamatory or putting its subjects in harms way the entire point of such an app is to move its users out of harms way by giving them the chance to recognize and reject public figures who mean them harm collecting public information in an easytoaccess format is morally neutral and doing so for the protection of that public is morally good good enough in fact that it outweighs the embarrassment and in some cases even the privacy of the people listed there thats why there are sex offender locating services on the app store apples cold shoulder isnt about the rules its about maintaining a political stance and hiding anything that challenges it and while the siri slipup was sometimes generously put down to ignorance why would a company where of the technical staff is male remember that people sometimes want abortions at this point the omissions are starting to glare hinder might want to add a new profile,2015-09,lady part justice

australia has the policies and the laws to tackle an epidemic of domestic violence but is failing to implement them quentin bryce has said the former governorgeneral who oversaw a landmark domestic violence report for the queensland government this year said she feared the focus on violence against women would fade before substantial change could be achieved former sex discrimination commissioner elizabeth broderick who joined bryce to discuss domestic violence at a feminism conference in sydney agreed she said the issue was now front and centre of the national debate but could easily slip away i feel a deep centre of caution inside myself about that said bryce who has agreed to oversee the implementation of her reports recommendations i have seen again and again across my life a propensity for us to tick things off weve done sex harassment tick weve done childcare tick like equal pay we have to just keep up this momentum and pressure as well as queensland initiatives such as increasing penalties and making nonlethal strangulation a criminal offence states across the country are reviewing policies to better protect women and children victoria is holding a royal commission and there are expectations that the federal government will take further initiatives there is also pressure on canberra to reverse announced funding cuts to community organisations and legal centres both bryce and broderick said the heart of the issue was gender inequality and that education programs from an early age were critical scandinavian nations with greater equality between men and women had less domestic violence broderick said its not alcohol its not ice its not poverty at the heart of it is gender inequality she said a positive sign was that businesses that once considered the issue a private matter were now keen to be involved i hear business saying what is it that we can do they might be the only place where a woman feels safe in her daily

nimco ali observes australian feminism and shakes her head she admits shes only just arrived here but her advice to feminists would be to be a little bit more brave a little bit more bold in the uk she says theres more honesty more get out of my fucking way ali is a somaliborn british activist and survivor of female genital mutilation fgm performed on her when she was seven years old ali is fierce and has led an inyourface humorous relentless campaign against fgm in the uk she helped make the issue front page news with her fanny suit a vagina costume she wears to rallies and the muff march to protest against the growing incidence of labiaplasty in the uk after years of silence she now speaks openly about her own experience of fgm she is in australia as a keynote speaker at a conference to mark years since the publication of anne summers feminist classic damned whores and gods police its like the s here she tells guardian australia on the sidelines of the sydney conference its like germaine greers interpretation of what feminism is and that feminism doesnt sit well with me now because im straight i love men i dont see all men as rapists i dont see all men as threats its a blunt assessment of local feminism and a quick judgment but alis first impressions are that uk feminism is younger and more radical than here and more effective ali uses everything she can to draw attention to her cause she reckons australias first female defence minister marise payne should declare herself the first fanny defence minister i want her to defend women in this country and globally rather than bombing people lets talk about how we can use our military and our departments of homeland security to defend women the united nations estimates between million and million girls and women have been subjected to fgm about countries mostly in africa and the middle east practice cutting girls the procedures range from symbolic nicks to serious mutilation including the partial or complete removal of the labia minora and the clitoris alis operation was of the most serious type and she was later hospitalised elizabeth elliott professor of paediatrics and child health at the university of sydney told the conference a recent survey of australian paediatricians found had seen a girl under with fgm some had been approached to perform the procedure australian laws are similar to those in the uk fgm is illegal and there is mandatory reporting of suspected cases there are few prosecutions australias first trial is now under way although ali says a prosecution is an admission of failure protecting children is the key thing she says her fouryearold niece sofia will not be cut weve gone from to zero in our family ali dismisses the notion that cultural sensitivities need to be respected in tackling fgm that means western cultural sensitivities too she sees no distinction between fgm and cosmetic procedures such as labiaplasty where the labia minora is reduced or removed for no medical purpose its exactly the same as fgm she says anything you do to your body because patriarchy tells you is unacceptable nimco ali will be in conversation with anne summers in sydney on

theres a generational tension trend in social movements first an older generation complains that young people are apathetic even when evidence proves otherwise then when young peoples activism becomes too powerful to ignore the previous generation charges them instead with wrongheadedness and perhaps worst of all in their minds insufficient reverence to their predecessors name any activist and youll find a predecessor telling them they were wrong right now for example were seeing a slew of lefty thinkers paint college students as pampered pc babies who want trigger warnings on everything from syllabi to their lunch and most recently a former feminist idol bashing the work that came after her last week susan brownmiller the author of the book against our will men women and rape derided young antirape activists as being a historically ignorant movement that doesnt accept reality years ago the feminist author helped introduce groundbreaking ideas on rape culture that paved the way for current thinking on rape and consent so when brownmiller said its a little late for a woman to say no to sex after youre both undressed critiqued domestic violence survivors for not leaving abusive partners and women who look like a hooker the comments were met with understandable disappointment and surprise in addition to criticizing young feminists methods brownmiller claimed they think they are the first people to discover rape and the problem of consent and they are not in response kate harding author of asking for it wrote we have to be ready to let go of our heroes and at slate amanda marcotte called it a case study in the importance of not having heroes but brownmillers tonedeaf interview is more than just a lesson in the danger of creating social movement icons its a reminder for those with their heydey behind them that young people do not make you irrelevant living in your own bubble does in for example then naral prochoice america president nancy keenan told newsweek that the only people fighting for abortion rights were those in the postmenopausal milita at the time of the employees of her organization were under years old and there was a vibrant feminist and prochoice resurgence online mostly founded by younger women and last month writer and s civil rights activist barbara reynolds criticized the black lives matter movement for among other things holding demonstrations she claimed were peppered with hate speech profanity and guys with sagging pants if this young movement had embraced the wellmeaning advice of its elders earlier instead of responding with disdain it could have spent recent months making headway with political leaders instead of battling the disheartening images of violence and destruction that have followed its protests against police brutality in black neighborhoods young activists do the work they do not in spite of what came before but because of it still younger people shouldnt have to constantly pay homage to older generations the fact that theyre doing the work is tribute enough i can empathize with the fear of being made to feel irrelevant to a movement youve dedicated your life to i get it its a strange to thing to go from a young whippersnapper with new ideas to a movement veteran but just because new or younger activists may use different methods than we would doesnt mean that theyre wrong sometimes they are though and could use the knowledge that comes with experience but no young person is going to hear advice that comes with a fingerwagging rather than openness when we dismiss younger peoples ideas instead of engaging with them seriously that is the moment we make ourselves a cliche and yes irrelevant im not suggesting some sort of logans run age cutoff for activists or public intellectuals i know that i plan to contribute to feminism until my last breath but while some peoples best work comes from decades of experience some comes from new sets of eyes there are many seasoned activists and thinkers who recognize this those who dont are only hurting themselves because like it or not the movement will go on without us,2015-09,generational tension trend social

that despite the significant societal technological and cultural changes of the last years women are still demanding greater equality and fighting for the issues that are important to them and their

in all the great labour furore harriet harman has slipped away to the backbenches but as she goes pause a moment to celebrate one of the most remarkable parliamentary careers few politicians leave much of an imprint let alone a legacy they occupy the space and then they go but she has made more impact not just on parliament but on womens lives everywhere than any other politician of her generation since the suffragettes no feminist battles have ever been won without brave women prepared to take brickbats of abuse and mockery harperson sneering demands the thickest of skins to plough on winning a byelection back in she arrived in the male commons seven months pregnant a somewhat ridiculed spectacle before she had even opened her mouth to let them know she was there as the political wing of the burgeoning feminist movement outside to be sure there was a woman prime minister a queen bee no feminist hoots of derision greeted harriets first question to margaret thatcher asking about the lack of childcare provision in school holidays as most parents work to support their families thatcher replied no i do not believe that it is up to the government to provide care for schoolchildren during the school holidays shaken by the contempt from her own side for asking an absurd and irrelevant question she drew support to keep going from the womens movement outside parliament labour mps were outraged when she founded the womens parliamentary labour party group for the beleaguered women mps its easy to forget the ferocity of antiwomen antifeminist feeling in the male labour ranks it was all mines money supply and motorways harman says of the s when she defiantly campaigned on domestic violence womens refuges and reforming laws that let womenmurdering men claim provocation and infidelity as grounds to get charges reduced to manslaughter as shadow employment minister she fought for labours adoption of the national minimum wage most of the low paid are women she invented the low pay commission opposed by union leaders who protested that it undermined their collective bargaining barbara castle had faced the same union objections over equal pay theres no room to mark all of the harman battles won but remember how labour men fought against her allwomen shortlists which changed the male face of the commons now of labour mps are women though still only of the commons what a backward step to see jeremy corbyn ignore women for the top jobs womens steps forward always need guarding against backsliding harman along with margaret hodge has also been a great encourager of other women nurturing new arrivals and celebrating younger upandcomers more women mps changed the political agenda maternity pay and time have doubled during her time in parliament and even the tories are promising increased childcare as social security secretary harman persuaded a reluctant gordon brown that childcare was crucial to getting mothers into work numbers rose fast under her new deal for single parents she was so often first to ask the woman question her mockingly titled ftse womens index first counted women on boards she first counted the lack of women councillors and she put the equality act on the statute book the mocking never stops but her pink bus was the only vibrant bit of a dead election campaign i saw the bus bring women flocking to talk about their issues through originality effrontery and sheer keeping going through a barrage of abuse she has changed politics more than any other woman and yet harman left her role as interim leader under an unfair cloud she went with the majority shadow cabinet view to abstain on the welfare bill trying to avoid a tory trap to make them vote against m apprenticeships and lowering council rents and putting down an anticuts amendment instead but that parliamentary technicality was overwhelmed by the surge of political indignation harman is now taking up the chair of the human rights select committee where she returns to her first work as a human rights lawyer she is also writing her autobiography if these are usually preening lists of achievements then she has earned a right to that harman barely rates a mention in the mens autobiographies of the labour years blair brown cook blunkett and the rest have wiped her out of history neither does the labour womens struggle or its part in labours success feature in their landscape but harman was never part of the establishment instead she was always the outsider away in a womens zone thats often the fate of the bravest feminists here is a flavour of just how much harman changed in she dared ask a tory minister if he thought it right that women in the population where they form a majority should be so overwhelmingly represented by men sir nicolas bonsor replied as from another planet it is entirely for the ladies to decide for whom they vote and that marks a crucial victory ever since women won the vote more of them voted tory than did men but was the watershed where for the first time ever more women voted labour as they have done ever since would that seismic change have happened if harman hadnt pioneered

deborah orr is right to be troubled by the domination of male leaders in the trade union and labour movement opinion september no modernday labour movement political party or trade union can thrive without womens support and representation all the more reason for a woman to lead the largest public service union and work with jeremy corbyn and his team on the issues facing public service workers as female activists academics and trade unionists we therefore welcome the decision by heather wakefield head of local government at unison to stand in unisons general secretary election as orr suggests it is time for a union whose membership is threequarters female to be led by a woman and crucially one who can offer unity of the left and who has the experience and leadership skills for the job heather has campaigned in the trade union womens and labour movements for over years for fair and equal pay parental rights womens representation and for public services and public service workers to be properly valued she is working to defend adult social care now a privatised service that is recognised to be in danger of collapse and which must be a priority for the labour movement here as elsewhere women are both frontline public service providers and public service users as such they bear the brunt of the governments ideologically driven austerity policies women need collective and concerted action by publicsector trade unions to defend democratically accountable public services and the workers within them we have every confidence that heather wakefield can lead unison as part

corbyn to respond to requests to promote more women given that generation of female mps came into the party as blairites rather than traditional labour reps few or even none of these women even questioned the media labelling of blair babes if corbyn was to promote these candidates he would immediately be accused of subverting the wishes of the grassroots who put him in the job as a black briton i would like to see more ethnic diversity in the shadow cabinet but i am realistic that the previous blairite regime did not allow many black reallabour mps to flourish in the short term there is little the corbynwatson team can do until some form of reselection has taken place gavin lewis manchester a labour shadow cabinet with women in charge of health education business defence energy transport environment and food international development and the whole of wales and people are grousing that women werent given the important jobs deirdre mason london i wonder what the shadow cabinet members who are refusing to serve under jeremy corbyn would have done if they had been labour mps in that was the year in which the party conference overwhelmingly carried a resolution setting out a sweepingly radical programme for a future labour government the programme that was largely carried out by clement attlees postwar government herbert morrison home secretary in the wartime coalition complemented the mover of the motion on the excellence of his speech but added of course you realise you have just lost us the election in the event labour won by a landslide no one not even morrison refused to serve in attlees cabinet ian aitken london i hope the headline to zoe williams article proves correct by ripping up the rulebook corbyn is redefining our politics september but she is wrong when she goes on to say i dont care whether corbyn can win a general election something seismic has happened within the labour party but taking power from the tories is the real tectonic shift that labour must strive for what purpose is served by an opposition party that does not seek to win the power to implement its policies and ideas if the tories do not fear losing to labour then we are not being an effective opposition what is to hold the tories back if they know they cannot lose rather than being the champions of the weak and the disadvantaged we would be wilfully abandoning them to perpetual misery under an unbridled tory government to be an effective opposition we will need the support of moderateminded party supporters the moderate majority within the parliamentary labour party has always understood this necessity building broad support is not about resurrecting the outdated doctrines rejected so emphatically by labour members as zoe assumes jeremy too has shown that he understands this by appointing a shadow cabinet representative of a broad spectrum of opinions almost people did not join the labour party just to have a good debate and let the tories rule they want to win the keys to no clive efford mp labour eltham could there be anything more important for labour than to engage young voters a shadow cabinet post with this intention could be seen to be vital for the future of engaged politics having criticised the media for castigating jeremy corbyns lack of mediasavvy tactics in appointing white male cabinet ministers first gaby hinsliff opinion september falls into exactly the same trap of misjudgment it is clear from a lot of the press coverage and the poor behaviour of some labour mps that the positive potential of the changes that are

this morning i opened my email account to find another death threat the sender said they knew where i live and work they said they would be waiting within two months they would cut off my head and place it in a plastic bag and my head would be their prize possession my head my body their possession my offence last week i refused to accept a sexist and demeaning message sent to me by a senior lawyer via linkedin i tweeted it along with my response i believed i had the right as i believe any woman has the right to challenge sexism in the workplace and on professional social media calling out a single instance of sexism in a professional space hit a nerve far deeper than i ever imagined why has one tweet that sought to challenge the objectification of women in professional spaces caused a furore the truth is i have committed a double transgression not only have i refused to passively accept being objectified i have also refused to apologise for having the temerity to take a stand what i did therefore was doubly threatening to vested power it is a tragic irony that the misogynist abuse i have endured is an attempt to reassert the patriarchal status quo in which women in the public space are to be seen but not heard my tweet sought to assert that i refuse to be seen through my body but instead my body my image my physical appearance were microanalysed and displayed i was dismissed as a glam lawyer trolls described me as an ugly ballbusting bitch a munter you can imagine the rest with depressing inevitability people enjoying the privilege of an imbalance of power felt threatened by one minor attempt to argue for social change it has played out in lurid technicolor across the national media the most toxic debate of the year claimed the daily mail where do you stand it asked readers the backlash has included the classic manoeuvre reframing sexist messaging as innocuously harmless compliments why all the fuss should women not be grateful that theyre being complimented on their looks by strangers particularly by powerful senior men let me be clear the compliments i receive from friends or family and those i choose to give are a private matter i do not welcome unsolicited remarks about my body from someone i dont know and who in a professional context is in a position of authority over me sexist comments are part of the process that seals and cements womens subordinate position to men in the workplace yet many professional women believe that because of their relative disempowerment they simply have to tolerate such intrusive and oppressive behaviour after all it is just casual everyday sexism just a bit of fun properly understood however it constitutes social policing gender control and in its darker manifestations a hidden form of social violence we have to fully recognise this fact and take it seriously before we can change it instead of addressing the insidious nature of sexism in the workplace the rightwing media attempted to ridicule berate and attack me they created their very own charlotte proudman that charlotte is a manhater and yet the real charlotte had never uttered a word of hatred towards men i was dubbed a feminazi consider the terms core components femi half a feminist and nazi they raked over my private life published untruthful material about me and my family and harassed and distressed my relatives and friends after the negative coverage came the barrage of misogynistic abuse and death threats from trolls but you can do these things with impunity to a feminazi as the subliminal messaging goes the feminazi deserves it why because she did not stay silent my future silence would be their victory but the abuse and threats will not deter me they perfectly encapsulate what is wrong with the way women in the workplace are viewed and i am more determined than ever to fight for progressive social causes i hope that the backlash i have endured will not deter other women from challenging sexism no one should be silenced for fear of standing up for what they believe in i have received countless messages of support from women and men across the world i was touched when a father contacted me to say thank you on behalf of my daughters another man told me i was a role model and he would be proud if his daughters would take a stand like me one woman thanked me for inspiring her and for giving her confidence another said she received sexist messages all the time and i have encouraged her to go public about the abuse a woman messaged me to say that a man in a senior position at her work made sexist comments about her physical appearance when she informed her boss she was told not to take it seriously other women are contacting me to ask how they can call out sexism without fear of recrimination i cant sugarcoat this i would never want any woman to face what i have endured in challenging sexism but if we genuinely want to eradicate everyday sexism at work we need a zerotolerance policy and i encourage women and men to support one another in identifying and challenging sexism in all professional contexts we will only get the equality we fight for it will not come easily and it will not be painless but if we are to value and respect women in the workplace that fight is ahead of us,2015-09,morning opened email account find another death threat sender said knew live work said

in the united states unlike any other country in the world except papua new guinea a centralized paid maternity leave policy does not exist two weeks ago when yahoo ceo marissa mayer announced she was pregnant with twins but would be taking very limited maternity leave and working throughout her time off the yearold was widely criticized for propagating a culture which expects superwomanhood or nothing but is mayer herself the epitome of a woman at the top to blame for unrealistic expectations how are other women leaders coping seema patel mother of two seema patel a lawyer and deputy director of san franciscos office of labor standards enforcement was taking her first steps at a government job in washington dc a few years ago when her then boss sat her down with an unexpected piece of advice i dont know anything about you her boss said but if you have any plans to have a family in the future start saving your leave right now patels employer was the federal government and she didnt get a day of paid maternity leave as part of her work arrangement back then patel was unmarried and very careerfocused and a family was the last thing on her mind but diligently she took her bosss word for it she avoided using her sick days over the course of four years so that when she eventually did have her first child two years ago she had accumulated enough to get three months paid time off when she had her second baby six months ago patel could not pull the same trick the four months she took off were entirely unpaid patel says she experienced no pushback from colleagues but it is the work structure she has an issue with i find it extremely unsupportive for anyone trying to have family she says it sends a message your country does not value you becoming a parent karen choi mother of four karen choi a vicepresident at asset management firm capital group says that any working woman who is a mother should be applauded choi who has four children including a sixmonthold baby describes juggling being a mother and a job a constant struggle secrets for keeping your head above water include having an unbelievably supportive family as well as a nanny and babysitter accepting that there are some areas you are not going to be the best at not everyone can be the martha of home dcor and simply getting through it choi says she took more maternity leave with every child she had starting with two and a half months with her first child and taking six months off with her latest this makes her an exception especially within her industry when your child is sick has fever is throwing up and you are up all night taking care of your child and knowing that the next morning you have to get your other kids to school and then you have to go to work thats when it gets to be very challenging she says her firm was supportive though and she stresses her investment portfolios performance did not suffer at all when she entered the finance industry after university about or so of her female college mates chose the same path she says today about of them have left women who exit jobs and then reenter are likely to no longer be on track for peak earning positions she says staying is tough a sacrifice in the short term but it pays in the long term if nothing else her children have helped provide meaning for this sacrifice she says because all four of her children are daughters one of the things that keeps me going is the fact that i would like to be a role model to them kelly posner mother of four the notion of being a role model to her four children is also what drives yearold research scientist and professor kelly posner they know that their mom is out there literally helping to save lives posner who is the founder and director of the center for suicide risk assessment at columbia university says it is important for women to know that they can have a big goal careerwise and achieve it it is very important for women to believe that they can have a vision most women do not allow themselves to think that she says she once gave a presentation to people including government officials in italy over a webinar while eight months pregnant technology has also helped she says with the ability to stop the car and take a call after picking her kids up or to answer an email on the go juggling motherhood with a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic problemsolving disposition she says an ability to get through things even when they feel impossible jennifer eppsaddison mother of two jennifer eppsaddison the executive director of wisconsin jobs now and a mother of two says that only being able to make career and motherhood work together thanks to private networks of help like nannies is wrong you shouldnt have to get lucky or win the lottery to be able to succeed she says describing the systemic failure to support women and families citing oppressively low wages a flawed health care system and a lack of mandated paid maternity leave as a society we are not taking care of each other she says we cannot even guarantee mothers who have just birthed a child to recuperate eppsaddison who was pregnant while attending law school gave birth to one of her children while she was on a fellowship with a husband and offspring relying on the healthcare provided by the fellowship the labor leader was only able to take two weeks maternity leave she says before returning to work lisa mosko mother of two lisa mosko a fashion stylist and mother of two says fewer women would be leaving their professions if more societal support were available in the form of company daycares keeping to agreedon schedules and accepting that good work does not mean overtime on top of logistical constraints mosko says she has the added pressure of being in an industry where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of unsophisticated mom clothes being among the worst insults image is part of your job it can make or break you she explains moskos constant negotiation of making her multiple roles work in harmony involves keeping to her chic appearance beautiful handbag on hand but sometimes having a toy or two fall out of them remembering men are fathers too might help society cut women some slack she says people dont judge men for being bad dads as much as moms shola olatoye mother of three shola olatoye the chair and ceo of new yorks housing authority which houses around new yorkers and employs over people says that talking about balance is not really what motherhood and career is about the notion of balance is a bit of a misnomer its more like a seesaw she says the mother of three including one threemonthold took just seven weeks maternity leave when she gave birth this year it was a very important time for the agency she explains she says she knew seven weeks wasnt enough but her husband was able to take paternity leave and she has been able to have access to a flexible schedule that includes leaving early or coming in later so as to pump milk for her baby indeed olatoye who goes on runs with her girlfriends every morning that end at am cheaper than therapy is still nursing on the job she has tried to create an environment that is parentfriendly where coming in late because of a kid is fine and answering emails does not have to be done from within the office walls the concept and notion of family has changed and is changing so much olatoye says the family is very different from what it was like hell years ago she says its the workplace that has to adapt,2015-09,united state unlike country

much has been written about the labour party and women in recent days yet almost entirely missing from the debate has been an honest assessment of our record in promoting gender equality not just in changing the political culture of our country but in transforming the lives of countless women across the uk lets look at the scorecard introducing the minimum wage creating tax credits increased maternity and paternity leave and pay pension credit expanded childcare the equality act these things have all made a massive difference to women in this country and it was a labour government that achieved them it wasnt the tories and it certainly wasnt the snp of course it would have been great if there were more women in the most senior posts in jeremy corbyns shadow cabinet but the majority of people sitting around the top table will be women thats something to celebrate when you consider the two frontbenches in the house of commons there can be no doubt which party has the proudest record of promoting women to senior roles more than of labours mps are women thats because we introduced allwomen shortlists before other parties even considered them i want us to reach and soon but is a good base from which to build its also worth gently reminding people that the labour party doesnt start and end with the house of commons just over a month ago i was elected as scottish labour leader it was and is a great honour what was most remarked upon at the time was my age rather than my gender thats because we have a strong record of electing women to the top job in scottish labour i am the third female leader of scottish labour following in the footsteps of johann lamont and wendy alexander we should however never fall into the trap of thinking that electing a female leader is enough on its own it isnt we need women in positions of power to ensure a feminist agenda is pursued but we shouldnt think having a woman in a position of power equals feminism for the last eight years in scotland the first minister or deputy has been a woman has that transformed the lives of women living here no it hasnt the number of women studying the subjects needed for the jobs of the future science technology engineering and maths still lags well behind men under the snp government there are fewer people going to college these cuts have had a serious impact on women in parttime and evening classes more important than many women in top jobs are the policies we pursue as a party securing leadership roles for women is of course vital but it cant be an end in itself today the labour party will provide the main opposition to the unfair tory cuts to tax credits which disproportionately impact women in scotland alone there are almost families in receipt of tax credits david camerons plan backed by his scottish cheerleader ruth davidson would be a disaster for millions of women across the uk thats where a partys record on equality really counts we put our money where our mouth is while the tories want to take money away from women already struggling to make ends meet there is so much to do to achieve equality in the uk i want girls going to school today to grow up in a world where they can look at the boy across the desk from them and know that when they grow up they can both be anything they want to be i want young women to enter adulthood knowing that their ability to get on in life is determined by their potential and ambition not by their gender or how much money their parents have almost every major piece of social and economic progress for women in this country has been as a result of a united labour movement girls and young women across the uk need us to work together they wont forgive us if instead of standing up for them we disagree among ourselves,2015-09,much ha written labour party woman recent day yet almost entirely missing debate ha honest assessment record promoting gender equality changing political culture country transforming

like charlotte proudman who legitimately challenged irrelevant remarks made about her appearance on linkedin you dont take sexist comments with a pinch of salt you can tell the difference between a compliment in a social setting and an unsolicited rating of your appearance in a professional context from a man more than twice your age even though this is apparently a hugely complex and baffling distinction you find the term feminazi mildly offensive given that it seems to equate the quest for gender equality to the holocaust and all as a casual observer you once commented perhaps lightheartedly on social media about a sexist comment someone made only to see media outlets doorstep his wife publish facebook photos of his daughter whip up a publicity storm and then blame it all on the fact that you and five other people expressed your opinions on twitter you dirty twitchforker you you think its pretty unfair that women effectively work from november until the end of the year for free because of the gender pay gap and that female managers work for free for nearly two hours a day and that the pay gap is even wider for women of colour and disabled women oh and that women lose their jobs to maternity discrimination each year youre concerned that in women still make up fewer than a third of mps fewer than a quarter of professors and one fifth of high court judges write just one in five front page newspaper articles and lead fewer ftse companies than men named john youre angry about the women raped and sexually assaulted in the uk every year it troubles you that of all sexual offences reported to the police are recorded as no crimes that rape victims face public blame and ridicule and that conviction rates for rape in the uk are among the lowest in europe youre outraged that two women every week are killed in england and wales by a current or former partner you dont feel like outrage is too strong a word to use in this context it strikes you as irrational that you live in a country where one in three girls experiences unwanted sexual touching at school yet the curriculum doesnt guarantee that young people will learn about healthy relationships and sexual consent you believe that in a world where women routinely face discrimination sexual assault and violence it makes sense to challenge every instance of gender inequality even the minor ones because they are part of the wider imbalanced structure and help to maintain the attitudes that allow the larger transgressions to flourish but whatever you do dont you dare speak out because thats

a raft of highly publicised cases of violence against women in queensland has sparked an outpouring of public concern and political impetus to act on what highprofile campaigner rosie batty has called an epidemic things came to a head in a horrific confluence of events on thursday karina lock was allegedly shot dead in a gold coast mcdonalds restaurant by her estranged husband stephen who then turned a gun on himself lock had reportedly moved to the coast to escape her abusive partner who died in hospital on friday also on thursday tara brown died from a catastrophic head injury allegedly inflicted by the father of her child lionel patea patea had allegedly followed brown by car from a childcare centre run her off the road and beaten her with a metal object as she lay injured in her wrecked mazda brown reportedly had gone to police a week earlier to seek protection from patea a former bandidos bikie but was advised to find help elsewhere hours before locks death brisbane woman zarah farah abdi was allegedly attacked with a machete by an expartner who was subdued by neighbours with a wooden table leg and a wheelie bin the previous evening on the gold coast a yearold woman turned up to hospital in a taxi with a gunshot wound to her buttocks at one point on thursday afternoon the five top stories on the brisbane times website were all about female victims of violence brisbanes couriermail newspaper responded on friday with a frontpage headlined stand up in which a group of prominent queenslanders in sport media and politics called for a statewide campaign to stop domestic violence the twitter response from northern territory senator nova peris to the couriermail splash captured the mixed feelings of some at the coalface towards such public awareness campaigns we stand up then what on the statistics domestic and family violence is a disproportionate problem in queensland reported incidents have risen by more than a quarter over the past three years to more than in queensland had more domestic violence reports than any other australian state except victoria where there were million more people but only just over more reports the states new labor government led by annastacia palaszczuk was already moving on the issue having vowed to adopt all recommendations of the landmark not now not ever report on family violence by australias former governorgeneral quentin bryce a new domestic violence court which aims to better deal with the needs of victims began running in recent weeks ironically on the gold coast but the sudden emergence of a few shocking cases has lent new urgency to the response batty the nations best known antifamily violence campaigner following the death of her son luke at the hands of her late husband added her voice to australias top trending twitter hashtag stoptheviolence on friday yes its a family violence epidemic queensland greens senator larissa waters said it had been a tragic week in queenslands history and must never be repeated a series of likely and unlikely figures have joined a chorus for men to effect cultural change and renounce violence darren lockyer a former champion of one of australian sports more violent arenas rugby league called on men to get serious about treating other human beings with respect especially our women and children browns death prompted a similar public outpourings in her native new zealand including from onetime australian idol contestant stan walker himself a former gold coast resident take a look at this beautiful young mother she died last night fighting for her life in hospital walker said on twitter this breaks my heart man i cant stand this crap we cannot let this happen ever again even figures from the outlaw motorcycle world no stranger to troubled men of violent disposition have been moved to publicly express dismay at the deaths of lock and brown one allegedly at the hands of a former member of their fraternity united motorcycle council president and rebels bikie mick kosenko said he and others were sickened by the whole thing just terrible kosenko said he had seen several members of his own club turn their backs on violence towards their loved ones with both the support and the opprobrium when necessary of their peers you just gotta listen to them dont you and if they are going off the rails you try weve had members ourselves we had to pull into line threaten them with getting thrown out of the club take their colours off them for three months and then they realise fuck what have i done palaszczuk who said she was horrified by the alleged murders of lock and brown has now promised to fasttrack the adoption of bryces remaining recommendations significantly palaszczuk promised to arm dv connect the states only sizeable family violence crisis support service with whatever funding it needed waters welcomed palaszczuks commitment to more funding for dv connect and called for more federal funding in the same vein frontline staff at womens call centres refuges and legal services work tirelessly stretching limited resources to help the tragically high numbers of women coming to them in fear of their lives and those of their children she said it is the paucity of refuge options for women and their children in the throes of initial crisis that is the gaping sore in the current system according to social workers lyn anderson runs helem yumba the states only indigenous specific domestic violence prevention service in the heart of central queensland where reported rates of domestic violence are the highest in the community anderson said it was clear there was a chronic lack of capacity at womens refuges and in overworked services like dv connect the key answer to safeguarding women and children in danger from abusive partners was straightforward more money and resources anderson said it was also clear that public awareness campaigns in spite of their unifying effect in some elements of the community were missing the mark with those who mattered this was particularly so in vulnerable people under who made up what she said was an alarming rise in the proportion of victims and perpetrators of family violence anderson said she had mixed feelings about the surge of publicity this week in view of the fact horrific incidents continue to happen daily the callouts for queensland police to domestic violence reports now top a day which is approaching a third of the national total those two really high profile cases are horrific and im glad it got so much coverage but im just wondering will it be featured in the media for a couple of days and then die away the interest will go anderson told guardian australia in rockhampton recently we had an indigenous girl under the age of badly beaten sexually assaulted and when she left hospital she really had nowhere to go except to the park our service doesnt deal with crisis but luckily dv connect came through for us but without dv connect or services like mine where do women go the womens shelter was full so they come to us we dip into our own resources to put them into hotels one young lady we actually paid for her to go into rehab because it was either there or in the park central queensland the states hotspot for both the maledominated mining industries and domestic violence had only one womens shelter which was invariably full anderson said the alternative was putting families on buses or trains to other towns which perpetuates a victims feeling of isolation making it even more likely for her to seek to rekindle an abusive relationship with no resolution of the issues there was also a fundamental problem with putting the onus on removing victims and their children from communities rather than the perpetrators my cousin works at an indigenous community in far north queensland and a woman was badly beaten just recently and is in a womens shelter and theyre looking to remove her from the community anderson said why does she have to go why cant they get the bugger who beat the crap out of her out of the community so her children can stay and get up and go to school in the morning another mother of seven was sent from rockhampton to the isolated community of biloela by weekends end despair and loneliness had driven to phone up her abusive partner who promptly drove and picked her and the kids up and it started all over again if youre going to remove a woman and kids make sure you support her its human instinct to go back to whats familiar anderson said it raised the question of why more could not be done to safeguard a womans return to her home and supporting a male abuser who may be taken elsewhere to deal with his issues its about injecting more resources into the community to keep women and children safe anderson said you can take them to a womens shelter or a safe house whilst there are security upgrades on her home whilst they remove that fellow from the vicinity so she and her children can go home the other issue is hes got nowhere to go so hes just going to cycle back home and shes going to fell sorry for him and let him in we need to then look at how to support these men so theyve got somewhere to go where services can access them and start working with them so they can change their behaviours it was a crucial issue as we know nine out of women go back to abusive partners anderson said she said there was also a role of more police vigilance about warning signs that women are in danger with tara brown she was in a metropolis and she allegedly went to the police how did we as a community allow her to slip through the net deputy police commissioner brett pointing said it was inappropriate for him to comment on browns dealing with police while it was under internal and external investigation but pointing who is tasked with helping lead cultural change within the force on how to deal with domestic violence matters said he was focused on how do we tighten our governance structures so very important domestic violence matters dont fall through the cracks in the main men and women in the queensland police service are very committed to investigating domestic violence but wed be nave to say that everything is perfect he said pointing said he was looking at how to put handling of domestic violence matters at the centre of performance reviews for officers theres an old saying what gets measured gets done police were also looking at how to make better use of referral agencies as well as improve procedures around bail applications for alleged offenders and powers where appropriate to arrest offenders instead of issuing notices to appear in court asked about queenslands disproportionately high number of domestic and family violence incidents pointing said he had no definitive explanation but he said it was possible the state had a broader legal definition of the offences than other jurisdictions which may skew the numbers in view of the public discussions around domestic violence including campaigns such as the couriermails supported by top queenslanders anderson said it was her observation the message is still not getting out there you may have a whole range of public awareness campaigns but they are missing the mark she said suggesting policy makers needed to work out how to reach a new generation of people who rely less on mainstream media for information when we talk to young people about awareness that domestic violence is wrong you have a right as a woman to be safe and this is the law theres

when i started researching domestic violence last year i thought i basically understood it some men driven to distress by things such as unemployment substance abuse or mental illness were unable to control their anger and took it out on the person they loved the most weve all said and done things were not proud of in relationships i thought domestic violence was just the extreme extension of that it took about two weeks for that notion to be demolished dozens of conversations with survivors and advocates revealed a very different reality and understanding it was like being given the key to a secret room domestic violence is not driven by anger first and foremost its driven by a need for and a sense of entitlement to power and control but someone with such a powerful drive to control would surely reveal that at work or around friends i thought but i wasnt right about that either sometimes they do but often perpetrators come across as normal good people even pillars of the community it wasnt until id spent months researching and writing about it that i began to understand why most people dont get domestic violence it doesnt make sense the traits are often entirely counterintuitive and attempts to look at it through the lens of common sense can actually drive you further from the truth it doesnt make sense that even women who are smart and independent will stay with a man who treats them like dirt it doesnt make sense that even after fleeing a woman is likely to return to that man six times on average it mustnt be that bad people say it doesnt make sense that someone you know to be a good bloke could be going home to hold a knife to his wifes throat none of it makes sense but the more you learn about the nature of domestic violence the more sense you can make of it for me a big pennydropping moment was reading trauma and recovery judith hermans landmark book on understanding psychological trauma in it she equates the experiences of domestic violence victims to those of prisoners of war in both situations establishing control over the other person is achieved through the systematic repetitive infliction of psychological trauma designed to instill fear and helplessness survivors who have escaped this systematic abuse often emerge from it confused and utterly disoriented tragically that means they often dont present as credible witnesses in their posttraumatic state their stories can be fragmented highly emotional and contradictory in the court system especially in cases determining the custody of children victims can appear mentally disturbed and overly anxious especially compared to their expartners who come across as composed and reasonable in a system where most lawyers and judicial staff are not trained to recognise the signs of family violence victims even ones with court orders on their side can find themselves being accused of making up allegations to gain advantage according to a survey by vichealth a statutory health authority in victoria of australians think women going through custody battles make up or exaggerate claims of domestic violence in order to improve their case until i started researching this phenomenon i believed that too whats even more confusing is that commonly perpetrators believe they are the victim and will plead their case to police even as their partner stands bloody and bruised behind them they can genuinely believe their partner provoked them to commit the abuse just so they could get them in trouble after a while the victims start to blame themselves for the abuse too after all hes so nice to everybody else the fact domestic violence is so counterintuitive is exactly why the media needs to keep telling these stories but we journalists need education on it too so we dont continue to make the same old mistakes never again should we see journalists looking to the behaviour of the woman to explain why she has been murdered or maimed never again should we see journalists making excuses for men who kill their families as though stress could ever be a reasonable excuse the work is hard but it is worth it looking around at the room full of domestic violence advocates and survivors at last nights our watch awards launched this year in collaboration with the walkley awards to recognise reporting on violence against women it really hit me how important this work is domestic violence doesnt make sense but for these people and for the thousands who are suffering in silence at this very moment we need to make sense of it jess hill is an investigative

it shouldnt be a surprise that im not fond of comments sections i think youd be hardpressed to find many female writers who are on most sites from youtube to local newspapers comments are a place where the most noxious thoughts rise to the top and smart conversations are lost in a sea of garbage theres a reason after all that the refrain dont read the comments has become ubiquitous among journalists but if were not to read them why have them at all i wasnt always a commentshater when i started a feminist blog in i was thrilled to finally be able to talk with other young feminists online and was open to chatting with detractors i saw the comments section as a way to destabilize the traditional writerreader relationship no longer did audiences need to consume an article without a true opportunity to respond comments even made my writing better those days feedback from readers broadened the way i thought and sometimes changed my mind but as the internet and audiences grew so did the bile now if feels as if comments uphold power structures instead of subverting them sexism racism and homophobia are the norm threats and harassment are common thats not even counting social media for writers wading into comments doesnt make a lot of sense its like working a second shift where you willingly subject yourself to attacks from people you have never met and hopefully never will especially if you are a woman as laurie penny has written an opinion it seems is the short skirt of the internet having one and flaunting it is somehow asking an amorphous mass of almostentirely male keyboardbashers to tell you how theyd like to rape kill and urinate on you the problem is so bad that online harassment is a keynote subject this year at the online news association conference my own exhaustion with comments these days has less to do with explicit harassment which at places like the guardian is swiftly taken care of thank you moderators rather its the neverending stream of derision that women people of color and other marginalized communities endure the constant insistence that you or what you write is stupid or that your platform is undeserved yes im sure straight white male writers get this kind of response too but its not nearly as often and not nearly as nasty i dont much understand the appeal of comments for readers either outside of the few places that have rich and intelligent conversation in comments what is the point of engaging in debate where the best you can hope for are a few pats on the back from strangers for that pithy oneliner isnt that what facebook or twitter is for seriously when tech news website recode shut down its comments section last year editors cited the growth of social media as one reason for the decision the bulk of discussion of our stories is increasingly taking place there making onsite comments less and less used and less and less useful comments sections also give the impression that all thoughts are created equal when well theyre not when popular science stopped publishing comments for example it was because everything from evolution to the origins of climate change is mistakenly up for grabs againscientific certainty is just another thing for two people to debate when will we see the humanity and dignity of women as a fact rather than an opinion its true i could just stop reading comments but i shouldnt have to ignoring hateful things doesnt make them go away and telling women to simply avoid comments is just another way of saying were too lazy or overwhelmed to fix the real problem websites and news sources are increasingly moving forward without comments because they find them unnecessary and counterproductive in my perfect world more places would follow their lead at least until publishers find lasting solutions to making comments worth it worth it for readers and for writers because the nastiness on our doorstep has piled too high for too long and i just want to get out of the house,2015-09,shouldnt surprise im fond comment section think youd hardpressed find many female writer site youtube local newspaper comment place noxious thought rise top smart conversation

at least british children are growing up as skype kids because an immigration income threshold does not allow both of their parents to live together in britain a childrens commissioner report has found the research by the joint council for the welfare of immigrants jcwi and middlesex university shows that thousands of british families have been affected by a home office minimum income threshold of a year for sponsoring a foreign spouse to live in the uk which was introduced in the report family friendly says the introduction of the threshold has resulted in separation for thousands of british families in which one parent is not entitled to live in the uk most of the children in the survey affected by the changes are themselves british citizens and many have suffered distress and anxiety as a result of separation from a parent the research confirms that the minimum income threshold for a uk citizen to bring a foreign spouse or partner from outside europe to live in britain on a family visa would not be met by almost half of the adult population the threshold is too high and is discriminatory british citizens who have lived and worked abroad and formed longterm relationships abroad are particularly penalised and find it very difficult to return to the uk says the report published on wednesday anne longfield the childrens commissioner for england said there was a wealth of evidence indicating that children were far more likely to thrive when raised by parents in a warm stable and loving family environment i am therefore very concerned that the immigration rules introduced in july actively drive families apart and leave british children able to communicate with one parent only via skype said longfield many of the children interviewed for this research suffer from stress and anxiety affecting their wellbeing and development it is also likely to have an impact on their educational attainment and outcomes because they have been separated from a parent due to these inflexible rules which take little account of regional income levels or family support available saira grant the jcwis legal director said in an ongoing attempt to reduce migration the government has introduced rules which are now adversely impacting on british citizen families and children this must surely be an unintended consequence but one that must now be urgently addressed a home office spokeswoman said those who wished to make a life in the uk with their family work hard and make a contribution were welcomed but family life must not be established here at the taxpayers expense that is why we established clear rules for british citizens looking to bring their noneu spouse to this country including a minimum income threshold based on advice from the independent migration advisory committee the spokeswoman said the level of the minimum income threshold reflects the income at which a british family generally ceases to be able to access incomerelated benefits the policy has been approved by parliament and upheld by the courts as lawful and compliant with our legal duty to safeguard and promote child welfare,2015-09,least british

twins with two weeks maternity leave while working throughout news of yahoo ceo marissa mayers pregnancy announced on her tumblr blog was greeted with hoots of derision and anger why goes the argument shouldnt a woman ceo take her full entitlement of maternity leave and if she doesnt take it what is she saying to a the other women who work in her company and b male ceos who might want to take some time off to be with their families what shes saying is this is how i want to do things you fight your own battles ive got twins on the way plus a threeyearold already im going to work this out in a way that suits me newsflash move over gordon gekko women can be fat cat capitalist bastards too this should not be shocking what is shocking is how harshly a woman is judged for it a woman in power is seen first and foremost as a woman rather than as a leader with all the assumptions that we make about that role leaders can often be difficult obstreperous or psychopathic why shouldnt women be those things too mayer may not even go the full gecko we cant know she may yet see the faces of her baby twins give up work forever and open an orphanage but for now she has put out a statement that attempts to reassure shareholders and busybody business types that having twins is not going to change her commitment to her company and this is what has annoyed people fair enough its not sisterly or touchyfeely in any way and its not trailblazing for parents rights in the workplace but why should it be why do we have to agree with the personal decisions of every woman on the planet why does a woman ceo have to be a role model supposing you want to be curmudgeonly and irritating and eccentric and antisocial if those things are in your nature you should be allowed to be because a man can be all these things and more and no one would even notice i dont judge mayer for her decision and her childcare is none of our business what if she had a fulltime stayathome partner for example is the decision still wrong but supposing you do judge her and think what shes doing is wrong both as a parent and as an employer so what let women be ambitious tough corporate cruel nasty and wrong sometimes because these traits are human and men are allowed to be all of these things without any comment being passed until we let women make autonomous decisions about their lives without expecting them to represent constantly we will never have equality there are thousands of different styles of leadership for men there is only one for women behave in such a way that others wont be offended by you i dont defend or support mayers statement which is why she is ceo and i am not but i defend and support her decision to do what she wants with her life whether others agree with it or not feminism is not about women doing the right thing as women its about equality and that means having the equal right to be a person others might sometimes see as a total git and i defend any persons right to be

marissa mayer the ceo of yahoo says she plans to return to work two weeks after giving birth to twins this december which depending on your view is either no big deal or the end of the world as we know it her delivery date coincides with what she calls a unique time in yahoos transformation it sounds like itll be a magical christmas you can take exception to mayers statement for having to exist at all regardless of her actual plans that she feels the need to clarify the explicit terms of her leave woman has kids does job is depressing i dont recall say mort zuckerman the publisher of the daily news saying much about his outofoffice plans when his second daughter was born for that matter i dont recall any uproar about zuckerman being at the time which laura wadegery would be justified in feeling quite bitter about the language of mayers statement too had about it the alltoocommon starchy defensive air of someone countering an unspoken accusation that women ceos of childbearing age are more trouble than theyre worth since the pregnancy had been uncomplicated she said she intended to take only limited leave and to work throughout if youre only taking two weeks off adding that youll be working throughout looks less like dedication than fear for ones job thatcher gave off the same vibe when she went on about hating the feminists and of course from a feminist perspective this move of mayers is unhelpful because it undermines the campaign to improve statutory maternity leave in the us which has worse maternity benefits than any other developed nation by indicating that two weeks is ample time for postpartum women to get back on their feet and then behind a desk even after an uncomplicated pregnancy a lot of women need more time than that for their body fully to recover particularly if theyre nursing the counterargument that many american men get little or no paid paternity leave only five states offer men and women paid parental leave on an equal basis fails to account for the fact that fathers bodies havent just been put through a meat grinder i have some sympathy for mayer shes not a politician its not her job to be anything but a ceo she didnt sign up to be a role model and while the law in the us should be strengthened to guarantee paid parental leave there is also an awful lot of puritanical nonsense around when its considered decent for mothers to return to work in england women are expected to fall into a vegetative state for an entire year after having a child in the us most women are working again and productive inside of three months there is something to be said for the expectation that you can and will function as an intellectual being in the immediate aftermath of having a baby the extra factor in this story is that mayer is expecting twins which leads to the assumption that she will be in an evenmorestrungout state than after the successful conclusion of a single pregnancy oddly having twins may in some way make it easier for her to return to work quickly if the birth is uneventful most twin mothers dont exclusively breastfeed their children either because they cant produce enough milk to sustain two babies or because their babies were small and needed a formula supplement from the start as a result twin babies get used to being bottle fed from other people early on in their lives leaving their mothers at least a little room to rest in those sleepless early days and leaving your children with professional caregivers when they are that young is potentially less disruptive than it looks at two weeks old most babies are too young to register the absence of their mothers unlike a six month old who will go berserk when its mother steps away for even a minute assuming all goes well theres no practical reason why mayer cant go back to work as with so much of the terrain around motherhood her decision is being judged on moral grounds leaving two newborns to overhaul yahoo mail thats the rub may not strike one as particularly helpful to women but judging mayer solely on the basis of how she handles her maternity leave is by far the greater crime against feminism,2015-09,marissa mayer ceo yahoo

its been over a year since gamergate brought online misogyny to the forefront of the national conversation on women and gaming and while mainstream circles have moved on to the next controversy and news story women online and in the gaming industry have continued their work and continued dealing with a regular influx of abuse and threats but when i asked anita sarkeesian the feminist frequency executive director whose events have been threatened with a mass shooting and a bomb scare about the way that gamergate seems to have faded a bit from public discourse she noted that just because the media isnt talking about it doesnt mean online harassment is slowing down gamergate reminded people that theyre still active this week even though theyve been widely discredited on monday the popular tech conference sxsw interactive announced that they were canceling a panel on gaming and harassment unrelated to gamergate as well as a panel made up of gamergate participants because of online threats against the conference essentially organizers determined that there wouldnt be a conversation about harassment because of harassment after the backlash organizers reportedly offered to reinstate at least the antiharassment panel the original panelists had as of tuesday night not decided whether to still appear by initially canceling the events sxsw interactive director hugh forrest sent a rather limp message which chris kluwe essentially called an act of cowardice to those sending threats that abusive tactics work and that there was no need to maintain the civil and respectful dialogue that he believes defines his conference by making event organizers fearful for their safety and the safety of attendees online abusers can at least at first achieve their goal of shutting women up even when the women wont acquiesce on their own for some feminists the major problem with sxsws original response is not just the canceled talks but that organizers framed the issue as a debate as if threats of violence and ongoing harassment were a simple disagreement in which both sides were throwing rhetorical punches brianna wu head of development at game company giant spacekat and a frequent target of online threats told me when you have women being criminally harassed and threatened on one side the people doing the harassment on the other and men sitting in the middle feeling they are independent arbiters this is an equation women will lose in every time sarkeesian meanwhile tweeted that sxsws both sides rhetoric is merely the status quo of a tech industry largely ignoring systemic online harassment but its not just feminists who were concerned in response to sxsws decision buzzfeed threatened to pull their participation noting that the women who deal with harassment often do their work despite being threatened and that the conference should find a way to do what those other targets of harassment do every day to carry on important conversations in the face of harassment vox media followed suit and on tuesday afternoon congresswoman katherine clark of massachusetts sent forrest a letter noting that by canceling the event sxsw has assisted those who wish to silence women by threatening violence sources now tell recode that buzzfeed and vox have been invited to contribute to an allday event on harassment that sxsw is contemplating adding as a result of the controversy part of the reason panels at places like sxsw are so important is that they put womens stories and experiences out there again and again to try to change not only the harassment but the climate that allows it to flourish we need to challenge the idea that online harassment isnt real that online hate isnt potent and dangerous sarkeesian said what that change looks like though is still up in the air wu told me that the only way to help the public is to keep talking about it sarkeesian said we need to keep putting pressure on social media and tech companies to rethink their systems and devise solutions that will actively deter harassment meanwhile latoya peterson an editoratlarge at fusion and the creator of the girl gamers video series believes that improving the climate for women and gaming also has to come by looking beyond the threats of harassment and at the reason why women want to be involved in gaming in the first place one of the reasons she started her series she said was that she was tired of the lives of women in games being reduced to a single narrative of harassment ive been gaming for years and its generally been a fun and engaging place gamers are always playing with possibilities reinventing the past and shaping the future she told me perhaps soon we can imagine a future that is a bit brighter for everyone that used

professions in which women are the most feminized or sexualized tend to be those that are undervalued when we take women less seriously for being sexy it becomes easier for others to justify treating them poorly cheerleading is a case in point back when i was in college two of my roommates were something of local celebrities dancers for the area football team in albany new york they signed autographs at tailgate parties passed out drinks at promotional events and posed for souvenir posters in which the dance team sprawled across a conference table dressed in nothing more than mens shirts and loosened ties the tagline lets get down to business despite the office wear however there was nothing traditional about their work arrangement despite practices dancing at games side events and their likeness being sold on posters and photographs my friends werent paid to be on the dance team was an honor in itself they were told they even had to buy their own uniforms this was over a decade ago and for a small team but it seems that expecting cheerleaders to smile and sit pretty as theyre scandalously underpaid is still common across the board and so on monday assemblywomen nily rozic of new york diane savino of new york and lorena gonzalez of california sent a letter to nba commissioner adam silver asking him to disclose the employment status contract details work agreements and benefits of dancers for all nba teams the nba profits from revenue generated by dance teams who represent the franchise on and off the court they write ensuring they have access to the same workplace protections offered to the players coaching staff and stadium worked is in the best interest of the organization the letter comes after a lawsuit last month from a former milwaukee bucks dancer lauren herington who claims she worked for less than on a monday press call herington detailed how she was mandated to work fulltime hours with parttime pay and was also allegedly subject to weighins daily calorie reports and demands to not discuss wages with other dancers rozic and savino introduced legislation this summer that would mandate cheerleaders be treated as employees rather than independent contractors following in the steps of a similar law passed in california its clear that dancers and cheerleaders who not only put in work at games but practices and promotional events are being treated abysmally and probably illegally i hope they stick it to the nba or the nfl or local team management and get the pay that they deserve but i also cant help but wonder about the less discussed feminist issue here why do we still have cheerleaders at all i dont ask the question to disparage the women who obviously work very hard at their jobs theyre athletes and any bring it on fan knows that theres a whole world of competitive cheerleading that goes beyond what happens at games but at the end of the day were still talking about a profession that is largely about women dancing in skimpy outfits for fans titillation and in celebration of mens real work dancers embody what traditional acceptable womanhood is supposed to look like which is cheerful supportive skinny and sexy thats why nothing could have been more disappointing than the ending of amy schumers hit movie trainwreck schumer wins back her boyfriend by throwing on a knicks city dancer outfit and shimmying to prove shes not the dour judgey type but while i continue to find the notion of cheerleading a bit cringeworthy and antiquated its more important to me that women are paid fairly for their hard work but maybe once that happens we can talk about ditching the pompoms,2015-10,profession woman feminized sexualized tend undervalued take woman less seriously sexy becomes easier others justify treating

its a grey saturday morning and the lobby of londons hilton metropole hotel is filled with rugby fans wearing matching all blacks jackets projected on to the wall above their heads is a huge line drawing of three vulvas as am comes and goes theyre surrounded by women and men but mostly women queueing up for their greenandpurple wristbands chatting about sex trafficking and the glass ceiling were here more than of us for the annual feminism in london conference two days of talks speeches and workshops the conference was founded in by the london feminist network and in lisamarie taylor attended for the first time it changed my life she tells me in an email hurriedly written from the back of one of this years panels it made me want to join the womens liberation movement i never dreamed id be running it by midday on saturday im not sure whether my life has changed but ive certainly seen a lot of feminism ive learned about equality and austerity nearly bought a book of photos of womens breasts and heard speeches from sophie walker leader of the womens equality party and shami chakrabarti director of the human rights organisation liberty the conference is full of tshirts on sale are intersectionality i have millicent tendencies and this is what a feminist looks like i spot two women wearing fuck off im a witch the vegetarian buffet hasnt even opened yet postlunch i head to a session for teenagers the sessions aim is to smash the glass ceiling by developing business skills and the teens are briefed to pitch a new company or charity to investors the young women on my table range from to and most came to the conference on their own or with friends though one came because mum wanted to for these young women equality is key lets make sure our recruitment isnt ageist one notes after all gender is a spectrum offers another as they decide on a store selling ethical genderneutral clothes called unisex theyre ambitious and punchy with their ideas but as soon as gill owens the business professor in charge of the session mentions that setting up a shop can be pricey they wilt and start hacking their dreams down to size in fact when three teams come to pitch they all shy away from asking for a specific amount of investment i do this with groups of both genders and its completely different owens tells me if this room were full of guys theyd be asking for hundreds of thousands of pounds right off the bat the range of ages and backgrounds is perhaps the best proof of the conferences success and taylor tells me its aim is to bring more women into the liberation movement cleo a londoner who was an activist in the s and s says she can see the difference the movement is now much more diverse and were discussing different things transgender issues for example it makes me feel hopeful a session on men as feminist allies is heated and nearly turns ugly despite the benign warm presence of our chair alan oneill from the mens development network somewhat less benignly he seats all the men in a corner of the room and opens the floor to questions one audience member puffing on an ecigarette delivers a damning verdict fifty per cent of this planet are walking around completely delusional about their importance youre psychotic the room explodes in giggles then boos the debate is divided between those who think men should be included and encouraged in the movement and those who dont one young woman says i dont really care how you feel about feminism what do the men think about all this one stands up to say that at registration on saturday morning i felt alienated because we were in such a minority but i should feel like that more often afterwards i speak to him his names henry who helps run workshops about gender in schools it was daunting and i felt a little uncomfortable he says of the session ive never been shouted down purely on the grounds of my gender but i loved everything i heard in there even if i didnt agree with it all as oneill tells us this is uncomfortable work the more uncomfortable you feel the better youre doing the conference kicks off again at am on sunday i start with vulvanomics a session on what exactly we should call our bits we all groan as the speaker professor emma rees reveals that the oxford english dictionary defines the clitoris as a kind of inferior penis cunt she argues is too far gone for us to reclaim now her suggested replacement term is v but as one audience member points out you cant call it v vee is the baddie in orange is the new black back to the drawing board next a panel discussion on the abolitionist movement the campaign to criminalise the buyers of sex in order to end prostitution a former sex worker tells the audience that she was up and down about coming to fil much of modern feminism is liberal and antiabolition i was glad to see this event took a strong stance in favour of it that stance is outlined in a position statement on the fil website we are critical of the sex industry by this we do not mean that we disapprove of the women involved in it we are critical of the hypercapitalist and patriarchal industry itself the event hashtag is flooded by sex workers and those who are proprostitution angry that the conference did not include them and their voices the journalist jane fae who was due to speak about free speech at the conference pulled out after complaints were made about her views on prostitution julie bindel and caroline criadoperez also pulled out as a result in a session on sexist language we shake our heads over a peta advertisement where pamela andersons body is marked leg breast ribs rump above the caption all animals have the same parts one attendee reveals that she once volunteered to lie on a plate naked slathered in barbeque sauce for a peta campaign i dont think it was sexist and i was happy to do it we look at anderson in a new light as sunday draws to a close i notice a restlessness among my fellow feminists its hard to escape the fact that all the panel discussions and powerpoint presentations in the world wont change society as long as the debate stays within the offwhite walls of the hilton conference centre events like this are great but we can talk all we like at conferences says frances scott founder of the parliament campaign until you actually get power youre just pissing into the wind really as i join the stream of feminists spilling out onto the edgware road i think about a story shami chakrabarti told at the start of the conference once after she delivered a long haranguing speech on human rights abuses a woman took her aside and said that shed learned a lot from the speech but martin luther king never said i have a nightmare after that chakrabarti says i stopped complaining so much i started to talk about what we can actually do,2015-10,grey saturday morning lobby london hilton metropole hotel filled rugby fan wearing matching black jacket projected

feminism is dead long live feminism the front page of the spectator and a spate of other articles would have us believe the battle is won and we can now move on i cant be the only one who thinks this is wonderful news we highly strung handwringing oversensitive perpetually offended wilting violets can hang up our suffragettecoloured hats stop combing twitter in desperate search of minor criticism to weep about and finally stop hating all the men for long enough to get boyfriends rejoice except there are still just a few minor issues to sort out as kind as it is of the spectator that great bastion of equality which recently brought us a blow by blow comparison of the looks of the female labour leadership contenders to let us poor weary feminists off the hook theres a bit of a catch women are still being murdered by their male partners every week of us are still being raped each year and sexually assaulted while of us lose our jobs each year because of maternity discrimination british women earn about less than men overall there are fewer of us running ftse companies than there are men named john we are the majority of lowpaid workers and the domestic and caring work we do is unpaid and undervalued at school one third of us will suffer unwanted sexual touching also known as sexual assault between the ages of and one in four of us will experience domestic violence but you already know all that youve heard it all before the spectator and others are terribly thoughtful to offer us a break because it is a bit tiring really to repeat these statistics over and over again its difficult to keep banging on about a problem that remains unsolved while a vocal section of the population sticks its fingers in its ears and sings nah nah nah nah naaaah i cant hear you there is a bit of a glitch in their plan though because angrily denying that a problem even exists tends to be one of the clearest indicators that a society has yet to get to grips with it so what is the source of this growing angst about feminism if the movement truly were fading to an obscure death as so many commentators suggest you might think that frontpage articles declaring its proponents feminazis and trumpeting its demise would hardly be necessary the real clue is to be found in the articles themselves which fixate on objections to wolf whistles and urge us to get a grip and admit that the real reason for the underrepresentation of women in politics is womens own gooey fixation with babies dont worry therell be an emergency feminist meeting where we can get together and work out what to do now the secret ovaryaching truth has been revealed both arguments suggest a stricken defensive desire to deflect any sense of blame from the majority of men if we maintain that there might be some connection between the treatment of womens bodies as public property in the street and the fact that they are discriminated against in the workplace were suddenly suggesting wolfwhistlers might have to reconsider their behaviour if we foist the burden for discrimination on womens own uncontrollable hormones theres no longer any public responsibility to do anything about the problem because its perfectly natural some are also keen to remind us that we once had a female prime minister and the queen is a woman so what on earth can we still have to make a fuss about and theres a feverish desperation to portray modern feminism as obsessed with body hair and lipstick issues that werent exactly top of the agenda when sisters uncut staged their protest at the suffragette premiere objecting to deep cuts to vital domestic violence services whats really happening here is an increasing anxiety among those in positions of power about the growing impact of feminism so there is a defensive attempt to undercut it by painting feminists as wailing whingers crying about nothing or humourless harpies attacking innocent men so we saw the sir tim hunt case which resulted in ucl taking the independent decision to discontinue his relationship with the university as an ambassador portrayed as the brutal destruction of a noble misunderstood man by an influential furious online mob all this falls down a bit if you stop to take a quick look at the actual online feminist response which focused largely on a humorous and positive campaign by female scientists to raise awareness of their diverse work there remains a deep and insidious belief that by advocating for women we must somehow be trying to take something away from men and it is that fear that is funnelled into antifeminist front pages but feminism has so much to offer everybody regardless of gender those who are concerned about problems disproportionately affecting men such as the high male suicide rate are not diametrically opposed to feminism but actually on the same side we all want to see an end to the outdated gender stereotypes that tell us boys are tough and dont talk about emotions while women are weak and weepy the men who claim they are given an unfair hearing in custody disputes are actually objecting to the same stereotypical notions about gender roles that see women routinely sidelined and even sacked because they are considered a maternity risk harnessing the potential of the whole of society instead of just half will have beneficial outcomes for everybody this isnt about men against women its about people against prejudice so i hope youll forgive me if i decide on reflection to forgo the first part and just stick with the second long live feminism,2015-10,feminism dead

barbara ellen observer columnist an isle of wight father jon platt has overturned a court fine for his daughters unauthorised absence from school on a family holiday successfully arguing that this did not represent a failure to attend school regularly its also reported that even though authorised absences have dropped since the introduction of stricter rules in england in theres been a rise in unauthorised absences and parent fines is it appropriate to quasicriminalise parents for briefly taking their own children out of school schools used to have more leeway to grant leave and widespread anarchy failed to ensue now the system seems to be about control for the sake of it and its little wonder that some parents are rebelling against such authoritarian interference everyone knows about the appalling price hikes during official school holidays with poorer families suffering most then there are the wider holistic benefits of termtime breaks shouldnt education be about enlightening and enriching children in the broadest possible sense far beyond the classroom walls julian baggini writer and philosopher if the question is whether we should quasicriminalise parents then we are in total agreement that the answer is no id concede even more there are times when it is entirely appropriate for parents to take their children out of school during term time to come up with strict rules to determine when this is ok would be impossible so headteachers need their discretion restored however it also seems obvious to me that parents have become too keen and too willing to remove kids in term time when it should only be done in extraordinary circumstances chaos didnt use to ensue for sure but that was in part because the vast majority of parents accepted the restrictions that go with having kids in school not any more something has changed and that appears to be an increased desire to choose what is best for ourselves with scant regard for what is best for the wider community as a whole and this seems equally true of too many leftleaning middle class parents who join the chorus decrying selfish individualism and advocating collective solidarity even while taking off on their midterm holiday such leaves of absence should be the rare exception not the rule are we still in agreement be absolutely of course selfregarding parents cant just grab the kids and zoom off whenever the mood takes them and without a thought for the school syllabus however while there are always going to be overentitled nitwits who push it too far i think that most people would be effortlessly selfregulating in my opinion the former system worked fine it was neither too restrictive nor too lenient we once asked for a solitary friday off for an important occasion and by the end it felt as though we were practically signing our souls away for the privilege with quills dipped in sacrificial chicken blood joking apart the old system trundled along just fine so why change it this isnt about being able to afford disney holidays though theres nowt wrong with that for me this is about cooperating fully with your school while retaining a modicum of parental agency to occasionally turbocharge your own childs hinterland beyond what the department for education deems is inspiring valuable or necessary jb so you think we are in the grip of a moral panic there is no trend for parents to take more termtime holidays and there is nothing to worry about id like to settle that issue by pointing to some good hard data on longterm trends in elective absenteeism but it seems there are no reliable statistics to clinch the case either way if you can prove that we are crying wolf you will see me immediately and embarrassingly conducting a complete uturn whatever the numbers say however there is a question of what we ought to be emphasising the responsibility of parents to keep their children in school as much as possible or their right to take them out when they please in this rhetorical battle i do think that the individual liberty argument is given too much weight and the plea for social responsibility argument too quickly dismissed as nannyism think for instance of the teachers who have to take time to set work for the students to do while away and then mark it avoiding peak times for breaks might be good for those fabled ordinary hardworking families but its one more complication for their extraordinary hardworking teachers be i agree about not sabotaging already beleaguered teachers and the danger of polarising viewpoints one bit of data i keep seeing that supports your side argues that just one week off school damages gcse results which seems somewhat alarmist obviously its the parents responsibility to ensure that their children attend school not just regularly but all the time that said couldnt elective truancy for the truly unmissable also be beneficial i was toying with the idea of a different set of parents every year officially being given the opportunity for termtime time out until every child has done it by the end of their school career it would serve as a kind of kids sabbatical if you like with the children being encouraged to explain to their classmates what theyd been up to with an assembly on their return but maybe thats slipping too deeply into a hippy reverie not to mention presenting a logistical nightmare for teaching staff im not asking for parents to have all the power and do exactly as they please im saying that in my opinion the former perhaps stricter than some recall system generally worked fine and it was a mistake to change it it seemed to turn a quietly manageable situation into a playground wild west jb the value of outofschool learning is real but often a convenient alibi for selfishness i remember one family who took their child out of school for a trip to africa that would indeed have been a richer experience than a week in class but they only did it in term time to suit themselves and save a bit of cash they could have afforded i suspect this kind of middleclass manipulation of the system is much more common than genuine cases of hardpressed families who cannot afford holidays when schools out theres another important lesson children should learn though we cant always do what suits ourselves and expect others to work around us but youre right to think we ought to look for more imaginative solutions than the ridiculous expansion of fines id favour each school choosing a different week each term in which everything is extracurricular and allowing termtime holidays then that would mean that those left behind would also have a different kind of enrichment to the grind of the exams factory i hope thats hippy enough for you,2015-10,barbara ellen

rejoice rejoice feminism is dead and like me i expect youre wondering what to do with all the time saved its terrific news clearly and not just for the poor men shown being oppressed by a scary suffragette on the front cover of this weeks spectator the latest in a growing line to proclaim that the war is over and you ladies can relax freed from worrying about pay gaps and fgm no longer forced to consider whether austerity or shaving your legs or rihanna is a feminist issue not to mention having the housework halved now gender stereotyping has been eliminated overnight women must have gained literally hours in the day how sad that some people just dont get it ploughing on with their inexplicably popular new films about suffragettes and new political parties dedicated to gender equality cant they see weve become such an irreversibly progressive nation that even the clocks will probably refuse to go backwards this weekend sarcasm aside however something about the launch of the womens equality party bothers me but it bothers me not because feminism is dead but because it isnt i want to like the wep i really do i like women i like equality im all for compulsory sex education in schools cancelling the marriage tax break and cheaper childcare while doubting that anhour nursery places even for wealthy professionals are a better use of scarce resources than doing something big for women hit by child taxcredit cuts i know two of the weps three founders a bit and theyre smart people and theyve certainly spotted a juicy demographic there for the taking broadly progressive female voters who dont want to waste a vote other women died for but are profoundly depressed by whats on offer what has happened to soggy centrists of a liberal persuasion this year is rather like what happens to women in later middle age the slow dawning realisation that nobodys chatting you up any more you used to get chased round bars by men trying to get a phone number now if someone taps you on the arm its to point out that you dropped something having been considered hot stuff for two decades ardently pursued by tony and david and nick the phone has similarly stopped ringing for female swing voters jeremy corbyn just isnt that into us michelle dorrell the kent beautician who broke down in tears on last weeks question time over her tax credits has made david cameron look somewhat all mouth and trousers the liberal democrats are rumoured still to exist but confirmed sightings are rare many women want more which must be why thousands have joined the wep but is a new party really the answer this week i interviewed the labour mp naz shah who survived a forced marriage and domestic abuse to defeat george galloway at the polls i heard the new tory mp heidi allens maiden speech attacking the chancellor over tax credits yes i know she voted for them the argument about whether its better to go down in a blaze of rebel glory that changes nothing or try to do deals behind closed doors is one for another column and i watched the videos yvette cooper posted from lesbos where shes investigating the refugee crisis none was revolutionary but all three made me feel quite cheerful about how far weve come since when the new labour women were dismissed either as robotic stepford wives or basically unserious and the few tory women looked on enviously because their own party wouldnt countenance measures to boost their numbers there are still too few female mps and a million things to change but watching those three did not make me think that strong female candidates would be better off heroically losing their deposits for a new party than becoming mps for old ones and using that platform to shake things up if anything it was a reminder that being corralled into safe spaces outside the rough and tumble of the mainstream where stuff actually gets decided is dangerous for women and that the progressive feminist vote probably doesnt need to be split any more than it is the wep models itself on ukip as a movement seeking to nudge other parties towards its position rather than run a country its an intriguing idea but there are two ways in which theyre not ukip first ukips raison detre is saying things other politicians wont usually for good reason say it occupied a perfect gap in the market for eu withdrawal something popular with a vocal minority but not advocated by any mainstream party and mostly championed within those parties by people dismissed as eccentrics the weps cause is one mainstream parties fall over themselves to advocate even if they sometimes screw up in practice and is already championed inside those parties by a critical mass of credible people and outside by credible pressure groups and second ukip was happy to succeed by hurting the party closest to it it couldnt take tory seats in but by splitting the rightwing vote it sometimes let labour do so that helped force the conservatives to take it seriously but also helped repeatedly keep candidates from the party most likely to hold an eu referendum out of power if the wep did snaffle thousands of votes say in big city seats with lots of vaguely liberalminded professional women it would probably take them from labour and the lib dems which might serve them right but if the result was a greater likelihood of conservative government would its supporters feel entirely confident that this had helped the cause if the party goes nowhere fast on the other hand perhaps because it turns out equality matters hugely to women but not as much at a general election as the economy or the nhs or a realistic chance of changing governments then its a gift to the see told you nobody cares any more brigade because popular movements for social change arent destroyed by opposition look at corbynistas who only draw more energy from feeling that big business or murdoch or the rest of the labour party is out to get them its apathy thats the killer that and a tendency to splinter just as theyre finally getting somewhere,2015-10,rejoice rejoice feminism dead like expect youre wondering time saved terrific news clearly poor men shown

one in four women has experienced violence at the hands of an intimate partner the most comprehensive national study of interpersonal family violence carried out to date has found the findings are being released by australias national research organisation for womens safety on thursday the result of a new and comprehensive analysis of existing data from respondents to the australian bureau of statistics personal safety survey the australian bureau of statistics had previously published data that found one in six women had experienced violence from a partner but this was based on women who lived with their partner only said a lead author of the report dr peta cox but when we added in the data on boyfriends girlfriends and date relationships we saw a really big shift in the estimate this more inclusive statistic is really valuable to know because we know violence isnt just happening in cohabiting relationships while men had experienced violence by a female intimate partner close to million women reported violence perpetrated by a male intimate partner the nationally representative data revealed just looking at cohabiting relationships that is people living with a current or former partner one in six women experienced intimate partner violence compared with one in men gender remained the most substantial variable when considering differences in patterns of victimisation and perpetration the report found in comparison with men women were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual violence whether a sexual assault or sexual threat of women who had been sexually assaulted four out of went to see a doctor after their most recent assault and women suffered a miscarriage as an injury from their most recent sexual assault since the age of million women had experienced sexual violence compared with men the analysis found the difference in rates of sexual violence for men and women was statistically significant and therefore was not a result of chance men were more likely to be victims of physical violence which was experienced by one in two men and one in three women the study found and both women and men were more than three times as likely to be physically assaulted by a man than by a woman both women and men were more likely to suffer fractured or broken bonesteeth when their assailant was male than when they were assaulted by a female perpetrator the report found the comprehensive study also examines time taken off work victims experiences through the court system and the the presence of alcohol and other drugs in cases of violence

on tuesday the womens equality party wep will announce its ideas for how equal pay equal representation and equal parenting can be achieved next year it hopes to field candidates in elections the party led by journalist sophie walker was founded three months ago and now has members we have been asking people to tell us why they joined here are some of their responses for some reason feminism has become a dirty word i hope the party can restore a sense that womens issues are important and relevant to everyone when i left my allgirls school in the late s i had been educated to believe i could do anything i wanted to do and that i was equal to men it was a cruel disappointment when i went to work in the city and gradually realised that life was far from fair or equal now as the mother of two daughters i feel outraged that britain has not moved closer to equality and that on far too many womens issues most of the population women included do not even seem to realise there is a problem i hope the party can raise awareness of issues such as the pay gap and point to the other countries that are doing better than us where it does not seem to be inevitable because women are the ones that bear children i hope the party can force some of these issues on to the political agenda so that the mainstream parties realise that adopting them will win them votes for some reason feminism has become a dirty word i hope the party can restore a sense that womens issues are important and relevant to everyone jane turner business owner bath i would like a more just society irrespective of gender i was a member of the labour party until very recently i became disillusioned with labour during the process for electing the new leader and i cannot honestly support jeremy corbyn after the contest i was particularly annoyed that they gave women junior posts and in particular i felt they should have given shadow treasury to angela eagle so i decided to look elsewhere and remembered sandi toksvig setting up a new party i googled and joined i would like a more just society irrespective of gender pat gibson works in education i believe that policies that promote gender equality will give society a greater respect for women which i hope will help end violence against women and girls its taken me until my late s to recognise the huge problems caused by gender inequality both on an individual and a societal level and now ive opened my eyes i see it everywhere as i approach the years when people generally begin settling down and having children im suddenly very aware of how differently men and women get treated and the huge impact this has on womens lives its not right and i dont want my future to be impeded just because im a woman while the men around me exceed in all aspects of public life when i heard about the womens equality party i got in touch with them immediately it was a nobrainer i dont see any other political parties making gender equality a priority or even recognising theres an issue and progress has been painfully slow i think the only way to speed things along is to start taking votes away from the main parties and building a voice that cant be ignored women are massively underrepresented in parliament so i hope the womens equality party can act as a constant reminder that we do exist and we need to be listened to i want to see women equally represented across all aspects of public life from politics to the media to the workplace and for the pay gap to be well and truly obliterated i believe that policies that promote gender equality will give society a greater respect for women which i hope will help end violence against women and girls alexandra windgate media manager edinburgh the party really is a broad church not a different option to the labour party but something that is completely different when i understood how the womens equality party would operate not as a pressure group but as a political movement focused on the most important areas of inequality and on taking action around issues that will have the biggest effect in creating equality i was in my experience has not disappointed and the party really is a broad church not as some people hopedfeared a different option to the labour party but something that is completely different new and keen to make a new kind of politics that is completely free from the baggage of an old party of any persuasion trying to reinvent itself i hope and believe that the womens equality party is not envious of power does not desire to take over the world but would see a job done as parity in political representation parity in pay parity in parenting and also better education for all sexes that addressed gender bias in both what is taught in schools and also how it is taught it would also have addressed the way in which the media represent women and worked with both men and women to reduce violence and harm if this can be achieved by other parties moving these up their agendas and making these their priorities then there would be no need for us to have a majority and form a government which lets be honest might take a while but if they dont then maybe well have to get a few more mps elected for the womens equality party and do the work ourselves deborah mason artist london i see female victims of violence children growing in homes where its not good enough and where theres something we as a country can do about it i am a social worker in the city i love i see the privileged and the disempowered on a daily basis and feel lucky to have the choices and relationships i do i know that this isnt everybodys journey i see female victims of violence children growing in homes where its not good enough and where theres something we as a country can do about it i am so fed up of the them and us rhetoric that fills parliament i want to hear the we rhetoric where everyone benefits from everyones success not just a tiny population of people who find themselves born into privilege and expectation rosie social worker sheffield i joined because i am tired of having to repeat myself to be heard while male colleagues or friends are listened to straightaway i joined because i am tired of having to repeat myself to be heard while my male colleagues or friends are listened to straightaway i am tired of seeing women portrayed as one or twodimensional characters in the media vilified for how they dress and attacked when they speak out it is not acceptable any more i am tired and wep is the only party where i feel my voice is being heard and whhich is standing for things that are important to me in the short term i hope the party can manage to get its message across and attract supporters that represent the population of the uk by that i mean women and men of all backgrounds and abilities in the longer term i hope that the party manages to create a movement that draws the attention of the mainstream parties and makes them change the way they prioritise equality and particularly womens equality carrie lynch scientist walthamstow an unequal society has a detrimental effect on all not just those who are held back i joined the wep so that my four daughters can hopefully grow up in a more equal britain an unequal society has a detrimental effect on all not just those who are held back in years of teaching in comprehensive schools many of my most brilliant students were and are female why then is it harder for them to become mps judges or even headteachers i want the wep to raise the profile of equality issues to agitate and press for more equal parliamentary representation in the long run to help form a society where everyone is simply judged on what they do not who they are matthew stokes teacher we do most of the real work of looking after each other and are not as interested in gain so end up with less i would like a uk that is more thoughtful and focused on releasing the potential of all its citizens and a political system where womens voices are not silenced women are still struggling with sexism and unequal pay and domestic violence and rape and a world formed by men to their own advantage we do most of the real work of looking after each other and are not as interested in gain so end up with less im a lesbian and although intensely interested in the world of politics as an observer have never been moved to join anything before hearing sandi toksvig talking such sense nisha jani therapist the pace of change is just too slow and its time to push this issue to the very front of the national agenda ive been a feminist since i was and read the female eunuch some things have changed for the better in that years but not nearly enough and not nearly fast enough women still earn so much less than men over their careers and are at much greater risk of poverty in old age there are still bare breasts on display in a national newspaper only a third of the cabinet are women a grotesque percentage of female undergraduates experience sexual assault at university the pace of change is just too slow and its time to push this issue to the very front of the national agenda then we can help the rest of the world do the same ive just heard the prime minister mention gender inequality in pay in his conference speech the issue is rising up the political agenda and wep is going to dropkick it to the top i also believe that wep is going to improve conditions for vulnerable women on low incomes which includes the carer class on no income i believe it will tackle the issues which see young women falling behind in educational achievement after the age of despite the fact they lead up to that point i also believe wep will steer policy into doing much for women in abusive relationships and at risk of violence and exploitation from unacceptable cultural beliefs the people of all genders who have founded and joined wep are creating a new way of doing politics in this country and its going to change it forever maggie alderson writer hastings,2015-10,tuesday womens equality party wep announce idea equal pay equal representation equal parenting achieved next

gender plays an important role in who is most affected by climate change and who is most likely to contribute to it women are times more likely to be killed as a result of extreme weather and can continue to be impacted postdisaster by problems like increased domestic violence at the same time environmentallyfriendly practices such as carrying reusable bags becoming vegetarian and driving smaller cars are seen as feminine and therefore undesirable for men who can have higher carbon emissions consider vegetarianism according to one study done in vancouver a relatively vegetarianfriendly city in north america manhood is still considered a precarious state easily lost and requiring constant validation through purposefully abstaining from meat a widely established symbol of power status and masculinity it seems that the vegetarian man is perceived as more principled but less manly than his omnivorous counterpart however such connections between masculinity and environmentallyfriendly behaviors go beyond choices about food in an account of a man who bought a prius he had some adjustment problems he missed looking down on other drivers from the lofty perch of his sport trac and he grimaced when his friends asked whether he was carrying a purse lets face it he sighed the prius isnt the most masculine vehicle on the planet recently while reading about plastic bag legislation i found that even carrying reusable bags could be seen as something that women do and therefore considered humiliating im embarrassed to bring my own tote bag he said adding that it is mostly women who do it in addition to potentially creating a gap in environmental action between genders these can also provide ammunition for men to use on other men a sikh man who was recently attacked was first subject to obscenities and racial slurs including bin laden terrorist go back to your country and why are you driving that small prius ive got a big suv why do these stereotypes matter when it comes to reducing carbon emissions even in nations known for their gender equality there are differences in energy use by men and women largely due to behavior for example in sweden which ranks fourth in the global gender gap index single men used about more energy than women in all age groups mostly due to their higher energy consumption for transport which was more than the amount of energy women used this difference was largely attributed to differences in car use employed women tend to make shorter work trips are more inclined to use public transport and make more trips to serve another persons travel needs while they also drive far fewer miles per year than men while there were certain consumption categories in which women generally used more energy than men the overall energy use among men was still higher stereotypes of environmentally friendly actions as more effeminate and therefore undesirable could have implications for climate action there are efforts underway to address the connection between gender equality and climate change at the cop climate negotiations in paris and at the same time we need to also explore ways to eliminate this cultural barrier to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while some suggest changing the marketing of lower impact products to be more appealing to men a few vegan men are taking it into their own hands to redefine masculinity itself to be about protecting the planet not dominating it it should be noted that although there are more female vegetarians there are more male vegans its suggested that this is because theres something hard core about veganism showing that the reality of whos actually living a certain way is more complex than stereotypes indicate but we need to go even further than imprinting veggie burgers with grill marks or replacing meat with virtue as a marker of masculinity and examine why something thats considered effeminate is automatically undesirable as other feminists have pointed out its often assumed that masculine behavior is the default that everyone should aspire to women are often told to speak and act more like men in order to be successful replacing one definition of masculinity with another lower impact one is a step but we also need to examine the roots of these stereotypes and start rethinking the perception of feminine as automatically undesirable to ensure

for anyone with even a passing interest in gender equality or womens rights its a relief to see feminism becoming more and more mainstream no longer solely the domain of crotchety academics who demand we take a lighter to our lingerie feminisms makeover for the new millennium has made it as accessible and fun as a beyonc single and its everywhere we look there are feminist boxing classes feminist baking groups and of course feminist dating websites because when we talk about having it all we also want a feminist boyfriend right in theory it sounds excellent it would be a hard slog to have a relationship with someone whose sociopolitical stance differs hugely from yours so when i first began identifying as a feminist i thought that my beliefs would carry over seamlessly in to my dating life as well im a feminist so shouldnt the men i date and sleep with be feminists too unfortunately it wasnt quite so simple from the man who opened a text conversation with a photo of his naked chest and encouraged me to reciprocate in the name of the free the nipple movement to the fellow who agonised over accepting a blowjob because despite enjoying them he found the act simply too degrading to let me perform dating male feminists turned out to be one of the least empowering decisions ive ever made its not that i dont want to be with a man who respects me values consent or is conscious of the various genderbased imbalances in the world today these qualities are a bare minimum but men looking for feministsanctioned romance tend to fall in to one of two categories those who use our attraction as a sign of approval and seek out trophy feminists to clear their conscience of any inherent patriarchal wrongdoing and outright predators who employ a barebones knowledge of feminist discourse to target any young woman whose politics so much as graze the notion of sexpositivity the commercialisation of feminist dating whether at a social event or on an app or website only entrenches these attitudes further it laserfocuses the male gaze on an environment where men can hamfistedly wield their limited knowledge of womens empowerment to look for sex partners and girlfriends in a movement that demands women be seen as everything but for every male feminist horror story i have lived ive been told a dozen more by equallyfrustrated female friends there was the chap who invited me to an event not so much as a plus one but as a testing ground for his ribald sexist oneliners after each remark he would look to me gauging my reaction to see exactly how much of his cheap and dirty humour he could unleash while still passing the feminist litmus test i had lunch with a man whose openness about sex and sexuality impressed me until i declined his offer for an afternoon quickie his response made it clear that his feminism had no room for my apparent frigidity then there was the gentleman who messaged me every second day to ask my fempinion on everything from vajazzling to lena dunhams memoir when i finally asked him to cool his jets he responded furiously that i should be grateful for his incessant questions and i was lucky a man wanted to hear my opinion at all its not that i dont think men can be feminists there are several men in my life who have approached feminism with respect and considerate thought who have used feminism to examine their own privilege and experiences within the world and have become better people for it but these men are in a disappointing minority compared to the rest of the male feminists i and many other women have encountered men who use the term feminist as either bait or an alterego assuming that their optin respect for women will entitle them to legions of adoring lovers really the most antifeminist act of all when it comes to dating and relating i dont care who opens the door for whom or who picks up the bill i simply want to be in a relationship where my politics arent sexualised where i can look at my partner and see more than a hey girl meme come to life and know that they in turn see me as a threedimensional being a feminist yes but not one who will perform on command feminism has enlightened and empowered me and now im using that power to put my foot down and say no more to the movements male members bell hooks is nobodys wingwoman and while it may be correct to say notallmalefeminists i

the premier of queensland has been warned not to recognise male victims of domestic violence at the expense of women after she said she had changed her language to include male victims annastacia palaszczuk who has committed to ending domestic violence told a community cabinet event violence against men is something that needs to be addressed more i do understand that there are a number of men have gone through or are going through domestic violence she said on sunday according to fairfax media i actually did change my language when it did become public because it was brought to my attention that there was some serious issues surrounding some men in our community needing help as well i do think that is something we do need to address a bit more palaszczuk was responding to a question from a man who said he had been the victim of domestic violence karyn walsh the ceo of micah projects which runs the brisbane domestic violence service said there was no problem in acknowledging male victims of violence as long as the issue of domestic violence was approached as a gendered one its important to acknowledge any human being that experiences violence but we need to make sure our response to domestic violence maintains a gendered focus she said we have to be allowed to talk about that this is a gendered issue and acknowledge that men may be victims but not lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming issue is the attitude men have to women as their possessions as something they can control and punish it is about their attitude walsh said it was important the issue was approached as a gendered one so resources and programs could be properly allocated the severity and extent and volume of women experiencing violence needs to always be maintained as fact no problem acknowledging that men may be victims but in overall scheme of things it is women who are impacted walsh said in many cases of violence against men in a relationship by a woman the woman was acting in self defence walsh said she was confident after the report into domestic violence by quentin bryce palaszczuk would not be recognising male victims at the expense of women moo baulch ceo of

men i can kind of understand where shes coming from in lgbtqi relationships gay men experience domestic violence at really similar rates she said i think theres a really strong mens rights lobby in this area and i certainly know we get substantial attacks through media and social media theres a really strong lobby that would like us to believe women and men experience domestic violence at equal rates and we just know that thats not true baulch said there was a resistance to recognising the gendered nature of domestic violence as it becomes less taboo to talk about it challenges peoples

parents should be denied child benefit if they do not send their children to preschool education from the age of three according to an increasingly influential conservative pressure group the penalty should apply to a parent in the case of a child aged two if the toddler comes from a disadvantaged background the new counterpoverty strategy suggests the proposed loss of child benefit is set out in a pamphlet by bright blue a liberal conservative pressure group and thinktank and is designed to ensure disadvantaged children receive preschool education to make them ready for school bright blue says it is essential to seek new ways to persuade parents to send their children to preschool education it argues that just as the government is planning to withdraw child benefit from parents of truanting children so the same disincentives should apply to parents that do not take up the opportunity of free preschool education ministers have said they are doubling the amount of free preschool childcare or education to hours a week the proposal is bound to be attacked by labour as another assault on the poor and comes in the wake of controversy over the loss of tax credits a survey last year by a childrens charity found that many sure start centre face closure because of budget cuts with m less being spent on them in the three years from ministers want to expand the range of targets for ending child poverty to include the readiness for school of poorer children the work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith in the welfare bill is replacing the incomebased target for child poverty with two new targets the first is based on the number of disadvantaged children being raised in workless households and the second is the educational attainment of disadvantaged children aged compared with other children in his speech to the tory party conference in manchester david cameron promised an allout war on poverty but said it would no longer be driven by small cash transfers by the state to poorer families but instead by tackling what the party manifesto referred to as the root causes of poverty entrenched worklessness family breakdown problem debt and drug and alcohol dependency but conservative policymakers acknowledge that since worklessness is in sharp decline and many life opportunities are settled very early in a childs life the government should be looking at an additional antipoverty target covering a childs readiness for school at the age of five ministers may yet table amendments to the welfare bill currently in the commons to incorporate schoolreadiness targets bright blues director ryan shorthouse insists the measure should not be seen as punitive or designed to be critical of stayathome parents but should instead be regarded as a proeducation measure he says the idea draws on new empirical evidence that having diverse social networks in terms of ethnicity and social grade can mitigate poverty the pressure group argues that the evidence for the benefit of preschool care is so strong that formal education should not be compulsory from the age of five but much earlier the report says we need takeup of the early years free entitlement to ensure children and also parents benefit not only from goodquality care but also the diverse networks they are likely to cultivate by attending these institutionsshorthouse said reducing poverty is not just about people having more money important as that is there is now evidence which shows that having strong and diverse relationships is associated with a reduced likelihood of being in poverty universal public services such as childrens centres and nurseries are key institutions where people from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds can forge relationships with one another but the poorest adults and children including those from ethnic minority backgrounds are often the least likely to participate in these institutions the report also calls for all sure start childrens centres to provide registration of births and english classes ofsted inspections of sure start childrens centres nurseries and primary schools should take into account whether the social composition of their governing bodies or advisory boards reflects that of local communities no sure start centre should be given outstanding status if it does not have a diverse governing body it says individual sure start centres should collect standardised sociodemographic data on participating families and receive a financial reward for increasing participation by disadvantaged people from ethnicminority backgrounds and a financial penalty for failing to do so this article was amended on october an earlier version implied bright blue was suggesting receipt of child benefit should be linked to attendance at a sure start centre it was suggesting that the receipt of the benefit should be linked to attendance of preschool education as delivered by the early years free

it was in march that journalist catherine mayer made the comment about women in politics that led to the formation of an accidental political party she asked if anyone fancied joining her in the bar for a chat about starting a new political group and by the time the women of the world festival had finished on londons southbank mayer had comedian sandi toksvig on board as cofounder of the womens equality party wep by june they had a fundraiser by july theyd appointed a leader former reuters journalist sophie walker and opened a membership scheme within just three months britains newest political party has amassed a membership of more than and rising and has branches around the country on tuesday the wep will be exposed to the scrutiny of political pundits with its first policy launch after extensive consultations the party will announce its ideas for how equal pay equal representation and equal parenting can be achieved the headline will be a call for quotas mayer is calling for gender targets in the commons and the lords to tackle a clear disparity next year they hope to field candidates in elections obviously we were working things out as we went but when by july we had all these people on board we realised we had underestimated the support and it was about how much we could scale our ambitions up not down said mayer the weps first call for quotas to bring a balance to parliament is a quick fix measure she said it is a special measure but it will only hold if the other things we will be proposing are also enacted the new party is the latest indication of the deep discontent with mainstream politics and of frustration with the lack of ambition in tackling gender equality across society just a quarter of those standing at the last general election were women and of the mps elected less than a third only are female twothirds of the current cabinet are men and jeremy corbyn gave none of the top jobs in his shadow cabinet to women the wep is resolutely neither leftwing nor rightwing but nonpartisan its one and only aim is as it says on the tin a better deal for women in politics education business jobs pensions childcare and the media it was the only way to do it said mayer and easier for me because although im from a leftwing background ive covered politics for years as a journalist ive never worked on the assumption that politicians are all in it for themselves ive never bought into the idea of the evil selfserving politician that occupies one side or the other because interestingly enough although there are a few people like that i have met many dedicated people on both sides who are in politics for the right reasons no one party has a monopoly on virtue ive just found out that sandi toksvig has been at one time or another a member of the labour party the conservatives and the lib dems so she is wellplaced to have an allround view the wep see themselves as part of the grassroots movements for change that are swelling across the country part of a wider phenomenon which has seen corbyn elected labour leader the rise of ukip and north of the border the emergence of groups such as the women for independence movement which has led to hundreds of communityfocused groups springing up in scotland in the often misogynistic climate that exists online anything with the word women in the title can attract hostility ranging from the snide to the offensive but mayer said the worst abuse has come from radio fans the funniest trolling i have ever had amid the usual boring stuff was a whole load of people utterly furious that id taken sandi toksvig away from the news quiz im afraid the where are the mens party comments tend to induce a bit of a guffaw there are real areas in which men and boys are in hardship young boys are falling behind at school in places and there are high rates of suicide among men for example but the idea that they are a symptom of men being discriminated against is wrong you can clearly see that men are betterrepresented in all areas of life we can throw statistics around for ever but the fact is that the whole system is stacked against women men absolutely do have problems and these problems need to be addressed in very urgent ways id say a happier and fairer society will impact on everyone im very happy with the name all genders are joining us and i hope they continue to more than half the population is living in inequality and that is genuinely not good for everyone economically or culturally but we have no desire to push women at the cost of men one of the key messages is that what we are proposing is not bad for men it makes things better a grand total of women have served as mps in british political history fewer than the current crop of men occupying the commons benches women make up just of judges and of ftse company directors the gender pay gap is still yawning at almost and the average woman will earn less over her working life than a man its not just about women its a straightforward calculation said mayer we are in and nowhere in the world are women equal that is extraordinary and a huge waste of potential,2015-10,wa march

as the national conversation on campus rape grows from white house task forces to magazine covers there are words we hear again and again hysteria panic wrongfully accused the concern espoused by pundits and antifeminists is that renewed actions to end sexual assault are an overreaction that at best will lead to confusion between the sexes and at worst will ruin mens lives in the s when sexual harassment was similarly in the spotlight we heard these same words and worries they are just as wrong now as they were then its been years since vice president biden thenchairman of the senate judiciary committee presided over one of our nations most shameful moments justice clarence thomass confirmation hearings law professor anita hill was harangued by male legislators her accusations of horrific harassment dismissed as biden assured thomas he had the benefit of the doubt still afterwards there were widespread warnings that workplace sexual harassment policies would result in a world where men couldnt tell a woman she was pretty without fear of losing his job in erica jong wrote in the washington post that men terrified of rejection by women they fancy will now have to face courtmartial by the sexual harassment commandoes it will be surprising if any erection ever survives this scrutiny she wrote the manhating dystopia never came not only did erections survive unscathed but sexual harassment continued to flourish today we dont see scores of men fired or denied justice because of innocent compliments or dirty jokes instead perpetrators routinely go unpunished their victims ignored and disparaged renowned astronomer geoffrey marcy for example was found guilty this summer of serially harassing women over the course of almost a decade yet wasnt fired or suspended from his prominent position at uc berkeley instead the school issued a warning against him and marcy offered a tepid apology it was only after faculty outrage and media coverage exploded that marcy finally resigned this week its hard to see marcys departure as a win however considering he enjoyed immense power and prestige in his field for years even though his behavior had long been an open secret one harvard professor who was a graduate student under marcy told buzzfeed anybody of my generation in the field of exoplanets knows that geoff does this and one of the complainants said his harassment was so wellknown that women discouraged other women from working with him decades of work on sexual harassment later and the best women can do to protect themselves it seems is to slyly warn each other away from predatory men blogger cliff pervocracy has aptly called this this missing stair strategy often when theres a predator in a community instead of getting rid of him women give each other a heads up dont fall watch out for that missing stair its easier to steer clear of a harasser than make a complaint against him especially when hes powerful because women know that theyre often disbelieved or ignored in fact while the number of complaints received by the equal opportunity employment commission has gone down significantly since the s the percentage of cases found to have no reasonable cause has only risen so the next time you read a blustery article about how the battles young people are fighting against rape culture are hysterical or that campuses are

victorias former police chief commissioner ken lay says he never felt he was held to account by government for keeping women and children safe during his policing career lay who spent years in the force and retired this year was pivotal in highlighting family violence during his time as chief commissioner but he told victorias royal commission into family violence he was driven to make cultural changes by his predecessor as chief commissioner christine nixon and other senior women within the force rather than by government and politicians i just never felt truly accountable to government about making women and children safe lay said it was more of an intuitive thing driven from within the organisation and some very strong womens voices from within victoria police lay chairs the council of australian governments coag advisory panel on reducing violence against women and children as commissioner lay proposed a strong independent body that would sit above the police and other agencies responding to family violence to hold them to account to me the accountability stuff is so important it drives the agencies to work together he said im deeply attracted to an index that says this is what youll deliver and if youre not delivering it why not the death of yearold luke batty who was killed by his father greg anderson was an example of why such a body was needed lay said the coroner ian gray handed down his findings into lukes death earlier this month and lay said that although gray had done some nice work in picking apart what went wrong the agencies involved needed to be driven to change he spoke of how heartened he was to have seen such a strong change in attitudes towards women among leaders inside and outside the police force it was significant that malcolm turnbulls first policy announcement as prime minister was related to funding for family violence thats two steps forward but a week later we get nonsense down at geelong from the mayor of geelong who makes some statement its just enormously frustrating lay said lay was referring to the geelong mayor darryn lyons who was widely criticised for wearing a tshirt featuring an image of the singer madonna hitchhiking naked while holding a sign with the slogan gas grass or ass nobody rides for free lyons later wrote on twitter that he had no idea the slogan might be seen as offensive so while we can say yes were moving forward we cant lose sight of the fact that many people in our community including people in leadership positions still dont quite get this lay said a second round of public

the leader of the new womens equality party has called for a gender quota system to select mps at the next two elections to achieve equal representation in the house of commons by sophie walker a former reuters journalist is urging her fellow political leaders to sign up to the goal of gender parity in the lower house of parliament within the next decade as she condemned the glacial pace of change in society when it comes to womens equality she announced the proposal ahead of the partys policy launch next week six months after the organisation was founded by the comedian sandi toksvig and journalist catherine mayer the party has spent the last few months in consultation about how to achieve its aims of equality in politics business education pay parenting and the media as well as an end to violence against women it now has members and supporters across branches compared with ukips most recent claim to have more than members and the green partys speaking to the guardian walker said her party had calculated it was possible to reach gender equality among mps by by making sure there are allwomen shortlists in the former seats of at least twothirds of retiring mps the womens equality party also wants to see threequarters of all peerages handed to women in order to have parity in the house of lords by we are going to come out and say that in order to establish an equal system of politics we think the time has come to put parliament into special measures walker said for the next two elections we think we need quotas to bring in representation we can do it in two elections labour has already used allwomen shortlists which has increased the partys ratio of female mps to however the tactic has always been resisted by the conservative party of whose mps are female and the lib dems who no longer have any female mps about of snp mps are women however labour does not escape criticism from walker who said she was disappointed to see the partys top leadership and shadow cabinet jobs go to men under jeremy corbyn labour has made significant progress on taking on allwomen shortlists but whats happened over the last few weeks has shown us there is a problem in the internal structure of the party when all of the partys leaders and mayoral candidates are male she welcomed the message of david camerons conservative party conference speech that he wanted to end discrimination but said time would tell whether it was genuine the response of the other leaders to the womens equality partys proposals is likely to affect where and how it stands candidates at the election she said at the moment however the party is focused on choosing candidates for next years devolved assembly and council elections addressing traditional criticism that quotas could be unfair on male candidates and unmeritocratic walker says which quotas are you referring to are you referring to the quotas we are suggesting here or are you referring the centuriesold unlegislated quotas that have meant men have had an unfair institutional advantage for centuries to me those are quotas its just they are not written down in law that makes them much more invidious walker addressed the argument that quotas allow in mediocre people by saying a system in which you are fishing in a small pool of people who all look and sound alike is more likely to create mediocrity than if you break it open to the huge diversity in our country we have million women in the country i think its highly unlikely you would struggle to find brilliant ones to become mps the party is only proposing gender quotas but wants to support all groups at a disadvantage in their representation in politics business and other spheres of life we want to represent not just people who are disadvantaged because of their gender but people who are doubly or trebly or quadruply disadvantaged by their gender and their race and their socioeconomic background and their age and their disability walker said without quotas the party believes gender parity in the house of commons will not be achieved until and in the house of lords until meanwhile a coalition of civil society groups has published new research showing that there have been just female mps in britains history which is less than the number of male mps currently sitting in the commons the report sex and power by the centre for women amp democracy electoral reform society unlock democracy fawcett society and the hansard society found that women made up just of all candidates at the last election with the greens

gender quotas should be mandatory for senior positions across the private and public sectors in britain to boost the number of women in highpowered positions according to a wideranging study published by the london school of economics and political science lse among its many bold recommendations tuesdays report by the lse commission of gender inequality and power suggests that the burden of the argument should now shift from the underrepresentation of women to the unjustifiable overrepresentation of menamong its key proposals the authors of the study recommend that each political party should adopt quotas to boost the number of female mps and ensure more balanced representation in decisionmaking parliament should pass legislation establishing a maximum limit on the proportion of mps of either sex allowed to stand for general election the study finds beginning with a maximum of of male candidates in each political party in the first general election following the legislation reduced to in the following election this is the most controversial of our recommendations because it involves a mandatory quota on political parties in their selection of candidates for election it is however increasingly the practice across europe including now in ireland and reflects frustration with the history of failed promises and insincere commitments by parties that do not yet regard the homogeneity of their representatives as a serious concern the report states current improvements in gender balance are almost entirely due to those parties that have chosen voluntarily to act on this issue women currently make up of parliament kate green the shadow equalities minister said the report is right radical action is needed to push for greater gender equality and representation labour has led the way as the only political party to have introduced allwomen shortlists in addition to quotas for women standing for local government but with the total number of women to have ever been elected to the house of commons since remaining lower than the number of existing male mps in the current parliament clearly more must be done caroline dinenage minister for women equalities and family justice told the guardian we now have more female mps than ever before and a third of our cabinet is made up of women but there is no room for complacency and we must become more representative of those we serve in order to truly govern as one nation and open up even more opportunities for people to progress regardless of their gender or background the report looked at gender inequality across four key sectors of society the economy politics the legal system and the world of media culture and communications and found that radical change is needed in each area to speed the closing of the gender pay gap among the recommendations in the study the authors called for the creation of a media watchdog on gender to monitor sexism and unequal gender representation in the media evidence gathered in all four areas revealed that the structure of gender relations especially the unequal distribution of responsibility for the care of children and of the elderly creates dilemmas of worklife balance which are detrimental to womens quality of life and to womens life chances across social spheres while there has been some progress on the narrowing of the gender pay gap the report notes that compared with the eu average the uk still has aboveaverage gender pay and pensions gaps the report notes there has been little improvement in the pay gap in higherpaid jobs and suggests that one reason the overall gap has narrowed is because of a decline in male earnings at the bottom the study found that since the economic crisis of the costs of austerity have fallen disproportionately on women especially in bme black and minority ethnic and lowincome families public sector cuts to services traditionally relied on by women childcare centres or refuges for domestic violence victims for example have intensified existing inequalities,2015-10,gender quota mandatory senior position across private public sector britain boost number woman highpowered position

demonstration was a commemoration of the bodies of abused women in the country who received no justice or recognition and symbolised the trampling of womens rights by the government the line of women

riot on the red carpet there was a clear spotlight on domestic violence in the news week albeit shining from two wildly different sources sisters uncut a feminist direct action group brought the suffragette premiere to a standstill in leicester square in central london on wednesday night as dozens of women staged a liein on the red carpet to protest against cuts made to domestic abuse services dead women cant vote was their chant before they were dragged off by security guards although helena bonham carter said the protest was the perfect response to the film lying at the feet of alisters is slightly different to being at the hooves of a galloping horse but thats not something thats lost on the group if you look at the suffragettes they didnt just storm film premieres one member said they threatened to kidnap members of parliament they smashed glasses they threatened to bomb places whether or not sisters uncut are going to take their protests that far remains to be seen but when there are few visible feminist groups in this country taking direct action then leaping over barriers and getting your cause in front of the worlds press is still a coup but suffragette hasnt just inspired public protests its also persuaded screenwriter abi morgan who penned the movie to work only on projects that focus on women for the foreseeable future speaking at the bfi london film festival morgan said she realised that with the little bit of success and power i have i could try to say for the next four or five years im just writing films and tv that focus on women and that is what i am going to do however the writer whos also behind the hour and the iron lady recognised that her influence outside of the uk is limited i can go to the bbc and say ok my next drama is for women and it is diverse women i take that to america however and i have another set of conversations and despite her success it appears that morgan is still not exempt from the widely reported sexism that exists in the film and television industry having previously been dropped from a project because i was told i didnt know how to flirt with the director rihanna talks about domestic violence meanwhile rihanna someone who only needs to change her hair colour to get the medias attention has been praised for her powerful and honest words on domestic violence in an interview with vanity fair the singer spoke about the high profile abuse she suffered at the hands of her exboyfriend chris brown and how it has affected her when asked if she thought she would always be the poster child for victims of domestic abuse rihanna replied how she didnt understand how the victim gets punished over and over i dont want to say get over it because its a very serious thing that is still relevant its still real a lot of women a lot of young girls are still going through it a lot of young boys too its not a subject to sweep under the rug so i cant just dismiss it like it wasnt anything or i dont take it seriously but for me and anyone who has been a victim of domestic abuse nobody wants to even remember it nobody even wants to admit it so to talk about it and say it once much less times is like i have to be punished for it it didnt sit well with me is rap misogynistic this week kanye west was asked about the portrayal of black women in music his answer was surprising i definitely think generally rap is misogynistic he told lou stoppard in a candid twohour interview with fashion site showstudio not that thats justifying the culture he qualified west tried to explain that men who feel trapped or discriminated against by society will use rap as an outlet and often the object of their frustration becomes their partner so lets take that to the idea of a black male in america not getting a job or getting fucked with at his job or getting fucked with by the cops or being looked down upon by this lady at starbucks and he goes home to his girl and this guy is like you just scream at the person thats the closest to you do we still have to remind people assault victims arent to blame meet joey salads an american youtuber who has taken it upon himself to conduct social experiments that show how easy it is to put women in vulnerable situations on nights out his latest video entitled abducting girls which has so far clocked up over views sees salads persuading women to get into his car on the promise of an afterparty before he stops and gives them a telling off for trusting a stranger ostensibly salads is trying to teach the girls a lesson and highlight the dangers of getting into mens cars late at night but its unsurprising that it hasnt gone down too well pushing as it does the blame squarely at the victims door abduction rape and sexual assault happen because of rapists and perpetrators not because of victims or womens behaviour a spokesperson from the survivors trust said to frame it in this way supports prejudice and blame against victims icymi

the campus craze of banning outspoken women from university events and debates across the country is such a gift to the misogynistic mens rights movement that if i were a conspiracy theorist i would be insisting this is a global plot to end womens liberation lies and smears against radical feminists and allies who name male violence as the key way in which we are oppressed are nothing new we are labelled prudes and pearl clutchers slurs previously bandied about by men defending their right to rape at a talk i did earlier this year on feminism several students turned up to hear me with one telling me a heartbreaking story about being cast out by her feminist group because she was a terf trans exclusionary radical feminist and a swerf sex worker exclusionary radical feminist her crime had been to circulate an article i had written about the disgracefully low conviction rate for rape in the uk another emailed me recently explaining how she had been at the meeting at a london university that decided to no platform me from a debate on whether or not prostitution is harmful to women when several of the female students said they wanted to hear the debate the white male leader of that society started shouting that they were all transphobes and whorephobes for supporting me so everyone shut up i dont blame them i have had years of this hostility because of one article i wrote and they do not want the same treatment another student told me she was banned from her feminist society because the flyers she distributed outlining the threat to womens reproductive rights referred to women rather than womb bearers which was deemed transphobic any feminism that names men and mens violence as the problem is being shut down the liberal queeridentifying feminists that celebrate slutwalk pornography and sex work do not get no platformed they are simply not a threat to men and therefore the increasing numbers of men who are leading the troops into no platforming hell are appeased by them the canadian feminist writer meghan murphy went through hell recently after writing an article in which she challenged the notion that the actor laverne cox of orange is the new black was liberating women by posing for the annual nudes issue of allure because cox is transgender and black meghan was accused of being both racist and transphobic with a number of groups demanding that murphy be sacked from her unpaid blog and parttime paid editor position at rabbleca the current climate in universities of creating safe spaces in which no evil must enter is pathetic banning me from speaking by claiming that my very presence would cause harm and even violence to students when they regularly allow men who actually campaign against womens rights to speak is outrageous initially the university of manchester decided to no platform me and not my opponent milo yiannopoulos a vocal antifeminist though he too was later disinvited after protests over the hypocrisy in doing so they handed me a gift here is proof that this is an antifeminist crusade and nothing at all about so called safe spaces no student was harmed in the writing of this article,2015-10,campus

a film premiere yesterday might have alerted you to a feminist activist group intent on disruption with scant regard for the law i refer of course to the suffragettes a film about whom was screened for the first time in london last night joining the hollywood stars were the feminist descendants of the suffragettes a new direct action group called sisters uncut which occupied the red carpet in protest at cuts to domestic violence services women lay on the floor chanting dead women cant vote and were subsequently womanhandled by security in an ironic tribute to the sort of treatment the pankhursts received from the authorities during their protests helena bonham carter said the protest was a perfect response to the film suffragette although im not sure the originals who blew things up and learned martial arts in order to fight the police more effectively would agree they might worry sisters uncut wasnt confrontational enough when asked why protesters had chosen to target the film one attendee latifa responded this film is talking about womens liberation in a very celebratory sense and theres this argument that were in a postfeminist era so that means that our messages more than ever need to heard because there is this delusional element to it all shes right despite suffrage for women being won almost a century ago gender inequality remains stubbornly entrenched as the sisters point out at its very sharpest end is violence against women which kills two women a week in the uk austerity has catalysed an abrupt reversal in the progress of gender equality as womens services begin to run out of funding and get shut down indeed average numbers suggest that on the day of the suffragette premiere women will have been turned away from domestic violence refuges the closure of these services is dangerous for all women but particularly those who rely on specialist domestic violence services like women of colour and trans women escaping domestic violence is a traumatising and emotional process and these women have very specific needs that are often not catered for by generic domestic violence services according to womens aid the tendency towards funding generic rather than specialist domestic violence services will result in the loss of years of acquired expertise in relation to domestic violence currently fewer than one in local authorities run specialist domestic violence services and of the domestic violence services that have closed since were specialist services for black and minority ethnic women i spoke to someone who worked at a migrants charity in who told me things had become so desperate that she was advising pregnant women about which churches might allow them to sleep on the floor this outrageous devaluing of womens lives has been allowed to persist because our society lacks the courage to name the problem that the ideas we teach men and women to have about one another creates a culture in which gendered violence can thrive there are too many men who believe they have the right to own and control the women in their lives and that they are justified in using physical violence and emotional abuse in order to do it the world health organisation argues that sexual violence against women is to an extent rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement in other words men are not naturally more violent than women but are taught to have certain expectations of romantic relationships that can lead some men to assault and in some cases kill their partners politicians need to follow sisters uncuts example and be honest about the reality of domestic violence how it happens and who is most affected violence against women persists because of the dishonesty about consequences of austerity and the relationship between womens safety and economics women rely on public services to mitigate their historically low social status and improve their quality of life take these services away and gender inequality will be exacerbated the statistics bear this out at the end of every cut the chancellor makes to local authorities is a woman who will die avoidably at the hands of a man who promised to love her cuts to public spending are creating orphans who could have grown up with parents these are political choices the government is making and things can be different im glad a group of activist women stormed

life in this society being at best an utter bore and no aspect of society being at all relevant to women there remains to civicminded responsible thrillseeking females only to overthrow the government eliminate the money system institute complete automation and destroy the male sex if i put this on twitter would you call the police its the best first line of anything ever its from valerie solanass scum manifesto i dont think like this all of the time because i am nice also in a long history of offending people i can still never quite tell what will upset who i regret the time for instance when i mocked morris dancers because they are superorganised and really come back at you but the stimulation of offence only ever a click away is the mood music now it is tiring for sure do those who live in this semiaroused state ever get off social media and go outside where i hear people saying all kinds of offensive stuff racist sexist homophobic its all on the bus i get on its unpleasant but on the whole no one is mortally wounded by speech alone public space can be threatening i have been attacked raped and abused in my lifetime for just being not for my views that is part of life for many women the war on women that sees two women killed a week is not even news unless there are some sexy pics and gory details of how some shining girl became another bruised corpse often at the hands of someone she knew thats how many women live thats how many trans women and women of colour live my experience is not special it is sadly normal so i completely stand by bahar mustafa if she used a hashtag that said killallwhitemen she may have said other stupid stuff on twitter the place where women are tweeted abusive crap day in day out if men are seriously fearing for their lives because of this hashtag they can surely organise a safe space indeed they have its called most of the world the latest madness on safe spaces now concerns the writer julie bindel who has been noplatformed by the university of manchesters student union she was due to debate at the universitys free speech and secular society the subject was from liberation to censorship does modern feminism have a problem with a free speech call me wittgenstein but as they have banned her from appearing the answer appears to be yes they have not banned milo yiannopoulos breitbart hypertroll and a mens rights activist maybe milo is just going to sit there talking to himself about the rape fantasies of feminists and the mental illness of all trans people as long as he gets a hunky bodyguard a decent mojito and some selfpromotion he will be fine what the students get out of this debacle who knows the issue is of free speech and how this is being undermined by this safespace policy adopted by student unions superficially it is about being welcoming inclusive and stopping far right explicitly racist speakers now this policy is unthinkingly being used against someone such as bindel who has campaigned against violence against women all her life she is now seen as threatening as she does not adhere to the current feminist orthodoxy around trans issues and sex workers she has repeatedly apologised for articles that have caused offence in the past we all live and learn i agree with her on some things not others thats life feminism contains multitudes and goes in cycles its very amusing to now see the reclamation of armpit hair and shagging about polyamory as new revolutionary acts whereas anyone who raises questions about the construction of gender fake binaries performativity or mentions womens bodies is a terf trans exclusionary radical feminist you can be black or white queer or a campaigner against fgm and you will be decimated by someone whose feminism gets all the boys to the yard the safety that student unions want to give their students is imaginary as is much of the offence safe spaces have been invaluable for rape and abuse survivors for people of colour for addicts whoever needs them university is not meant to be a safe space but a challenging one bindel must be able to talk no one has to listen they can simply not attend you may be vehemently opposed to her views or to mine if an actual idea that gender is largely socially constructed makes you feel upset you will be finding a lot of social science problematic as for biologicalchromosomal theories of sex i guess youre going to have to avoid science college is about learning to think what we end up with here is a man speaking and a woman banned free speech i support bhaha mustafa if all she did was use an offensive hashtag and make some daft tweets i support maryam namazie who was banned and then unbanned for being a secular feminist who might upset muslim students i support jane fae a trans activist who stepped down from a conference on feminism as her views were again thought threatening i support julie bindel i support nimco ali an antifgm campaigner i support women who may offend other women and most certainly men because guess what feminism isnt a safe space its a space full of dangerous ideas at least it is if we are doing it right comments are closed for legal

i have a friend a more than competent professional woman who deals daily with harsh matters and difficult people she has not yet breached the glass ceiling but is heading that way and i hope one day she will break through as an example to other women but asked to tackle the most basic of feminist topics and she confessed recently she breaks into a cold sweat why because she fears the consequences she knows too well the narrow narrow margin between what is and is not ideologically acceptable it was a feminist conference that did for me i was due to speak at feminism in london this month but have now agreed not to apparently because my views veer too far from accepted doctrine the topic of the talk in question was speech and space my view is that the demand for absolute freedom of speech emerges from privilege and that virtual spaces should be policed and protected in ways similar to physical space i have watched over the last couple of years as various mobs have attacked women online caroline criadoperez stella creasy mary beard the list is endless and more must be done to address this online abuse but on other topics the regulation of porn for one i have contrarian views and this was enough for those who were concerned at my presence at the conference to cry havoc suddenly every last word i have written over the years and i write a lot maybe words a year was up for scrutiny every slightest deviation from the true way magnified to make me the enemy behind the scenes individuals whispered that my presence made the space unsafe for some women perhaps this was because of my supposed views on porn but more likely its because i am a trans woman since others holding similar views do not seem to have been briefed against a situation was created in which if i had insisted on speaking i would have undermined both the event and my own thesis there was no good or right option it felt kinder to walk away to collude if you wish in my own silencing to be clear i was not noplatformed and what happened was in no way the fault of the organisers just days later the feminist writer and activist julie bindel has been noplatformed she supported me in my own time of difficulty and was this week barred from a debate at manchester university on whether modern feminism has a problem with free speech again it is safety that is the supposed issue although bizarrely that same institution seems to have no difficulty in inviting milo yiannopoulos to speak a rightwing commentator who has publicly argued that trans people are mentally ill and suggested that rape culture does not exist this situation is not specifically about feminism but something else something dangerous in current discourse it is about absolutism feminist trans green corbynista every fashionable fraction of progressive thought it is the tyranny of the majority the old problem that given the right to make choices the mass will deny that right to dissenting minorities and those who hold uncomfortable views it is bad faith just days after this silencing i struggled to convince some people about words spoken to me directly by an interviewee they apparently knew better than i did about what the individual had said their intuition trumped my experience it is too the forced syllogism the idea that knowing one or two things about a person one therefore knows all and can extrapolate the whole i have many many views some are mainstream some are surprising heaven forfend i am a practising catholic by virtue of which some in lgbt circles insist i obviously support every last reactionary twist and turn of papal policy and in the end it is about silencing this happens only occasionally through the formality of the no platform far more often as in this instance an impossible situation is created which forces a person to step down from speaking the difficulty at a personal level lies in a conflict that i resolve through constant internal discourse i have a right to speak but so too is the right of others to a safe space i accept this is a result of residual catholicism perhaps that if asked to leave or desist i must always consider that request but that is not to say i should always accede to it because otherwise we end up with the kind of discourse that eventually did for the state of poland in the late th century a parliament a debating chamber in which every single individual had the right to veto the deliberations of the whole a situation akin to hazarding all future uk legislation on the chance that it is acceptable to both the green mp caroline lucas and the ukip mp douglas carswell we need safe spaces we also need mutual tolerance without it debate will end not just formally by individuals being denied a platform but totally

the cost of childcare is now so high that some working parents are struggling to break even or paying more for it than they take home latest figures show the average fulltime nursery bill for a child under two now tops an eyewatering a year or in london for too many families it simply does not pay to work concludes the family and childcare trusts report on childcare costs more than twice as many women at than men have found that returning to work after having a child isnt financially worthwhile according to research given exclusively to the observer by the national childbirth trust nct yet for each year a mother is absent from the workplace her future wages will fall by according to the fawcett society mothers of young children who return to work for very little financial gain may do so to maintain their longterm ability to improve their earnings says david finch of thinktank the resolution foundation that way when their children are schoolage and their childcare costs come down theyve kept their careers and maintained their earnings potential research by the thinktank suggests twothirds of unemployed mothers arent working because childcare is too expensive while of mums in work say the cost of childcare prevents them working more paying to work gemma parry knows this dilemma only too well she quit her job as a museum assistant after having ritchie three and joe one it probably would have cost me close to a day to return to work fulltime after childcare and commuting costs id have liked to go back parttime but even that was a bad move financially now im a stayathome mum which i enjoy but i also worry about my career the choice to work was taken away from me and i think thats wrong single mother clare greenhalgh from manchester also quit her fulltime job because she could not afford fulltime childcare after having her son rory seven now she works three days a week as an admin assistant earning just under a year my boss asked me to work fulltime and offered to promote me and almost double my salary i wanted to say yes but id be a month worse off due to childcare costs and unable to make ends meet she thinks she might be better off if she quit but unemployment isnt an option she says i want my child to know you go to work and i want to maintain my skillset and use my brain i wish i could work fulltime i know ill never get promoted or a pay rise if i continue to work parttime and the work can be mundane i feel trapped the cost of not working there are parents who can afford to take the financial hit to be back at their jobs but the cost of childcare means others especially mothers are locked out of the job market says alison garnham of the child poverty action group this is despite evidence that women in their s and s now earn slightly up to more on average than men in fulltime work according to figures from the office for national statistics yet one in five mothers refuses a job offer and one in eight leaves a job due to childcare costs a survey of mumsnet users found unless a mother earns significantly more than her male partner it is likely to be the woman who stops working or goes parttime says cary cooper a professor of organisational psychology and health at the manchester business school women still feel guilty for going out to work instead of spending time with kids men rarely do even when both partners earn roughly the same a womans wage is more likely to be weighed against the total cost of childcare instead of the couple sharing the burden of this expense equally says cooper longterm career damage by the time a mother returns to work fulltime her male partner is typically earning more than her instead of the average pay gap among childless couples according to an oecd report when she retires her typical pension pot is just just over half of a mans average pot according to pension provider lv many women trying to decide whether to go back to their jobs after maternity leave will struggle to pay for childcare and make ends meet most will enjoy parenting yet staying at home can cause longterm damage to careers says elizabeth duff nct spokesperson mothers are damned if they do and damned if they dont if flexible working is a solution every employee now has the right to request flexible working once every months it needs to be highlighted that it is a right to request not an absolute right to be given it which is an important distinction requests must be dated and made in writing ensure to include the change you would like when you want it to start and the impact you think it would have on your employer employers have three months to make a decision employers must have a sound business reason for refusing a request and deal with the request in a reasonable manner by for example assessing the advantages and disadvantages meeting with you to discuss it and offering an appeal process an employer is entitled to reject a flexible working request for business reasons these

feminism v humanism if theres one woman you can count on to fight the good feminist fight in hollywood its surely meryl streep so the internet did a collective double take when the oscarwinner chose not to label herself with the fword in an interview this week when asked by time out if she was a feminist streep responded i am a humanist i am for a nice easy balance its a surprising answer for a woman who has lobbied for the equal rights amendment in her home country and was filmed punching the air during patricia arquettes womens equality speech at the oscars not to mention that the interview in question was for her new film suffragette in which she plays emmeline pankhurst but streep isnt the only female actress aligning herself with humanism rather than feminism sarah jessica parker ruffled feathers earlier this year when she said that inequality isnt just about women any more we would be so enormously powerful if it were a humanist movement susan sarandon too considers herself a humanist rather than an alienating feminist meanwhile taking the debate elsewhere entirely marion cotillard insisted this week that feminism doesnt create equality it creates separation i dont qualify myself as a feminist should we all be spreading the word of humanism rather than feminism vlogger steve shives had this to say on why the two should remain distinct from one another the reason why its called feminism while advocating for gender equality is because females are the gender that are the underprivileged underserved gender you attain gender equality by advocating for the rights of the underprivileged gender others argue that while feminism and humanism have a similar ideal at their core equal treatment for all humanism is not concerned with gender politics is rooted in patriarchy founded as it was by white european men and as judith butler writes supposes that there is just one single idea of what it is to be human of course you can be a feminist and a humanist and its likely if you are one you are also the other hillary and lena streep might not want to but there are some high profile women still happy to label themselves with the f word and none more so than hillary clinton speaking to lena dunham in an interview for the launch of lenny dunhams feminist newsletter clinton was unequivocal im always a little bit puzzled when any woman of whatever age but particularly a young woman says something like well i believe in equal rights but im not a feminist well a feminist is by definition someone who believes in equal rights pirelli and lastly hats

who would possibly give more column space to miranda devine after she denied gender was the cause of domestic violence the editors of rendezview thats who the website run by news corp is the latest in

similarly in the us slate established double x renamed the xx factor in huffington post has huffpost women and vice recently launched broadly these pink ghettoes are distinct but attached to mainstream media and the content consists of daily news through a feminist lens opeds and personal stories that hum with emotion my son has the type of autism no one knows about writer bonnie zampino lamented in mamamia last week while daily life published clementine fords criticism of the fashion industrys hypocritical body positive messages the sites arent identical broadlys ideal readers are pornwatching spliffsmoking bad girls with an eye for justice mamamia emerged from the mummy blogger era and caters to a more conservative crowd womens agenda is for the careerminded woman rendezviews ultimate goal is to be divisive it seems and daily life deals in politics fashion stylish food and outrage they are safe spaces for writers to shoutyourabortion discuss the expectation to have children and recap the bachelorette readers are expected to have ground knowledge of feminism the websites are designed to be the femalefriendly version of an existing site writes kate wilcox in her thesis on womens media and they are important as an alternative to the white malecentric news sites we know that authority and commentary in mainstream media is overwhelmingly provided by men the benefit of rendezview and the rest is that womens voices are heard and legitimised some of these sites also provide a platform to women of colour who would struggle to be published in conservative press celeste liddle who also writes for the guardian is daily lifes authority on indigenous issues and ruby hamad writes regularly about race politics and prejudice considering we are half the population female reader make for lucrative ad revenue for media companies so this explosion of lady sites makes sense but golly if news corp wanted to attract female readers couldnt they be inclusive of women readers in regular news cordoning off feminine views reinforces the understanding that men are default while women are other simone de beauvoir wrote that woman is defined only in relation to man while he is both positive and neutral she is negative he is the subject he is the absolute she wrote in the second sex she is the other men are everywhere while women are over there in a playpen with pictures of yoga poses and celebs beards women can only speak to women but mens opinions are for everyone this manifests in many ways but is terribly obvious when we consider mainstream media the wider publications connected to these websites most notably fairfaxs and news corps news sites depict and analyse a primarily male experience a look at the australians opinion page shows the pool of commenters to be flooded with white dudes having a vagina is not explicitly outlawed but is clearly frowned upon similarly in a study found only of new york times opeds were written by women the male perspective is the default and womens sites relegate the female perspective to a separate arena the womens website model allows the ghettoisation of female writers and the segregation of female issues replacing mainstream inclusivity while women can speak freely in our designated secondary space we remain relatively silenced in mainstream media,2015-10,would possibly give column space miranda

most people will know me as the feminazi lawyer the daily mail labelled me a feminazi after i had the temerity to challenge sexism a crime that apparently justifies invoking the terminology of national socialism it is rather fitting that the term has gained traction among the rightwing media as it was popularised by rightleaning polemicist rush limbaugh in the s although he credits economics professor thomas hazlett for coining the term feminazi is not an innocuous insult according to limbaugh a feminazi is a feminist to whom the important thing in life is ensuring that as many abortions as possible occur in comparing feminists to the nazis limbaugh is cynically deploying iconography of the most odious kind given limbaughs notoriety in labelling people extremists i was interested to investigate how radical his views actually are an internet search for rush limbaugh brings up a seemingly bottomless diatribe against women and i came across the following gem feminism was created to force popular culture to accept ugly women if you thought he couldnt stoop any lower he has also said of women if we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex we want something for it and ill tell you what it is we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch labelling feminists as feminazis is an effective mechanism in deflecting attention from the dark extremism of proponents of the term the word is a direct assertion of misogyny women do not need to be radical to be called a feminazi they simply have to challenge sex inequality advocates of the word contend that the inequalities women face in society are acceptable even inevitable and cannot be changed by movements for justice and equality they define harm inflicted on women as insignificant or fictitious the daily mail reframes sexist comments in professional spaces as harmless compliments while limbaugh defines a womans control over her reproductive choices as part of a programme of mass murder the word is wielded as a weapon to control and conquer the feminist movement it rebukes and intimidates women who challenge vested male power and strive to improve the situation of women words that exploit visceral connections to the nazis stalinists and alqaida socalled galqaida malign feminists as the enemy because they challenge the patriarchal status quo the word feminazi is used by the powerful against the less powerful to silence them one thing that puzzles many is why women label other women feminazis in truth this is likely to be a form of selfprotection and selfadvancement feminism is criticised as a useless movement because it jeopardises the small incremental gains in power women have made a woman calling another woman a feminazi is a way of pandering to the men who valorise women who conform retaliating against being branded a feminazi is imperative if the word is used without meeting visible resistance the woman against whom it is wielded is wounded and many women who watch this play out in popular discourse are hurt women who might have spoken out against gender inequality could now be reluctant to put their head above the parapet due to the consequences the word can therefore be seen as an effective way to silence women using the label to describe someone is a way of legitimising the onslaught of misogynistic abuse and death threats that follow you can say these things to a feminazi without recrimination as the rightwing messaging goes the feminazi deserves it the tragic irony is that every time the word is bandied about without retaliation the power imbalance between men and women is reinforced so how can feminists respond we must recognise that the label is a strategy to put feminists on the defensive by making them feel morally obligated to distinguish feminism from nazism and yet the public promulgation of terms such as feminazi emphasises the need for a movement that seeks the advancement of women appropriating such a deplorable term definitely is not an option women can instead reinforce the potency of feminism by identifying as feminists but the most important response to obscenity is to expose the misogyny being used against women claiming that those who challenge gender inequality are feminazis is arguably libellous it is a false statement because feminists are not nazis and it could be defamatory because being branded some kind of a cryptonazi implies extremist and even homicidal ambitions precisely why limbaugh referred to as many abortions as possible labelling someone a feminazi publicly castigates and vilifies them and creates public perceptions that are untrue it renders them at risk of being stigmatised hated and unemployable all of this for daring to contest the abuse of women let there be no mistake a war of words is upon us it commenced because women spoke out now words are being used against women in an attempt to silence them,2015-10,people know feminazi

the western australian government has announced a m plan to tackle high levels of family violence in the kimberley including an extra m for teams of police and child protection workers to reset remote aboriginal communities with unacceptable levels of violence the new kimberley family violence regional plan aims to ground responses to family violence in aboriginal law and culture by working with elders and law people from the kimberleys plus language and tribal groups it includes m for support services and to fund four family safety teams which will work with victims and perpetrators of family violence was child protection minister helen morton said family violence had become so prevalent in the kimberley that it has become almost normalised in some communities as being an acceptable way of behaviour government statistics cited in the kimberley plan show aboriginal women are three times more likely to be physically assaulted by their partner than nonaboriginal women morton said the plan which was written by victoria hovane an aboriginal woman from broome and a leading expert on aboriginal family violence was designed to tie into the federal governments new m domestic violence package it will involve using elders and aboriginal law and culture to argue that family violence is not acceptable and it will reinforce the need for mandatory reporting of family violence which has slipped among both aboriginal and nonaboriginal people in the community who view violence as a way of life among aboriginal people it also will relocate the reset teams of police and child protection workers to the kimberley you must always remember that these people dont want to have that unacceptable behaviour occurring in their community either morton said the plan ties into the governments remote community reform program announced after the wa premier colin barnett said that up to remote aboriginal communities faced closure first citing a lack of funding and then claiming they had dysfunctionally high levels of child sexual abuse talk of closures has since been rescinded morton is one of two ministers steering the remote community reforms the other is the leader of the national party terry redman the most obvious connection to remote community reforms are the reset teams which morton said go in for about months at a time to reset a communitys beliefs around normalised behaviour where we have recognised that that communitys moral compass has got lost that is what happened in oombulgurri an extremely remote community km northwest of wyndham when members of the child sex abuse squad swooped in for what was known as operation sheepshank to investigate reports of a paedophile ring the results of that investigation and an earlier coronial inquest into a spate of suicides led to the state government making the decision to close the community in oombulgurri looms over discussions of remote aboriginal communities in wa as both proof that the government can and will shut a community down and an argument on the governments side that sometimes extreme action is necessary asked if communities visited by the reset teams would assured that they would not go the way of oombulgurri if they did not improve morton said in lots of ways the community will make that determination themselves we have indicated over and over and over again that we are not going to close any of the communities in the kimberley if we can make sure that those communities are going to continue to be safe for those people that live in the community and in particular for those children morton said mary cowley the chief executive of aboriginal family law services said she would reserve judgment on the plan until she had seen how it worked on the ground but said she was concerned about the increased focus on the reset teams which would not help to build trust with aboriginal people cowley attributed the reluctance of aboriginal women to report family violence to police to a concern that their children may be taken away aboriginal people make up of the population of wa but of the children in care in the kimberley cowley said of the children in outofhome care are aboriginal i have been visiting some of the female prisons in the state and talking to some of the women who are victims that have become perpetrators and asked them how do we get you to come to us at the start rather than at the th hour cowley told guardian australia they say the reason they dont come to us is the fear of their children being removed and i say thats fair enough but what do your children feel about you being incarcerated the women cowley talked to are often jailed for retaliating against a violent partner cowley said there needed to be a bipartisan commitment for a longterm approach towards reducing family and sexual violence what we have today is a term of government funding and a term of government solution she said when it comes to aboriginal people you are talking about intergenerational trauma it will take generations to fix,2015-10,western australian government ha announced plan tackle high level family violence kimberley including extra team police

operating theatres are a hostile environment for women and surgery still appears to be old boys club one of the uks leading female surgeons has said jyoti shah a consultant urological surgeon at burton hospitals nhs foundation trust has called for a cultural change in the field so women do not feel uncomfortable speaking on the bbc radio s today programme shah said surgery still remains very male dominated and it does still appear as an old boys club and youre very much an outsider as a woman youre trying to break into their gang almost and that culture is quite engrained in surgery shah cited an number of examples of sexist behaviour in the industry such as when a female surgeon she knew was operating alongside a consultant who deliberately brushed against her breasts other examples were less obvious she said such as female surgeons being referred to as nurses and being asked to make tea women are tough resilient creatures were facing this culturally engrained behaviour by our

in a surprise move by the normally prowomen conservative government feminism is to be dropped from alevel politics women were taking up far too much room on the syllabus which meant that some men didnt have the requisite amount of space required for the proper ventilation and comfort of their genitals so the women had to go in a revised version of the course which is to be put to consultation the section on feminism has been removed along with any mention of gender equality and the patriarchy and replaced with lots of drawings of ejaculating penises from the pen of education secretary and minister for women and equalities nicky morgan gender equality is all very well in theory but its just not practical when you try to implement it on the alevel syllabus or on public transport now i dont want to sound paranoid but a pattern is starting to emerge a few things have happened recently and indeed over the last years that make me think there are some individuals in positions of power who are unenthusiastic about the emancipation of women there seems to have been a concerted effort to airbrush from the history books the women who were not married off at three or who did not die in childbirth before i started reading up on women and feminism in after i saw a gap in the standup comedy market the only famous women i knew of were the virgin mary margaret thatcher and esther rantzen and i didnt want the careers of any of those women had i known about hatshepsut and eva peron and linda carter earlier i might have won a chortle award before i was but its no joke in january this year the ultraorthodox jewish newspaper hamevaser digitally removed all traces of women from a photograph of a unity march after the charlie hebdo attacks in paris due to modesty concerns when world leaders linked arms to march against terrorism angela merkel immodestly dressed in a long woollen coat gloves and a scarf was removed from the image hamevaser also cut out the mayor of paris anne hidalgo though the picture editor left her dark glove on the sleeve of a marcher i like to think of that glove as the ghostly decapitated hand of mary wollstonecraft a feminist version of thing from the addams family which goes around slapping misogynists faces every time they say something stupid then a few weeks ago the british passport office unveiled the new creative united kingdom passport celebrating years of british talent but was able to think of only two women against seven men the mathematician and writer ada lovelace and the architect elisabeth scott naturally scotts face was superimposed on to the body of a cheerleader and lovelace was pictured inside a giant cocktail glass licking a cherry now nicky morgan who presumably feels shes done quite enough for women in the year shes held the post has decided she no longer sees the need for feminism on the alevel syllabus surely if were serious about achieving gender equality we need to educate and inform our children for they will inherit the earth or whats left of it and that includes teaching them about the battles fought and won by women for the benefit of all humanity removing feminism from politics is like removing the female reproductive system from biology im doing my best but im out of my depth i often have very young girls in my audiences once a group of teenagers sat horrified in the front row for the first minutes and who can blame them whats not embarrassing about a shouting middleaged gloucester woman whos just said the word vagina and whose mock outrage involves spit dribbling down her chin but then afterwards these girls tell me that they found the link they made the connection between feminism the ideology and feminism the life tool they saw how being called slags for not flirting with the boys is connected to being catcalled on the way to and from school and how their looks are still considered the most important thing about them and how the issues they face simply for being girls are connected to issues that every girl and woman faces and that the battle to resolve all these issues is called feminism but these girls should know all this already because they should be learning

federal funding for rent assistance and homelessness services will be reassessed to provide better services for victims and survivors of domestic violence and guarantee value for money the federal social services minister christian porter has said although homelessness and housing assistance falls largely under the remit of state governments the federal government provides money for several programs state governments and service providers have criticised the federal government for uncertainty about the longterm funding of some of these programs including the national partnership agreement on homelessness they argued that funding uncertainty had led to womens refuges being shut and women and children being turned away porter said the way the funding was allocated was under the spotlight one of the things that the treasurer spoke about is reassessing that global amount of funding which is at the point of about bn and try to work out ways to get better value in the long term for that spend he said on wednesday im engaged with the treasurer about how we can provide better continuity but also get better results for what is a large expenditure money for the national partnership agreement on homelessness was due to run out in june and the federal government stepped in only weeks before its expiry date funding is now guaranteed until june domestic violence is one of the main drivers of homelessness in women and a recent senate inquiry recommended that the partnership agreement be funded for at least four years to allow service providers to plan to coincide with white ribbon day on wednesday the prime minister malcolm turnbull and porter launched a study into attitudes on violence against women it found that victimblaming was rampant and deeply entrenched community attitudes were a barrier to reducing family and domestic violence turnbull said violence against women and children was one of the great shames of our nation and said men needed to intervene when they saw other men mistreating women clearly a big part of this is that passive dismissive attitude its not a term ive heard before but i think it acutely sums up the cultural problem that were grappling with he said weve all got a shared responsibility here also on wednesday labor released its policy on domestic violence leave saying if it won office it would mandate five days of leave so survivors could attend court find accommodation or seek counselling survivors should not have the added stress of missing work and all the financial uncertainty that creates the opposition leader bill shorten said if we do not provide them this support they are more likely to have to stay where they are turnbull said that the productivity commission would look into the proposal as part of its review of fair work laws we will consider it very carefully he said during question time the australian chamber of commerce and industry has criticised the proposal saying small businesses cannot afford to pay for mandatory days of domestic leave they must be free to respond to the circumstances of their employees in effective ways that work for both parties its chief executive kate carnell said these may include granting time off enabling access to other forms of leave and affording maximum flexibility with working hours and locations the queensland premier annastacia palaszczuk on wednesday announced that queensland public servants would be entitled to days of domestic violence leave a year my government wants to be a champion for workplace cultural

the media often sensationalises domestic violence against women and disproportionately covers female perpetrators of violence a study into international reporting of violence against women has found media reporting of the most salacious aspects of violence against women provides the public with a perspective that is provocative but not representative said the report media representations of violence against women and their children a number of studies found that female perpetrators of violence including sexual and physical forms of violence as well as femaleperpetrated homicide of a male partner accounted for a high proportion of the total volume of media reports on violence despite the rarity of these events the report published by our watch and australias national research organisation for womens safety anrows found there were widely established patterns of reporting in australia and internationally that were overly simplistic distorted and inadequate and increased the publics confusion our watch chaired by the former senator natasha stott despoja is a federally funded national body established to address preventing violence against women and their children by motivating community action it also found newspapers focused on the method of the murder rather than the history of violence as if it was more important for readers to know how but not why men kill their partners many reports also shifted blame from the male perpetrators to their female victims and often relied on police comments for context the australian authors used largely peerreviewed scientific papers to examine the way newspapers and television reports portrayed violence against women unfortunately reporting on violence against women that challenges rather than reinforces cultural and social norms about gender is still the minority they found while the overrepresentation in the news of female perpetrators of violence may reflect the news value of novelty one study argued that violence by women is considered more deviant more anxietyprovoking more transgressive than mens violence and therefore more in need of explanation stories about women being attacked by strangers were also overrepresented this cultivated fear in the community and confusion about who was really at risk one common theme across much of the media reporting in australia and the us was that the social context in which maleperpetrated violence against women occurred was often excluded however if the media reports included statistics on the extent of the problem or expert analysis about the social phenomena of gendered violence they would be more balanced the report said the media frequently mirrors societys confusion and ambivalence about violence against women and that they could play a role in dispelling myths and reinforcing information about the true nature and extent of the problem reporting on violence against women that challenged rather than reinforced cultural and social norms about gender was still the minority the report said but there was some good news although of the newspaper articles were sensational the rate was dropping in the australian media

a study has revealed high levels of victim blaming when australians are told about cases of girls and young women experiencing disrespectful and aggressive behaviour from their male peers the report to be released by the turnbull government on wednesday said while there was strong community support for ending extreme violence against women the attitudes that perpetuated the problem were firmly entrenched among many adults and children in australia the publication coincides with white ribbon day when labor will also announce a policy to enshrine five days of domestic violence leave in national employment standards the research firm tns said service providers backed the need for primary prevention targeting younger audiences and the involvement of influential others such as mothers fathers older siblings teachers sporting coaches religious leaders managers and peers but having spent hours in workshops with people in august tns warned of the significant challenges in achieving community change as a result of pervasive automatic responses including blaming the victim and minimising the behaviour of men and boys workshop participants were provided with details of hypothetical scenarios of gender inequality aggression and verbal aggression and were told the male and female characters did not know each other despite this when asked their perception on why the behaviour had occurred the response from the majority of influencers male and female was to automatically question the role of the female before rebuking the behaviour described the report said boys and young men were fast to externalise the behaviour by blaming others particularly the female a phenomenon researchers said was already present among boys as young as one boy aged in the to category told researchers perhaps the girl is not giving him attention the report said girls and young women were consistently fast to internalise or blame themselves when presented the identical scenarios with one teenager saying the victim might have done something wrong to him in the past the study also examined hidden beliefs preventing influencers from talking to young people on the topic of gender inequality and disrespectful behaviour fathers said they were worried such a conversation would jeopardise their relationship with the child or that they would be exposed as a hypocrite mothers expressed concerns that getting involved would cause an escalation of the threat cause embarrassment and elevate fear among daughters males were frequently given the benefit of the doubt where females were given the burden of proof to establish no provocation had occurred the report said thus there is a consistent norm for externalisation away from males for males the experience is considered an opportunity learn right from wrong and part of growing up for females the experience is considered an opportunity build resilience and coping mechanisms there is a consistent norm that gender inequality disrespectful and aggressive behaviour is a part of childhood a rite of passage malcolm turnbull said the research painted a disturbing picture and it was utterly unacceptable that so many people were ready to excuse and diminish the behaviour and blame the victim not all disrespect of women ends up in violence against women but all violence against women begins with disrespecting women the prime minister said the social services minister christian porter said the research commissioned by the department of social services would help inform efforts to address domestic violence issues too often adults blame the victim saying it takes two to tango porter said too often adults believe that disrespectful and aggressive behaviour among young males towards young females is some form of rite of passage that should be understood rather than judged saying boys will be boys as a part of the research parents were asked to respond to a scenario where their son is seen throwing a bottle at a girl in a fit of rage the mothers responses included this is not such a huge deal and its just a thing teenage boys do fathers responded by saying boys will be boys and its tough being a kid the minister for women michaelia cash said the jointly funded m national campaign to reduce violence against women was due to begin early next year the campaign backed by the council of australian governments would aim to equip influencers to help break the cycle labor meanwhile is set to promise to make domestic and family violence leave a universal workplace right the labor leader bill shorten said the trauma was often compounded by workplace and financial uncertainty if elected he would insert five days of paid domestic and family violence leave in the national employment standards which set out the minimum entitlements for employees covered by the national workplace relations system some companies already offer such leave and unions have been proposing it in enterprise bargaining negotiations domestic and family violence leave will benefit both those who have experienced violence as well as business through improved productivity increased employee retention and reduced absenteeism he said consider the time required in courts meeting with lawyers financial advisers the school principal counselling sessions for people who have experienced violence which is

new parents who apply for mortgages from some of the biggest lenders are being asked to prove that they are going back to work before their income can be included in affordability checks questions posed by the observer to the biggest lenders found that those on maternity or shared parental leave are asked to provide evidence that they will go back to work within three months of their application when they take out a mortgage from skipton building society virgin money and metro bank if they are not returning to work within three months their return to work income may not be included in the checks and the mortgage may be calculated on their pay during the period of maternity or parental leave other lenders including barclays rbs and natwest will base their decision on the salaries applicants expect to earn when they return to work rather than their pay while they are on leave halifax will normally do the same while coventry building society will take an applicants return to work income into consideration along with other factors if there is going to be a break or a drop in your normal income while you are on leave skipton coventry metro clydesdale bank and halifax will ask how you intend to pay the mortgage during this period some lenders will want to see savings in place to cover the payments says david blake of which mortgage advisers others will decline to lend at all to someone on maternity or paternity pay says pete mugleston of onlinemortgageadvisorcouk many of the lenders stressed they will make decisions on a casebycase basis the price of pregnancy in a recent uswitch survey of female applicants aged about one in said they felt they had been discriminated against by lenders over their plans to start a family sarah oleary was five months pregnant when her broker informed her she would struggle to get a mortgage i am an air stewardess so i couldnt hide that i was pregnant it was written on my payslip that i couldnt fly and was carrying out maternity ground duties for which i was paid a guaranteed wage supplement but my broker said most lenders wouldnt take into account the majority of my income only my husbands because i wasnt working normally and earning flight pay and sales commissions oleary was planning to return to work fulltime while her mother looked after her baby for free but these lenders were assuming because i was pregnant that my career was over and id never earn my normal salary again the couple eventually managed to borrow from nationwide after going to the lender direct but lost the house they wanted to buy i cried for days last month the financial conduct authority began investigating competition in the mortgage market to assess whether lenders have been unfairly rejecting mortgage applications since lending rules were tightened in april if a lender makes assumptions that a woman cant repay a mortgage purely because she is pregnant she may have a claim for pregnancy discrimination says ros bragg director of charity maternity action what lenders can ask lenders are not allowed to ask whether you are pregnant or on maternity leave when you apply for a mortgage such a question would potentially be discriminatory under the equality act says ray boulger of broker john charcol however tighter lending rules mean they are lawfully entitled and indeed required to take into account future changes in your incomings and outgoings of course having a baby can impact on both mugleston says according to the council for mortgage lenders they gather this information to try to reduce the risk of borrowers taking on debt commitments that could become unaffordable so lenders will typically ask if you are aware of any changes to your income or expenditure in the future if you answer yes because you are expecting a child the underwriter will usually assess whether you can afford the mortgage as though you already have an additional dependent says mugleston you should also expect childcare costs to be factored in most lenders will also ask additional questions about your salary when you return to work the length of your maternity leave and whether you plan to return fulltime and request that your employer provides a letter of intent confirming these facts what to tell your lender a quarter of the women surveyed by uswitch said they had intentionally hidden family plans from lenders if you withhold information the risk is that if you are granted the mortgage you might not be able to afford it as the lender will have been unable to make a realistic assessment says cml spokeswoman sue anderson however you could argue that a child isnt born until its born says simon checkley of brokers private finance if you dont consider your pregnancy to be relevant to your application why disclose it if you apply via a broker it is reasonable for a broker to take the same stance if that is your wish boulger agrees a broker doesnt have to disclose the fact but they do have a duty to satisfy themselves that youll be able to afford your mortgage after the baby is born and to answer the lenders questions honestly however he says brokers know which lenders ask which questions and can choose one which doesnt ask a question you cant answer honestly rbs and natwest for example ask borrowers to disclose foreseeable changes to their circumstances over the next five years while santander only asks if they know of anything at the time or in the near future which will affect their financial position you will be expected to sign a declaration that the application has been completed truthfully says david hollingworth of london amp country if you lie technically your lender could repossess your property but in practice that would be a last resort adds boulger how to improve your chances apply before you get pregnant or before you take a test early on you may feel justifiably uncertain about answering yes to a question about future changes to your income and expenditure at that point youve probably not disclosed your pregnancy to anyone at all for obvious reasons says ray boulger of broker john charcol make sure you can afford the mortgage and never lie on a form but dont volunteer information that is not asked for if youre in the later stages of pregnancy check out the product transfers available from your existing lender typically no affordability questions will then be asked if you have savings to cover any period of leave or are going to reduce your childcare costs by asking family members to look after the baby include this information on your application if you think youve been discriminated against complain to the lender if this doesnt produce a result call the financial services ombudsman says ros bragg from charity

after a long break since the last contribution to the niche yet compelling literary genre that is the martin amis i loved it is all the more frustrating that a potentially important addition by germaine greer is due to emerge only in quotes and paraphrase discovered in the archive greer sold for m to her alma mater the university of melbourne this word document is entitled the long letter to a short love or and was written in while greer was on a lecture tour around the us and canada brief extracts suggest that along with its amisrelated effusions it is a crafted travelogue maybe in the line of one of fanny burneys letterjournals and potentially an even more fascinating communication direct from that benighted decade than flashbacks of amis lounging about in his velves though since the greer affair seems to have overlapped with more public relationships we should presumably feel the absence in her version of the table talk that swirled around amis much hilarity sprung from juvenile word games wrote julie kavanagh substituting sock for house in wellknown titles or phrases as in bleak sock the sock of windsor margaret simons the academic who uncovered the document hoped it could be published as a book amis and greer were at the centre of the changes that the world was going through and its an extraordinary window about what it was like to be alive at that time as one of the most famous people in the world she told the guardian but greer reportedly objected reluctant to embarrass others amis who actually helped kavanagh factcheck her sweet short memoir of their relationship is presumably not among them given his documented difficulties with feminists some of them irked to the point of denying him literary prizes adoring testimony from notionally the senior liberator may amount to counterevidence he would not find objectionable then again greers romantic history features a threeweek marriage to a drunken but muscular builder called paul du feu during which she told a television audience she was unfaithful seven times after feu went on to build a career on greers infatuation she shared with telegraph readers some marital highlights including their final exchange he turned to me and sneered drunk as usual i could have any woman in this room except me i said and walked away for ever even allowing for the fact that greer was stung into that disclosure by yet another du feu kissntell she has shared enough personal information notably the memoir daddy we hardly knew you for there to be a strong argument for the university of melbourne being allowed to cast this further light on her interior life while she can respond to its reception by the time of the long letter she had already mined private experience in her hugely influential polemic the female eunuch at various stages of my life she reassures readers in the final chapter revolution i have lived with men of known violence two of whom had convictions for grievous bodily harm and in no case was i ever offered any physical aggression because it was abundantly clear from my attitude that i was not impressed by it that greer subsequently became an unwilling in one case unsuspecting supplier of copy to other biographers could well account for a determination to prevent further exploitation of her words her talent her adventures she called christine wallace author of a curiously obs amp gynaefocused biography untamed shrew a dung beetle and intestinal flora and warned her if you go near my mother youll have your kneecaps broken wallace went near her mother the novelist david plante a former friend did not even let on as greer confided freely about her sexual past that she would shortly be featuring in his book difficult women along with a couple of fabulous sad drunks jean rhys and sonia orwell he had no idea how deeply i would resent being made to utter nambypamby plantespeak was greers objection but the long letter is her words part of an archive that is not exclusively academic it includes diaries exchanges with warren beatty can we go on like this wb caveat venditor and if greers concern is genuinely for embarrassable peers cant identities be disguised should the university of melbourne require any further excuse for publication it is surely time that some opponents of greers right to speak in public were reminded why people ever wanted her to do so to judge by the sniggers that greeted the amis news yearoldwoman once had sex shock it is not universally understood that there is anything more to greer than her refusals expressed in dependably provocative terms to agree that trans women are as much women as she is questioned on this theme by a student audience after a threatened speech on women and power did after all take place she duly outraged them with i dont believe a woman is a man without a cock if theres one thing greer still has in common with amis its a huge talent to increase concern for their rhetorical victims and like his remarks on muslims hers on transgender women have served you could argue mainly to isolate greer to anoint her the face of the past as one of her young noplatformers demanded recently in the daily telegraph couldnt this establishment fogey this coward this bullying thcentury dinosaur start to learn from her juniors you know basic politeness or what the once aweinspiring greer might call nambypamby plantespeak how could she ever have written antiestablishment articles such as i am a whore in that another extraordinary woman the late professor lisa jardine recalled encountering greer in at a university dinner where the latter talked over the speeches greer was denouncing bras to an audience astonished at the very idea that a woman could speak so loudly and out of turn and that words such as bra and breasts or maybe she said tits could be uttered amid the pseudomasculine solemnity of a college dinner if greer wont talk nicely perhaps its because insults ungenteel coarseness and breathtaking truculence were before and after the female eunuch indivisible from her theoretical rejection of the submissive feminine ideal as well as being rude to trans women greer has been dreadfully sometimes preposterously rude to other women over a prolific half century not just to prying intestinal flora and hobbitfooted interviewers but to fat women thin women older women younger women including the guardian colleague arraigned for fuckme shoes and julia gillard australian prime minister big arse organ grinders monkey asked on newsnight if she wasnt hurtful to trans women greer said try being an old woman for goodness sake people get hurt all the time im not about to walk on eggshells the same superb indifference should obviously apply to the shy players of the

when i started doing standup about feminism two things happened the first was that pickup artists mens rights activists and top gear fans stopped waiting for me after gigs with flowers and chocolates and engagement rings not all of them but the vast majority the second and far more problematic thing was that feminists started coming and waiting for me afterwards with flowers and chocolates and engagement rings suffice it to say that this cross section of ideologies made for a much less orderly queueing system my new leftwing liberal feminist audience made my job much harder as you are all well aware the left and particularly feminists have no sense of humour it is easier to make a roomful of mourners laugh than a roomful of feminists just ask germaine greer whose subtle nuanced irony is often taken at face value but not only do feminists have no sense of humour they dont want anyone else to have one either once during one of my shows a prominent antihumour feminist gagged a laughing male audience member by stuffing four always ultra nighttime sanitary pads into his open laughing mouth sometimes i long for the good old days when i was just heckled by men to get my mammaries out unfortunately now that ive unwittingly attracted an intelligent audience who care about humanity and injustice im held to a much higher standard rightly or wrongly everything i say is scrutinised and picked apart for inconsistencies or flaws something rightwing commentators need never worry themselves about when katie hopkins declared on this morning that her children would not be permitted to play with feral common kids named after geographical locations such as brooklyn or london even though her own child is called india no one cared when i criticised the pen manufacturer bic for inventing an ergonomically designed genderspecific pen for womens hands the bic for her and subsequently called my book a book for her as a satire on gendered products i was called out for having double standards most of the time though im grateful for my enlightened audience at least they remind me how to behave and if as jeremy clarkson allegedly did i subjected a colleague to a sustained verbal attack which included me calling him a lazy irish cunt then punched him in the face which resulted in him needing hospital treatment im pretty sure my audience would feel disappointed im not sure a million of them would sign an online petition calling on the leicester square theatre to reinstate me its unlikely david camerons daughter nancy would go on hunger strike until i was allowed back on radio s news quiz i doubt the police would allow laura bates from the everyday sexism project to drive an armoured vehicle through london to deliver the petition to broadcasting house unless she was waving pompoms and so it was that clarkson free from the shackles of accountability to either his fans or his friends in government became a martyr for the right his attack on his producer oisin tymon for not providing him with a hot steak was transformed from a straightforward case of bullying and violence in the workplace into an issue of free speech the bbcs entirely appropriate decision to suspend clarkson pending an investigation became a triumph for the politically correct brigade clarkson although sacked by the bbc lost no fans through his actions far from the incident ending his career he can now look forward to a hugely lucrative contract with amazon what a wonderful example to set for britains children and hopkins weighed in again calling on tymon to man up as though its up to the victim to deal with bullying rather than it being up to idiots to learn how to behave and to those in positions of power to punish them now tymon has decided to sue clarkson for racial discrimination in the days following the attack and faced with death threats by clarksonloving louts the top gear producer maintained a dignified silence clarkson meanwhile used the media furore to gain political points by tweeting ed miliband sorry ed it seems i knocked your im a human piece down the news agenda i expect tymon aware of how clarksons career and behaviour is unaffected by the incident has decided to seek some justice me im just trying to write bigoted material in order to cultivate more of a rightleaning audience i need a break bridget christie appears at the

international womens day is on march hours of the annually available set aside to celebrate women and all of their achievements and people get furious about it surely you might think you could only be cross about it because that definitely isnt enough time to celebrate the achievements of over than of the population but no on twitter at least every march thousands of men and the occasional woman tweet something along the lines of international womens day so whens international mens day this churlish response is supposed to make us consider the massive inequality and sexism of there being a whole day dedicated to women because there would never be a day like that to venerate men it wouldnt be allowed because of political correctness gone mad youd be laughed off the planet if you dared to suggest such a thing in this day and age so you can see why these antisexist warriors are up in arms except there is an international mens day its today i hope that answers your question guys i love the fact that the kind of cheesehelmets who feel the need to question the concept of international womens day dont even know there is already a day for men an official one rather than the regular days where they get more pay and power and privilege i love it when people try to manufacture an injustice out of a position of clear superiority its all so transparently selfcentred its the impulse that drives your kids on mothers day or fathers day to whine when will there be a childrens day though at least the children have the excuse of being children and thus naturally selfobsessed and unable to spot that the world pretty much revolves around them already but delightfully and to keep this analogy spot on there actually is an international childrens day its on june that wont assuage your complaining spawn of course because like the grownups questioning international womens day they are probably asking when will i get someone to wait on me and bring me breakfast in bed and let me put my feet up and watch the telly when will that happen you know apart from every single fucking day these people must be furious every day that isnt their own birthday why arent i getting any presents so for the last two international womens days i have tried to highlight this stupidity i have got up early logged on to twitter and searched for the phrase international mens day found every single person who has tweeted the question and responded to them all individually its november there are thousands to get through it goes on relentlessly for hours and hours but i try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people who dont even think just to check google to make sure theyre not making an arse of themselves is very funny and shows exactly why an international womens day is necessary incidentally nobody tweets me back to say oh thanks for the information i was wondering when it was almost like they dont want to know the answer to their own question my hope is that if i can spend a day a year dealing with this issue then that means that everyone else can get on with making international womens day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get so i let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves though not many of them do when it comes along weirdly of course on november my timeline is now full of people jokingly asking me when international womens day is and it seems only fair for me to promote women on mens day so i let them know its march but this year i am going to celebrate men as well by helping to promote target ovarian cancer who for one day want to give a shout out of gratitude to the men who support the women in their lives who are affected by this disease every year women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and lose their lives so this international mens day target ovarian cancer are highlighting that men matter too and saying thank you to those husbands fathers brothers partners and friends who have also been affected by ovarian cancer and i am fully expecting to have to deal with a bunch of idiots asking whens ovarian cancer day because those blinkers work really well and block out all sense of irony or shame well dont worry world ovarian cancer day is may people can find more information about ovarian cancer on the target ovarian cancer website and people can find more information on the date of international mens day by browsing through my twitter feed on march,2015-11,international womens day march hour annually

which rites of passage make an adult is it being able to live independently without parental support having a stable career being married or making a lifelong commitment owning your own home or is it being responsible for the wellbeing of another human life in other words becoming a parent yourself these are the traditional markers of adulthood of stability responsibility and independence from an early age most of us grow up thinking that we will achieve some if not all of these things but if you asked me a yearold woman whether i fulfilled most of these criteria youd have to deduce that i am essentially living a prolonged adolescence i live in a shared rented flat with my longterm boyfriend and another flatmate where the rent will remain affordable only if the landlords decline to hike it again last year we had a a month increase i have a freelance income that fluctuates wildly im in no position to get a mortgage not just in london but anywhere in the uk even if the latter were a possibility id have to move to a part of the country where there is very little of the work i rely upon asking my parents for a deposit is not an option nor is it for my boyfriend and why should they give us money i worry enough as it is about how they will get by in old age as i approach my s i cant help worrying what happens when i decide i want a baby the average age of british mothers hit for the first time in this is often framed as a result of women choosing to focus on careers before they decide to have children very little has been said about those women or indeed couples who want to have children but whose circumstances prevent them from doing so i have always known that i wanted children and because of disabilities in my family i was told it would be better for me to do it young or at least before i was or so but i graduated into the recession and following a number of unpaid internships and a couple of years spent establishing a still unpredictable freelance career i only just feel as though im getting on my feet the idea of having a baby in my current situation is unthinkable for a start i couldnt afford to take maternity leave and the state maternity allowance of a week would nowhere near cover us i long ago accepted that i wouldnt own a house by the time i got pregnant and was never prepared to let that get in my way i was born into a shared house myself but it was a big alternative coop and my parents lived in the attic what single young professional flatmate is going to put up with a screaming baby in a tiny twobed not one i know these hurdles to the world of adulthood continue to be a great source of sadness and anxiety and im not alone for swathes of people in their s and s who largely thought they would be at least a bit sorted by now achieving the adult lives they want seems a distant fantasy spiralling property prices coupled with the fetishisation of housing as an investment expressed through buytolet properties and often poor rental conditions means secure housing is off the table for many of us as we continue to subsidise our much richer landlords the average price for a starter home rose to this year requiring an average deposit of or the recession unstable and unreliable unemployment low pay compounded by a pensions shortfall and an ageing population have all led to a situation in which many members of my generation feel not only shortchanged but helpless when it comes to building some semblance of a stable family life while our generational predecessors the baby boomers reaped the rewards of free university education and affordable property prices we have been disproportionately affected by austerity andrea is a university administrator from bradford id love to start a family she says but thats just not going to happen and it really really upsets me i spend hours looking at facebook at the photos of my friends babies and making presents for them i learned to knit a few years ago and have made various booties hats and coats i get a lot of compliments at baby showers i hate baby showers i do all this knowing that it cant happen for me because of the hours i have to work in order to have a career in order to have any kind of job security andrea works a hour week commuting for three hours a day but still feels home ownership is not a realistic prospect id probably get a mortgage but where the hell are we supposed to find kplus for a deposit from the challenges that young women like andrea are facing when it comes to settling down are compounded she says by that perennial difficulty of balancing a career with having children within my industry the women in positions of power are either nonparents or came to the industry after they had children i dont know one woman in the grades above mine who has young children andreas situation is compounded by the media coverage of pregnancy statistics those have a baby by or youre sterile you selfish careerdriven hussy headlines she says andrea wanted to remain anonymous as did most of the people i spoke to for various reasons generation y are used to being accused of whining when we talk about our frustrations and we are sensitive to that weve been brought up in a somewhat statusobsessed society too so mentioning financial difficulties leads to feelings of shame some young women were concerned that admitting to the desperate desire for a child might harm their career prospects but by far the most commonly cited reason is that they didnt want to hurt their parents feelings by discussing how in contrast to the parents of some of their peers they are unable to give them that vital leg up everyone i spoke to wanted to stand on their own two feet but they were aware that their parents shared their feelings of powerlessness and sadness it would kill my father to have this printed one woman said hes a proud man on the whole our parents generation is far better off the recent living standards squeeze has played out differently across the generations says matt whittaker chief economist at the resolution foundation younger people experienced the sharpest increase in unemployment and the biggest fall in pay while employment among older people has surged these shifts have been amplified by welfare changes with cuts to working age benefits contrasting with protections for pensioners but there was evidence of a divergence in experience even before the financial crisis hit rising housing costs have further widened the divide between generation rent and the baby boomers jealousy towards baby boomers is an everyday occurrence youll be sitting in a bar with friends and hear them lament the fact that their parents had bought a house by the time they were my mother had already had me and my sister by the time she was my age one friend said gloomily when the subject came up generation y or millennials if you must are still often portrayed as existing in a state of perpetual kidulthood were peter pans who never want to grow up yet many of us are desperate to do so unaffordable housing and living costs are often portrayed as a london problem why not simply move detractors say as though career opportunity family ties or personal finances are not an issue yet i spoke to people in their s and s from all over the uk and many felt the same way that their chances of getting to the point where they are stable enough to settle down and have children are slim to none many of them feel great sadness about this not only because they look to their parents generation and see opportunities theyve never had but because a gulf is opening within our own generation between those who can start a family or whose parents can help them get on the property ladder and those who cant the number of people who have said i should ask my dad for a deposit andrea says as if his life doesnt matter any more my dad might live for another years i hope he does and his care will cost he needs his money while andreas work life is relatively stable sophie who is feels her employment circumstances mean that having a baby is offlimits since graduating ive had a series of jobs that dont equal a career ive recently left my job and am doing temp work and a vocational course that should get me to where i want to be finally she says adding that she wouldnt have been able to do this without the support of her partner who at is more established i would like reasonable maternity pay and a role to return to after having a baby sophie says but that seems like an almost impossible dream she worries about her partner too when i think about the time it might take me to be well established in a new career four years i think about my partners worry that he will be an old father and wont have the time to be a good grandfather the more people i spoke to the more apparent it became that this is not just about generational divides but about class interviewees were forever mentioning friends or acquaintances who had been privileged enough to buy while those from lowincome backgrounds lost out ciara from a town in the southeast graduated three years ago into an unstable work environment where she struggled to find a job that wasnt an unpaid internship she now has one but is saddled with enormous student debt and still lives at home angry at the failure of politicians to support her generation my parents are hardcore conservatives who cant understand why i am so frustrated with this government who i believe are deliberately limiting social mobility for workingclass single people she says they blame a labour government who gave too much to too many while wondering why my younger sister who is exmilitary and i havent moved out i got pregnant accidentally two years ago my boyfriend and i desperately wanted a child but knew we had nowhere to live and no means to support it instead of living in fear of raising it in what could ultimately have been poverty in a society that refused to help support us we had no choice but to end the pregnancy ive been in grief counselling for a year to come to terms with that decision ciara is scared she wont ever get the chance to have a family my mother reminds me that at my age she had been married for five years and had me for four at i cant even imagine having a onebedroom flat to myself or a husband or the baby i so badly want im terrified that in the next five years ill still be no closer to that and thats the worry so many of us are fearful that even as we become older and perhaps gain a bit more stability at work or a leg up on to the property ladder bringing up children will still be all but impossible steve lives with his girlfriend in a house near cardiff that they were able to buy because of an inheritance but despite them both being selfemployed in marketing and earning a regular salary apiece he says that longterm planning is impossible neither of us have pensions sick pay holiday pay life insurance taking a summer break is nigh on impossible there is no way we could have kids despite both us of us wanting to no way wed lose one salary and even with welfare support we could not give a child the right kind of environment to thrive lets be honest you need to give way more than just love hiran tells of how his mother came to this country from east africa when she was she earned a week doing factory work by the time she was my age she had saved enough to get married have two children of secondary school age had bought her council house and mortgaged it to buy a shop in contrast hiran and his brother live at home both earning less than an hour if you are drowning in debt it closes the door on going to bars and nightclubs or spending money on hobbies that could lead to intimate relationships with no money to socialise were left playing computer games in our rooms we might as well be marriage kids mortgage no chance without our parents pension we couldnt eat as they get older their assets will have to be sold to pay for their care and then my brother and i are likely to face middle age dependent on the state some might argue that expectations are now simply too high thea certainly thinks so i come from a workingclass background so while i have had some financial help from my parents when ive been desperate im talking a couple of hundred quid a month the onus has always been on me to achieve and get where i want to be in life ive not had anything handed to me like a house or substantial amount of money that would help me settle down in future but it doesnt bother her too much my upbringing and background have helped me accept my current situation despite not having much money as a kid we never went abroad for example i never felt i missed out on anything i do think my expectations of what constitute necessities foreign holidays owning a house or car are lower than those of some of my peers who had more middleclass upbringings thea has never wanted children and as an only child knows that she will inherit her parents house when they die i think the country as far as wages property poverty and my generation actually being able to build secure finances is in an absolute state and something undoubtedly needs to be done but i also think part of the problem is that so many people go to uni now it devalues a degree i dont have one and doesnt guarantee anyone a job so youre left with broke unemployed twentysomethings in debt she has a point those of my friends who had children young and didnt go to university now have older children and are in a position where they can enter higher education or retrain but thats not to say its been easy they have struggled financially often as single parents more flexibility in education would help but as almost everyone i speak to says and jessica articulates the main thing the government needs to do is build more bloody houses its sad jessica adds because ive convinced myself i dont want a marriage mortgage or kids but i genuinely see them as impossible and thats probably why she does think moving to london has been a factor renting a room any bigger than about two metres wide in a flatshare is unattainable she feels she is being penalised for being ambitious as kirsten a yearold legalaid lawyer specialising in human rights says why shouldnt a professional woman in her s be able to afford to live in not the centre but even the very outskirts of our capital city she currently shares an overcrowded house with four others im an adult but am not able to live like an adult londons housing market has trapped me paying high rent that prevents me from saving anything towards a deposit for a flat it would be hard for me to move out of london and find a similar job and in any event i feel resentful at that suggestion besides to suggest that being somewhere cheaper solves the problem is simplistic chloe is and moved to london from the northeast a year ago due to a lack of jobs id like to have kids but dont really feel in a much better position to do so than i did when i was the one day seems to be stretching way in to my s and thats pretty concerning especially when theres so much talk about biological clocks my s have felt like a very extended teenage period in terms of financial circumstances rather than mindset i remain optimistic and resourceful and i dont have crazy expectations but i think that this might continue for a while yet in david willettss book the pinch how the baby boomers stole their childrens future he describes britain as the first nuclear power hes talking about the nuclear family something he argues is a longstanding feature of anglophone societies in contrast to countries on the continent where property is transmitted through larger familial networks because we are a nation made up of small families and focused on private property we need the state more because there is less to fall back on it follows that when the system fails or gets into difficulty the nuclear family suffers everyone i spoke to for this article felt a responsibility not to bring children into an environment that was economically precarious but i wonder how long people are willing to sacrifice future parenthood because of this if we all go ahead and have babies anyway what will be the consequences for the state its ironic that a government so ostensibly dedicated to notions of family is giving little help to those who desire nothing more communal living is already a reality for many people as overcrowded houses and boomerang children demonstrate do we all just need to learn to live with other peoples babies moving abroad is one solution as eleanor explains i honestly dont see a way that i will be able to raise children in the uk if i look at my peers from school and university most have left for australia and the us and i dont blame them they seem really happy elsewhere wages are lower but their standard of living is higher i would like to have children in the uk because my parents and my partners parents live here but it would be too much of a struggle and i cant afford to live near my family who might otherwise be able to help me if childcare was ever an issue i am barely able to make ends meet as things are its heartbreaking andrea agrees there are days i wish i could just take the babybrain out when i just feel so sad about it i dont know if its because ive lost my mum so dont really have that unconditional love with anyone any more but i just feel like my arms are empty she wont feel complete until she has a

victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable witnesses are being put at risk by the erratic handling of sensitive cases by police and prosecutors inspectors have said her majestys inspectorate of constabulary said it was concerned to find that the risks to vulnerable witnesses were not properly dealt with in a third of the cases it examined including instances of racial or homophobic abuse and domestic violence in one case police failed to consider the vulnerability of a woman and her yearold daughter who feared reprisals after being racially abused over a long period by their neighbour who had threatened to burn their house down hmic inspectors accused the police and prosecutors of failing to understand the nature of vulnerability as it ordered the crown prosecution service and national police chiefs council to improve their preparation of case files involving vulnerable victims and witnesses the nature of vulnerability in the context of a case progressing through the criminal justice system is not understood clearly by the police and prosecutors hmic inspectors said we consider that this is an opportune time to look in greater depth at the nature of vulnerability and identify what can be done to assist police and prosecutors to assess vulnerability in different contexts and provide the support that vulnerable victims and witnesses require inspectors examined a total of case files from across england and wales and identified cases that involved vulnerable or intimidated victims and witnesses most of these were recorded as being afraid or intimidated while a fifth were victims of domestic violence in of the cases the police failed to identify the vulnerability of a victim or witness and so did not put measures in place to manage this risk through the court process special measures that can be put in place include allowing vulnerable witnesses or victims to give evidence from behind a screen in court a practice often used by sexual assault victims to preserve their anonymity in cases the cps correctly identified the vulnerability of the victim or witness but failed to put in place any measures to protect them many of these cases involved victims and witnesses who were in fear of the defendant the inspectors said the police did this in of the cases examined in one of these cases a yearold woman with parkinsons disease was not assessed for special measures despite a request by the cps after she was robbed of her handbag the elderly victim said she felt especially vulnerable as she lived alone and the handbag contained her house keys in another case a woman and her two daughters told police they had been left traumatised after being attacked by a man with mental health problems while out walking despite this there was no record that any of the victims were considered vulnerable witnesses hmic inspector wendy williams said the quality of criminal case files is a subject that both hmic and hmcpsi hm crown prosecution service inspectorate have looked at a number of times in the past unfortunately we are still seeing the same mistakes being made with case files lacking the quality and consistency needed to ensure the best outcome for witnesses and victims although we found some improvements during this inspection the approach by police and prosecutors to preparing case files was still not good enough insufficient consideration was being given to the needs of vulnerable victims and witnesses there were cases where the risk was not initially identified by the cps but was realised later down the line a cps spokesman said victims and witnesses are at the heart of everything we do in the past two years we have set up a series of victim liaison units across england and wales to improve communications with victims and recently published the results of the first ever survey of more than victims and witnesses two thirds of victims and three quarters of witnesses reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the service they received from the cps there is always more that can be done to improve the service that we provide that is why we will be working with our police partners to examine the work of the joint witness care units across england and wales who manage most interactions between victims witnesses and prosecutors during the life of the case to see what improvements can be made,2015-11,victim domestic violence vulnerable witness put risk erratic handling sensitive case police prosecutor inspector said majesty inspectorate constabulary said wa concerned find risk

whenever a new study comes out about the time men and women spend on childcare or household duties we rarely hear anything that we dont already know both men and women want to spend more time with their kids everyone spends too much time at the office and women do demonstrably more of domestic work than men despite our social and political gains but heres something new and interesting men it seems despite doing less work than their female partners feel quite confident that theyre in equal relationships perhaps we need a new word a la mansplaining for this phenomenon manblindness chore goggles according to new research by the pew research center theres a significant gender gap in how mothers and fathers describe their households distribution of labor essentially pew found that whether or not a woman works outside of the home and no matter how many hours she works mothers report doing more household labor than their husbands fathers however are about more likely to say that their domestic chores are shared equally in the relationship why is there such a disconnect among men about how much theyre doing around the house perhaps a better question how can we get men to understand that theyre not doing nearly as much work as they think they are the answer may lay in the fact that women are much more likely to do mental labor more than half of the families that responded to pew noted that it was the mother who was in charge of childrens schedules and activities its easy to keep track of who does the vacuuming or washes the dishes the same isnt really true for who is keeping a running tally of when the toilet paper will run out or when to schedule the kids next dental cleaning given the disparity its not so shocking that while only of fathers said family chores make it difficult for them to advance their careers more than double the percentage of women said the same thing its more difficult to strategize about a promotion or a work project when you have a million other things who is picking up the kids today who needs new socks on your mind im glad to see were making such strides on closing the gap of tangible chores that parents can share thats a great thing its equally as promising that every year more and more men say they want to spend more time with their children and are interested in a better worklife balance just as women are it points to an important and necessary cultural shift but if we can make progress at splitting the chores we can certainly do better at making sure women are not the default parent who is managing the family and while its wonderful that men want to take more of a role in the domestic sphere they need to understand that participating in the workload doesnt mean theyre offering equal time and please spare me the argument that women prefer to do housework or care more about how certain things are done so men the next time you do the dishes remember to make note of whether you finished the

women to be challenged womens independence to be promoted gender stereotypes and roles to be challenged and positive equal and respectful relations between women and men to be strengthened an australia where women and their children live free from violence is an achievable longterm goal the framework says it can only be realised by addressing the drivers of this violence which are deeply entrenched in our culture society communities and daily lives an educational video will also been launched to complement the framework the minister for women michaelia cash is among the speakers who are scheduled to speak at the launch and said evidencebased guidance was essential for governments and agencies trying to address violence against women the framework helps us recognise and understand

the womens institute in england was born years ago not as some might expect in a kitchen or a parish hall but in the cosy back room of a pub in west sussex a milestone now marked by a small wooden plaque on the wall the fox goes free pub in charlton already had listed building status as a charming thcentury structure with original features including an ancient bread oven however on monday it will be relisted along with three other key sites in the history of the womens institute reflecting its role in their story the wi was founded in canada in and the british wing which now has branches and members began in anglesey wales in in response to the need to step up food production in the war but the first meeting in england was at the fox goes free on november that year the venue was presumably chosen because the innkeeper a mrs laishley was a founder member and the nearest village hall where the wi now meets in nearby singleton was then reserved for men only the culture minister lady nevillerolfe said the wi was an extraordinary social movement a much loved british institution as a farmers daughter i am very aware that the wi was formed during the first world war encouraging women to grow and preserve food balcombe place a victorian mansion in sussex which was the home of the first chairwoman lady gertrude denman from until her death in is also being relisted to recognise her decades in office she led the rapidly growing movement from until the present chair of the national federation of the wi janice langley said it was fantastic that historic england was joining the centenary celebrations through the listing of buildings that played important roles in the earliest days of the movement the other sites being relisted reflect the growing scale and wealth of the movement in the wi bought the imposing th century marcham park in oxfordshire to use as a residential training centre and renamed it denman college in honour of its recently retired chair denman is

its relatively easy to find the funny in something that breaks your heart frustration and rage are much trickier emotions to find the lols in how do you make something funny that fills you with such anger all arguments are reduced to frustrated inarticulate noises and finding the funny is important from world wars to the horrors of extremism laughter is a powerful way to reclaim the humanity of a horrible topic so i could write about the hundreds of women in ireland today forced by irelands abortion laws to make the lonely humiliating trip to a foreign country for a medical procedure illegal in their own i could rage about the agony of a woman forced to carry her doomed child to full term knowing she will never feel it breathing in her arms i could rant about a countrys leader casually dismissing any suggestion that a cruel constitutional clause that equates a mothers life to that of a foetus or embryo should at least be discussed but no one finds an angry woman funny or even likable for that matter so no one listens so instead i thought it would be better to take the irish state at its word if they want to control my body if they feel so comfortable interfering in what happens inside it they should at least have all the details so i decided to livetweet my menstrual cycle to the taoiseach enda kenny sure some could argue that its none of his business what happens inside my fallopian tubes but if we took that logic to its conclusion i wouldnt need to tweet him in the first place no if there is one thing the irish state has shown over the years it is that it does think this is its business it gets to decide what happens when im pregnant so why shouldnt it be involved during all the other stages too what about the daily grind of owning a vagina or irelands littlest embassy as i affectionately call it the daily discharges the cramps heavyflow versus lightflow tampons the itching tell me what to do enda tell me you and all the men in your government feel comfortable controlling so many aspects of my body at least tell me how to deal with pmt maybe they could form a committee to tell me whether i should try primrose oil i initially thought livetweeting enda my monthly cycle might be a thing i did for a week or so then one of my friends would quietly take me aside and gently suggest it was getting weird then a wonderful thing happened irish women all over the country and abroad found out about the idea and gloriously got involved they sent the leader of the country hilarious tweets verging from the mundane to the grotesque about their monthly visitor the women tweeting arent hysterical humourless harridans they are funny clever articulate women who are tired of men feeling entitled to control their bodies women are supposed to be ashamed of their bodies you see were gross when were not pregnant and were even ickier when we are if we cant even talk openly about our periods its no wonder that campaigning for further rights is so difficult enda kenny of course ignored the tweets but then he is used to ignoring women we are secondclass citizens in our own country i hope however he has got our message if not our tweets we are not ashamed we are not silent and we are not going away and to all the men collapsing like southern belles at our unladylike behaviour im sorry but your attitude is as pathetic old and irrelevant as the dusty tampon i keep finding in the bottom of my handbag it could take many years for irelands restrictive laws to be repealed in that time thousands more women face prosecution for making a decision about their own body hundreds more irish doctors will need to check the statute book before checking a pregnant womans temperature thousands more women will simply not be safe in hospital in their own country and one thing is certain women will die because of it possibly some of the same women who are tweeting enda kenny today if you didnt laugh youd cry,2015-11,relatively easy find funny

it is more taboo to be a domestic violence victim than to have aids according to the new south wales minister for the issue speaking at the domestic violence nsw conference the states first domestic violence minister pru goward did not promise any new money for programs but said new funding structures were being worked out by the government she said although the national conversation about domestic violence had become more prominent in recent years there was still much work to be done on getting people to recognise it was a gender equality issue a member of the audience spoke about working for a financial instituion and having her pro bono work for domestic violence causes taken off her bio for the website because it was a bit much we need this continuing public conversation about perpetrators who they are what they are to encourage business to think its ok to put that on their website goward said the fact is if you said you had aids it would be more acceptable than to say you are a victim of domestic violence and we need to change that goward said the conversation about domestic violence had changed in recent years because people no longer saw it as a poor people issue and the conversation about perpetrators needed to move with it perpetrators are forgotten she said goward said the motivations for perpetrators particularly their feeling of entitlement to power over their victim needed to be more widely acknowledged and said she could have kissed the state premier mike baird when he acknowledged it the other conversation we have to have is that domestic violence is a crime driven by attitudes to women and we must not back off when the premier said for the first time its about power oh god i could have kissed him she said fancy saying that sometimes i wonder if he knew what he said to him it was so obvious but i dont know whether he realised to many people listening it would have been no its not its about alcohol and its about women nagging their husbands all the stuff you read in those surveys so when he says that its about power i thought that is a gamechanger for men to have a male leader say that with that level of confidence and determination and we need to keep saying it we need to keep reminding people its about taking the credit card its about throwing your mobile away its about putting devices on it its about checking how many kilometres youve done on the car that day its about where you eat your meal compared with the rest of your family its about all those other signs that we dont talk about much goward signalled some future policy shifts endorsing a call for family law courts to be reformed she said the victims of domestic violence needed to be given more power in the court situation such as giving evidence via video link rather than have to sit in the same courtroom as their abusers she also said the government would likely be putting into place new structures which would give more funding but when asked for specifics she said ask gladys referring to the states treasurer gladys berejiklian goward recently launched the states m domestic violence strategy which is aimed at prevention and minimising reoffending she said one of the biggest challenges of he ministership had been making people understand that domestic violence is a gender equality issue australians by and large think that we do respect sheilas and its really all ok and its just these odd blokes who are either psychopathic or characterised as mentally ill or dysfunctional i suspect theres a huge group in the middle who are perfectly normal they just think it is ok she said the domestic violence nsw conference ran for two days and was used to launch a report revealing the high rates of domestic violence in lesbian

the papua new guinea government must step up to the plate and address the epidemic of family and sexual violence which is mainly being tackled by ngos and grassroots activists human rights watch has said among recommendations in a comprehensive new report released on wednesday the notforprofit organisation called for the png government to take immediate action and implement its twoyearold family protection legislation increase public awareness of family violence and ensure police fully investigate crimes and arrest perpetrators change was needed at all levels including courts human rights watch hrw also urged international donors and institutions to publicly and privately lobby for action by the government assist in policy development and expand frontline ngo and grassroots services in australia provided about of the m in development assistance for that year and has previously invested m in justice reform in the report based on interviews with women hrw said png was failing to meet its obligations under international law to protect women and girls from discrimination and family violence years after ratifying the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women the png government really needs to step up to the plate and put more resources in elaine pearson hrws australia director told guardian australia png is not an extremely poor country they have money there that could be used they just had the pacific games if they have money to build all these infrastructure and stadiums for a regional sporting event then surely they can set aside money in the budget to build safe houses victims and advocates face numerous obstacles including dependence on their spouse geographic isolation a lack of medical care and community support and the high cost of accessing it and poor police response while there has been progress in the sector with antiviolence awareness programs counselling hotlines medical care and safe houses family and sexual violence remains rife and largely unpunished papua new guinean woman jenella told hrw she had endured more than two decades of abuse at the hands of her husband she said the violence escalated after he took a second wife who also assaulted her the yearold mother of seven said she had gone to police times seeking intervention but had received no help i brought my husband to the police station and the police said you have so many kids you should go back and not do this again i wanted them to put him in jail for one or two years the report quotes jenella as saying among hrws recommendations is for the government to initiate comprehensive data gathering on family violence aside from interviewbased reports such as hrws the only comprehensive survey was published in it found family violence was occurring in more than two thirds of households but advocates and activists say it remains pervasive pearson said the organisation didnt have to search far to find women with similar stories to janellas about police nonresponsiveness part of it is certainly a lack of resources for police we often heard the excuse that there was not fuel to go in the car in order to get to villages where incidents took place pearson said but at same time theres a lack of orders coming from the top of the police force to prioritise these cases family violence has not been given priority despite the fact that a law was passed more than two years a go a lot of police in the highlands say they still have not received the charge sheet to prosecute family violence under the new law the hrw report says while travel to remote areas of the country can be challenging it is feasible the government should make it clear to police officers that they must travel wherever necessary to investigate crimes and arrest perpetrators the government also should ensure that police have sufficient resources to do so and prohibit police from demanding that crime victims and ngos pay them money for fuel and meals recent years have been tumultuous for the png government and particularly its police executive it has been dogged by corruption allegations scandals and an investigation which prompted an arrest warrant for the prime minister peter oneill several high ranking police officers commissioners and the attorneygeneral lost their jobs but pearson said this was not an excuse for the lack of enforcement at the station level where politics did not trickle down while it had been harder for police to deal with a range of issues family violence was the cases theyre seeing day to day we saw queues of women outside some stations waiting to be seen its no surprise that in some cases women just give up and think i cant see the police if i have to wait here for a full day so whats the point protection orders worked when they were issued pearson said but police officers were too heavily focusing on counselling and mediation instead of rescuing women from horrifically violent relationships within genderbased violence issues in png is the growing issue of sorceryrelated attacks monica paulus a png womens rights activist who works to rescue women who have been accused of sorcery said there was a key difference between the two forms of family violence paulus has worked in the sector for about years and was herself accused of sorcery by family members with my experience with sorceryrelated violence when its domestic violence you can also see support from family and community for the woman but when its a woman accused of sorcery she automatically loses the family and community support however paulus also pointed to parallels in the two issues the government had also stalled after enacting legislation against sorceryrelated violence failing to implement or enforce it there are the basics they should be providing so when you look at it theres not enough service providers and also with the networking of the services the safety net has not been created by the government she said nongovernment organisations civil society groups and community activists like paulus were filling the void left by an absence of government funding and conducting lifesaving work pearson said but theres all sorts of gaps whether legal aid counselling hotlines as well as shelters and safe houses she said one of the really key recommendations is that we think these organisations need more funding and certainly need that funding from the png government,2015-11,papua new guinea government must step plate address epidemic family sexual violence mainly tackled ngo grassroots

feminism is a numbers game and is one of our most hallowed benchmarks so the fact that one in four ftse board positions is now held by women represents real progress up from just one in eight five years ago but also shows just how far there is still to go to achieve gender equality at the top of british business this is particularly true given that most board positions held by women are nonexecutive its easier to appoint women to these oversight roles than fix the longerterm issue of the executive talent pipeline its these sort of metrics the proportion of women setting corporate strategy and the proportion making our laws against which the success of the feminist movement is often judged and with good reason no society can claim to be committed to gender equality if the dial isnt shifting in the right direction at the top but we shouldnt forget that as a set of benchmarks they tell a very partial tale of women in the workplace there is another group of women for whom over not underrepresentation is the problem twothirds of lowpaid jobs are done by women and women make up the bulk of the workforce in many lowpay lowskill sectors around in caring and domestic services for many of these women the reality of work is poor pay low levels of training few prospects for progression and job insecurity its thanks to feminism that were having this debate one of its biggest victories has been the redefinition of female identity away from what goes on behind closed doors in the home to the public sphere of the workplace a couple of generations ago few women regardless of class had jobs or careers today a womans identity is much more likely to be tied up in her professional life but women have benefited differentially the female executive who one day aspires to the city boardroom and the female cleaner she employs to clean her house represent different sides of the same story of female employment when women started to move into professional jobs they created a swath of new servicesector jobs for other women too often the debate about gender equality at work glosses over the fact that womens experiences of the workplace can be very different for the female exec work is likely to be a critical part of her identity on her mind may be worries about the extent to which the maledominated culture at her firm will make it harder to progress how much the six months she is planning on taking out to have her second child will set her back and how to juggle expensive childcare with her long hours for a cleaner working parttime and unsociable hours on a temporary minimumwage contract work is more likely to be a means to an end a way of boosting the household income to get by and support her children far from thinking about progression opportunities are virtually nonexistent with the agency she works for she worries about whether there will still be work when her contract comes to an end both of these womens experiences fall short but in different ways if you asked them what would make a real difference to their lives youd probably get quite different answers the gap between professional and unskilled women is much greater than that between professional and unskilled men professional women make more than unskilled women for men this gap is just improving the quality of jobs in lowincome insecure sectors such as care could vastly improve the lives of women working in them there is no doubt it would take real political will it would involve more training and better pay and the government by far the biggest customer of care services would therefore need to be prepared to pay more for them but this currently feels low down on the list of political priorities contrast this with the governments recent pledge to expand the amount of free childcare for three and fouryearolds from hours to hours a week who does best out of this in truth professional families stand to gain more than the low paid who could have claimed up to of childcare costs back under universal credit anyway and this expansion comes at a cost it is widely acknowledged to be seriously underfunded with the hourly rate that government pays providers for the free offer set too low in practice many childcare providers make the sums work by crosssubsidising governmentfunded hours from the hours for which they charge parents expanding the free offer means that will no longer be possible it is hard to see how the childcare workforce of whom are women wont suffer as a result of squeezed pay and less investment in training feminism has achieved its most momentous victories when the movement has found causes that unite the interests of all women winning the vote winning the right to work but now these have been won have our interests started to diverge feminists can continue to try to find the causes that unite all women such as getting women on banknotes or getting rid of the vat on sanitary products these are not insignificant issues but compared to some of the other challenges facing women they perhaps feel a little lowest common denominator can we honestly say they are the things that are going to have the most material impact on womens lives and if not should we be prioritising them given there is limited time for parliamentary debate and a limited number of column inches feminisms battles are far from over not just because only one in four ftse board positions is held by a woman but because working conditions in lowpaid sectors dominated by women leave so much to be desired but given the heterogeneity of womens

in january feminists memorably kicked off the new year with excellent responses to a magazine tweet asking what diet will you be on in replies included im on the resisting ongoing pressure from the media to be skinny diet the why the fuck would i be on a diet diet and my personal favourite cake wine and unabashed body positivity to start in a similarly feminist fashion why not consider adopting one or two feminist new years resolutions its true that no one person can create a feminist utopia overnight but if we each took a few simple actions to challenge sexism in our own small sphere together we could make a very big difference indeed here are a few ideas to get you started celebrate female writers was declared the year of reading women in a conscious effort to offset a bias that sees far more books by male than female authors reviewed in major literary publications but combatting generations of inequality in the literary canon is an ongoing struggle so try doing your own bookshelf audit this year and take inspiration from the readwomen hashtag the womenwriters twitter account and pioneering femalefocused publisher persephone and artists why limit yourself to literature theres plenty of imbalance to be offset elsewhere too when the east london fawcett group audited commercial london galleries in they found that only of the represented artists were women so take special notice of exhibitions such as the scottish national gallery of modern arts modern scottish women which will highlight the work of scottish female painters and sculptors until june or see the work of feminist artist margaret harrison in the exhibition accumulations at middlesbrough institute of modern art until january for further inspiration check out the society of women artists and the association of women art dealers volunteer or donate to your local refuge or rape crisis centre in it was reported that one donkey sanctuary received more public donations than three national domestic abuse services combined now i have nothing against donkeys but maybe we could redress the balance a little by supporting our austeritystricken rape and domestic violence charities too this applies especially to black and minority womens specialist services which have been particularly hard hit by recent cuts take a leaf out of bradley coopers book share your salary details with coworkers after it was revealed that jennifer lawrence was paid less than her male colleagues in the film american hustle her regular onscreen partner bradley cooper declared his intention to start sharing salary information with female costars during the negotiating process to help beat the gender pay gap but even outside of hollywood this kind of conversation among colleagues is a practical way to start exposing wage disparity and a simple way to arm women with the information they need to ask for a raise watch films that pass the bechdel test the test created by american cartoonist alison bechdel simply requires a film to have two named female characters who have a conversation together that isnt about a man yet a staggering number of movies fail to pass it only watching bechdelapproved films in might be difficult in practice especially without detailed prior knowledge of each film but at least try to up your bechdel count by looking out for movies with diverse casts you can also raise your womeninfilm quotient by keeping up with the london feminist film festival get better at talking to young people make it your resolution to speak to children in a way that doesnt reinforce gender stereotypes for example try to find other ways to compliment girls without automatically focusing on their appearance use your role as an auntie uncle godparent or grandparent as an opportunity to source genderneutral gifts dont be afraid to give a boy a doll or a girl a mechanics set the let toys be toys campaign has a list of recommended retailers something else to think about for the new year is talking to young people about the importance of consent until campaigns for consent to be included on the national curriculum are successful the only way to guarantee young people grow up with an awareness of their sexual rights and responsibilities is to talk to them openly about what a healthy relationship looks like we need to have this conversation with children of all genders and it should focus on teaching all parties to gain enthusiastic consent not telling girls its their job to say no whether you decide to attempt one or more of the above or simply resolve to challenge sexism in the workplace or call out street harassment you can be part of the fight against gender inequality this year instead of throwing your hands up in despair at the scale of the problem roll up your sleeves and get stuck in,2015-12,january feminist memorably kicked new year excellent response magazine tweet asking diet reply included im resisting ongoing pressure medium

the power that feminism currently wields has been described as a moment or a trend but its much more than that the last years of feminist work have paved the way for a feminism thats deeply resonant and embedded in the culture and its not going anywhere anytime soon and no matter how you cut it gender justice has been at the forefront of the national conversation and a lot of peoples minds this past year some was good celebrities spoke up against sexism the military ended the ban on women in combat battling sexual assault took center stage and companies from netflix to spotify created realistic and generous parental leave policies some of it was bad a woman was arrested after desperately trying to end her pregnancy with a coat hanger a planned parenthood was the target of a terrorist shooting and no matter a womans accomplishments we were reminded that there is always someone ready to insult her with sexism or racism and some of it was a bit of both like when cecile richards was forced to testify in front of a house committee but she made them all look ridiculous some people were even outraged when ghostbusters was remade with an allfemale cast but that didnt stop anything feminisms prominence is even one reason that hillary clintons presidential campaign looks very different and is being responded to very differently in than in clinton isnt shying away from taking on gender explicitly any more and the sexism lobbed at her isnt being tolerated in the same way because since weve seen feminism get even more of a foothold in our broader culture rebecca traister calls this political and cultural shift the death of white male power those opposed to progress on race gender and lgbt issues are not participating in a fullblown cultural freakout because feminism is having a moment theyre afraid because they know their world is changing in a way that they can no longer control part of feminisms growing influence has to do with technology before the internet if a woman was interested in feminism she had to seek it out by finding an organization with which to become involved subscribing to ms magazine or taking a womens studies class as feminism has become more entrenched online first through blogs now through social media more people have gained access to activism information and community now women stumble across feminism while theyre on tumblr or facebook reading about everything from politics to pop culture and have the ability to learn more in just a few clicks the intersection of feminism and technology has also meant that sexist politicians cant slide under the radar the way they used to in a preinternet age we would never have seen the national outrage that spread after todd akin said in a local interview that women who are raped dont get pregnant or the widespread action after komen for the cure ended their planned parenthood funding technology has also helped democratize the feminist movement itself the center of feminist organizing and power used to reside mostly within large organizations and wellfunded ventures now the most successful campaigns and most progressive thinking are those sparked by individuals feminist hashtags slutwalks videos and memes all have pushed the movement into the future brought newer younger and more racially and economically diverse voices that had always been part of the movement to the forefront where they belong and made getting involved even more accessible if theres still any doubt that feminisms power is a lasting one consider the panicked backlash weve been witnessing these past few years as throngs of mostly white male pundits bemoan pc and victimhood culture they continue to be the demographic most likely to overreact when faced with changes they dont like if feminism wasnt at its most powerful there wouldnt be this kind of frenzied response to it so though we may continue to see more bad news in the days ahead like further moves to defund planned parenthood or the continued dismissal of rape victims we can hold on to the fact that we are winning not just for the moment but for the foreseeable future,2015-12,power feminism currently wields ha

coercive or controlling domestic abuse becomes a crime punishable by up to five years in prison from tuesday even if it stops short of physical violence the crown prosecution services new powers have been introduced as citizens advice reports a steep rise in the number of victims seeking help over the past year the charity said it had supported more than people suffering from domestic abuse in the months to october including cases of emotional abuse and of financial abuse the new legislation will enable the cps to bring charges where there is evidence of repeated or continuous controlling or coercive behaviour within an intimate or family relationship the cps said abuse can include a pattern of threats humiliation and intimidation or behaviour such as stopping a partner socialising controlling their social media accounts surveillance through apps or dictating what they wear controlling or coercive behaviour is defined under section of the serious crime act as causing someone to fear that violence will be used against them on at least two occasions or generating serious alarm or distress that has a substantial effect on their usual daytoday activities the new law is likely to generate complex challenges over precisely what constitutes criminal behaviour the director of public prosecutions alison saunders said controlling or coercive behaviour can limit victims basic human rights such as their freedom of movement and their independence this behaviour can be incredibly harmful in an abusive relationship where one person holds more power than the other even if on the face of it this behaviour might seem playful innocuous or loving victims can be frightened of the repercussions of not abiding by someone elses rules often they fear that violence will be used against them or suffer from extreme psychological and emotional abuse being subjected to repeated humiliation intimidation or subordination can be as harmful as physical abuse with many victims stating that trauma from psychological abuse had a more lasting impact than physical abuse cases can be heard in magistrates or crown courts and the maximum sentence is five years imprisonment evidence can include emails gps tracking devices installed on mobile phones bank records witness statements from family and friends and evidence of isolation polly neate the chief executive of womens aid said coercive control is at the heart of domestic abuse perpetrators will usually start abusing their victim by limiting her personal freedoms monitoring her every move and stripping away her control of her life physical violence often comes later womens aid and other organisations campaigned to have this recognised in law and we are thrilled that this has now happened it is a landmark moment in the uks approach to domestic abuse and must be accompanied by comprehensive professional training and awareness raising among the public louisa rolfe the temporary deputy chief constable of avon and somerset police and the national police lead on domestic abuse said we have seen a substantial increase in reporting nationally with greater understanding of all forms of abuse not just physical violence the new domestic abuse offence is another tool to help the police service and cps prosecute perpetrators of domestic abuse and protect victims it will provide more opportunities to evidence other forms of domestic abuse beyond physical violence not only will this encourage more victims to report we hope but also the concerned family and friends of victims the college of policings head of crime and criminal justice david tucker said the new offence of coercive control presents challenges it demands much fuller understanding of events that led up to a call for assistance and this can make evidence gathering more complex however more importantly it delivers greater opportunities to safeguard victims and achieve successful prosecutions according to citizens advice people sought help for domestic abuse between july and september a rise of on the same period in the previous year gillian guy the organisations chief executive said perpetrators are using coercive control to trap victims in abusive relationships more and more people are coming to citizens advice because they are experiencing abuse by a partner or loved one including restrictions on accessing their own money forcing them to take on debts and spying on them online the governments change in the law making coercive control a criminal offence is an important step forward in protecting victims of domestic abuse and helping them find a way out it is also important that the government continues to consider whether victims of all forms of abuse are able to get the support they need including through the justice system and legal aid figures from her majestys inspectorate of constabulary show the number of domestic abuse cases reported to the police in england and wales rose by between and,2015-12,coercive controlling domestic

the new film suffragette released in australia on boxing day begins with female activists smashing london shop windows and bombing the partially completed home of the chancellor of the exchequer it dramatises the militant actions of feminists from until the outbreak of the first world war as they sought the right for british women to vote edwardian women appear genteel in photographs but the tactics of the suffragettes transgressed feminine expectations of the era suffragettes disrupted debate in parliament and struggled with police in violent marches one famously slashed a painting of a naked woman in the national gallery and another even came at winston churchill on a train platform with a riding whip with england more than a decade behind new zealand which had granted womens suffrage in it was clear that polite and reasoned requests for womens political rights had not worked emmeline pankhurst leader of the suffrage movement explained that unruly activism was essential if the general public were pleased with what we are doing that would be a proof that our warfare is ineffective we dont intend that you should be pleased despite the sustained campaign full suffrage for women was not achieved until more than a century on from the british suffrage campaign the message that being pleasing is not the optimal route to political and social change remains just as pertinent increasingly men are informing feminists that they would be more successful if they made their politics more palatable the uns heforshe campaign launched by the unthreatening emma watson is often heralded as a positive way to involve men in work toward gender equality both the idea that feminism needs to be appealing to men and that men should be central to its progress are antifeminist ideas in themselves regardless of their approach feminists have always been characterised unfavourably for their social goals looks and refusal to defer to men mocking cartoons of suffragettes showed them beating men to the ground with umbrellas or standing over their husbands and forcing them to clean the house these caricatures took issue with the way that womens demands for the vote seemed to be upending the natural order in which men were physically dominant and women were best suited to domestic work others lampooned the unattractiveness of suffragettes they were drawn as old dowdy and either lacking in teeth or suffering from pronounced overbites though the goals of feminists have evolved with increasing rights for women the ideas at the core of antifeminist debate remain consistent conforming to pleasing behaviour for women means they must stay inside the accepted bounds of femininity that are bundled with the very inequalities that feminists wish to transform earlier in december saudi arabian women obtained the right to vote and stand in municipal elections there are many brave saudi women challenging repressive and discriminatory laws however the country is a prime example of how slow change is when conformity to a malecontrolled set of expectations is strictly enforced and the potential for equal rights depends solely on the benevolence of the group who holds power though women were elected to positions on one of local councils women comprised fewer than of the total number of voters the complex reasons for this disparity included far fewer voter registration centres for women these are sexsegregated and difficulty in supplying proof of residence for registration as men usually own family homes and pay bills female candidates for election were impaired by the prohibition on women driving cars and bans placed on campaigning to members of the opposite sex the women of saudi arabia are required to be pleasing in their activism given that they must obtain permission from men to hold a job travel or get married radical tactics like those of the british suffragettes would be impossible and measured methods have already transformed womens literacy and participation in higher education within a western context where the ability to vote is now around a century old in a number of countries it is regressive to be told that feminist views must be marketable to men and that men must be at the forefront of feminism the gender war that pankhurst described now includes a far greater number of supportive male allies nevertheless men should never be in command of the battle nor should women need their enemy to welcome the loss of power that will accompany their defeat,2015-12,new film suffragette released australia boxing day begin

a new domestic violence law comes into effect on december which recognises for the first time that abuse is a complex and sustained pattern of behaviour intended to create fear the coercive control offence which carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a fine can be invoked if a victim suffers serious alarm or distress that impacts on their daytoday activities or if they fear violence will be used on at least two occasions the law change comes in the same month as a report by the police inspectorate which found that the number of reported crimes associated with domestic abuse increased by in months her majestys inspectorate of constabulary hmic warned that specialist crime units could be overwhelmed and called for an end to the postcode lottery where protection and support for victims vary widely across the country it also noted inconsistent levels of awareness concerning coercive or controlling behaviour its only right that hmic is pushing the police to improve and that criminal procedures are strengthened but there is no equivalent action in the civil court system the family court system which deals with matters of finance child access and residence in cases where partners have been domestically abused needs to ensure a rigorous and consistent approach and at present the family court experience can prove devastating for vulnerable women and children government guidance concerning the new domestic violence offence says perpetrators can be particularly adept at manipulating professionals agencies and systems and may use a range of tactics in relation to this offence so where is the push for courts to train legal professionals to help them spot the psychological games and deceptions practised by abusive men and where are the checks and balances to ensure that rulings reflect an understanding that domestic violence is a sustained pattern of behaviour which has farreaching consequences in my experience and that of women i know who have been through the family court system the approach of judges and magistrates seems random theres a sense that anything can happen in these private hearings it depends which judge you get on the day is a common refrain we women can be forced into accepting mediation sessions with men who frighten us we can be bullied into shared care arrangements that do not meet the needs of our children and have been kept impoverished because our cunning expartners hide their finances from the courts safe in the knowledge that they will never be punished for their deceit often the court process is used as an additional threat by perpetrators and abuse can continue when legal professionals are hoodwinked into becoming pawns in a game aimed at destroying our lives thanks to my ex and the family court which failed to see through his lies i am homeless with our young child this christmas in my latest court expedition my ex invented the idea that i was obstructing the sale of our marital home and previously i was cornered into accepting a child arrangement order that exposes our child to his anger outbursts and controlling behaviour for large periods of time a sweettalking man in a suit who enlists the most successful barrister in town holds remarkable sway ive learned a friend of mine was dragged in and out of court for years by her abusive ex who successfully claimed that he was poverty stricken after putting his business and assets in the names of other family members he also charmed a children and family court advisory and support service officer who wrote a report in his favour suggesting that my friend had mental health problems another friend was accused of child negligence when her violent exhusband produced photographs to court of her looking worse for wear on a rare night out despite his habit of hitting their child he gained a shared care arrangement on the basis that she regularly got drunk there are further reports of women who are so frightened by their experience of the family court that they return to live with violent partners the potential for dodgy court rulings was increased by the removal of legal aid for most family law cases in april legal aid is now only offered to those domestic victims who meet particular criteria such as going to a refuge or involving the police some of us simply dont possess the required forms of evidence abusive men have many years of experience conning and convincing not only their victims but friends family teachers childcare workers and health professionals for such an abusive person the family court

victims of domestic violence will discuss their abuse facetoface with the perpetrators under a scheme being piloted by a local authority that aims to break the cycle harrow council in northwest london which has funded the scheme to the tune of hopes that by providing specialist counselling sessions for couples who are violent towards each other future incidents can be reduced the council which has just begun counselling sessions with the first couple participating in the scheme believes it can tackle domestic violence by bringing couples together in a supportive environment to discuss its impact traditional models of tackling domestic violence usually focus on the abuser and not the whole family the harrow experiment is based on a us model social workers from harrow will undertake direct work with the children of families involved to assess the impact of the violence the programme will be run by psychotherapists and counsellors from the tavistock centre for couple relationships who will work with the families to find the triggers for the abuse susanna abse the centres chief executive said we are really delighted to be delivering in partnership with harrow council such a new and innovative way of helping with the major challenges faced when interpersonal violence occurs between couples councillor pamela fitzpatrick whose responsibilities include adult safeguarding and preventing domestic violence said the council was hopeful the scheme would help it to address the issue head on if the abusers understand the impact their behaviour has on their family we hope they can change we are delighted we are the first place to tackle the causes of domestic abuse she added that the initiative would coincide with a campaign encouraging victims of domestic violence to come forward victims are sometimes too scared to come forward and report it or dont know how to the scheme has been greeted with scepticism by some womens groups sarah green acting director of the end violence against women coalition said the assumption in such couple counselling approaches tends to be that both parties must be at fault and they simply need to learn better behaviours domestic violence is about bullying and control not misunderstanding it is a choice and it is deeply related to power between men and women karen ingala smith chief executive of nia a londonbased charity that works with vulnerable women and girls said the scheme should concentrate on challenging male violence rather than involving the family by framing this work as a family issue not as a male violence

how will we know when true gender equality is achieved in the british workplace perhaps there is an index running even now which measures gender equality with a range of key indicators equal pay at all levels of service delivery in the public sector would surely be one as would equal numbers of women achieving promotions at work or being employed in positions appropriate to their qualifications skills and training parity of representation in company boardrooms and among the nations chief executive officers would surely be another important indicator that years after the sex discrimination act this country is serious about treating women fairly and equally in the workplace last week in a perverse way the labour mp helen goodman provided another measure of the progress that has been made by working women in the uk goodman the mp for bishop auckland in northeast england suggested that women are now routinely promoted to top jobs in whitehall that were beyond their competence and level of experience goodman said someone very senior in the foreign office was saying that they were under pressure to appoint women as ambassadors you can find that people are perfectly capable but sometimes they lack the experience or skills that you need to have and you are not doing the organisation or the women themselves any favours by appointing them if this is true then it would be a landmark day in the quest for women to be treated equally in the workplace that there may be some women operating at the highest level of the uk government who are not up to the job and have only been appointed because of their gender ought to be a cause for some celebration for hundreds of years the governments of this country and the biggest boardrooms have been awarding the best and most financially lucrative jobs to incompetent men all over the uk today there are tens of thousands of male executives and senior civil servants who were only appointed to their jobs because of one or a combination of the following three attributes they are members of the right golf club they are freemasons they attended the right sort of school the cost to british industry going back generations because of this army of chinless wonders is probably beyond calculation in the banking sector an army of men brought this country to the brink of economic collapse because of a combination of greed arrogance and rank incompetence as well as the toxic bundles of mortgages that these men were trading in how many were handing out billions in loans to decent chaps who had given them hand relief in englands green and pleasant boarding schools and when the roof fell in on their scams and stratagems another army of incompetents was there to bail them out with billions of our money goodman a former member of gordon browns labour government as work and pensions minister was questioning city regulators about the collapse of halifax bank of scotland she seemed to be suggesting that a panicked desire to achieve gender balance in the banking industry had led to women being appointed who did not have the depth of experience required perhaps so yet the fingerprints found at the scenes of the uks biggest ever financial crime all belonged to men thus far these men have all escaped justice and have all been handsomely rewarded for their failure and guess what many have found highly paid senior positions in other positions that to a greater or lesser extent involve handling the publics money just the other week alistair darling one of those who awarded them billions to recover celebrated his elevation to the upper house by accepting a seat on the board of morgan stanley having fought to keep scotland in the uk the new baron darling of roulanish now finds that some are indeed better off together if there were any women in senior positions in the banking industry who were not deemed to be up to the job its doubtful that they would have been allowed to be members of those establishments and country clubs where some of the profligate deals were completed and they could not have inflicted any more damage on britain than their incompetent male colleagues did goodmans theory about women being appointed to jobs beyond their ability carries echoes of the s about it the statistics tell a different story around of civil service workers are female yet women hold just over a third of senior posts and less than onefifth of them are permanent secretaries discrimination against women in the civil service is just part of the pattern of privilege that our selfappointed elites have fought to embed in the culture of the uk it is one of the great ironies of the british right that they use efficiency and costeffectiveness to justify paying people as little as they can get away with and yet promote hopelessly unqualified and unsuitable people mainly men to the big and important jobs in any area of british industry politics and culture you care to look wellqualified women of proved ability are still being paid less than their male colleagues for doing the same job if you think there are far more iniquitous injustices to concern us then think again this culture insinuates itself into behaviours handed down from fathers to sons and mothers to daughters it suggests if you are a male that it is normal to look upon women as something less than you and if you are a young talented woman it discourages ambition and the idea that you can strive to be the best in scotland women such as nicola sturgeon kezia dugdale and ruth davidson have shown that being female and not having had the assistance of a private school doesnt stop you being all that you can be they all achieved success against the odds in a maledominated sector their continued success will be judged partly on how many other women they can emancipate in britains factories and offices,2015-12,know true gender equality achieved british workplace perhaps index running even

scotland now has more female than male solicitors for the first time after a sharp increase in the number of women qualifying as lawyers the law society of scotland lss said that of the more than practising solicitors are now women with most employed as inhouse lawyers for private and public sector organisations rather than in private practice the society said the trend which is being followed in england and wales where of solicitors are now women would continue and spread to higher reaches of the industry as older male lawyers retired women are still underrepresented at senior roles particularly in private firms in england and wales only of partners the senior figures who often run law firms are women nearly twothirds of practising lawyers in scotland under were now women compared with only of those over while of those admitted to the legal profession this year were women the society later confirmed that there was also significant underrepresentation of women working as solicitoradvocates a class of specialist courtroom lawyer able to lead on cases in all scottish courts without having the full qualifications or status as advocates the scottish version of the barrister it said only of scotlands solicitor advocates are women a figure that mirrors the minority of women working as advocates of the total and the small minority serving as judges there are only women working as advocates who represent clients in the higher courts out of people who are members of the faculty of advocates of scotlands queens counsel the most senior and highest paid rank of advocate only are female there are only nine female judges in scotland out of judges in post and no woman has served in the most senior posts of lord president or lord justice clerk there are only female sheriffs out of in post with only two out of six sheriff principals women the most senior female judge is lady smith who is president of scottish tribunals which adjudicate in areas such as mental health law or private rental housing christine mclintock president of the lss said private legal firms had to address the relative male domination of senior posts which could take years to change through natural wastage they needed to consider flexible working particularly in the most challenging competitive parts of the industry what is clear is that employers have to take notice of the increasing numbers of young ambitious women choosing to enter the legal profession and plan accordingly to avoid losing talented individuals from their business mclintock said i have no doubt that we will continue to see women in the profession rise to the top but given the results of our own and others research its likely to be many years before we see any kind of equality in terms of the numbers of women in the most senior roles but the new figures also raised questions about why fewer men than before saw law as a good career she added its important that we understand the changing profile of the legal profession which includes looking at the reasons why more woman are choosing a career in law and why men currently appear to be less attracted to joining the legal profession to ensure we can encourage and support best practice at all stages of a solicitors career sources from the legal profession say the problem with underrepresentation of women among advocates is a question for the wider legal community unlike the law society or judiciary where a ruling body can change policies recruitment strategies or training procedures to address inequalities advocates are selfemployed and independent the faculty of advocates does not have the same powers or central authority as the lss or judicial office for scotland to influence or control recruitment policy james wolffe qc dean of the faculty of advocates said he was pleased to see the latest lss statistics since most advocates began work as solicitors the faculty was committed to equality of opportunity he said more women are practising advocacy than ever before and with the changing demographic in the solicitors profession i expect that trend to continue he added,2015-12,scotland ha female male

ellen pao was at the heart of two of s biggest feminist news stories her discrimination lawsuit against former employer kleiner perkins and her resignation from contentsharing site reddit after weathering what she later called one of the largest trolling attacks in history death and rape threats racist abuse libel her home address publicised online from reddit users unhappy with paos efforts to crack down on hate speech and revenge porn pao could have lain low in both jobs instead she became a gamechanging force in taking on racism and sexism in very public ways that actually made an ideological dent she made the daytoday internet the executive offices of silicon valley finance and the broad swath of life in between incrementally more hospitable for women i sat down with pao in san francisco to talk about the toxic underbelly of the internet how we can fix it and what might be next after her wellearned time off how did the harassment affect you its interesting i was talking to somebody the other day who was saying how many times do people have to share their horrific experiences of harassment for people to believe that it happens and so here i am sharing this terrible time in my life and people care because its interesting and its horrific but then nothing really happens like how many times does this have to happen and again mostly to women it was at the point where we had security for our building i had security for my home and i had a lot of fear that something would happen to me or my family how can the internet be a better place for women if you talk to people who built communities early on such as the folks from second life the view is that its really hard to change a community later to fix it so if you allow some bad behaviour because you dont have the resources if you dont prioritise it it makes it hard to go back because the bad behaviour scales as your system and your community scale you need times as many people and it has become times more sophisticated and its groups of people working to troll your whole system do you think trolls attack you because they think its a game and they dont think of you as a human being or because they genuinely enjoy inflicting pain i have no idea i dont understand them its just not something that i would ever do why would you want to hurt a stranger it makes no sense to me so i just dont know its just a baffling part of the human psyche that i dont feel competent in trying to unravel and to be honest i just dont care to spend the time doing that theres no answer do you think the fight against discrimination is going to become a part of your professional life its very hard to spend of your time on it because its of your emotional energy ive found its a part of who i am and there are things that i was able to do at reddit as ceo that werent about fighting discrimination per se but just creating a fair environment like lets make sure that our pay is fair across the whole company and that helps everybody across the board not just women and minorities but also men who cant negotiate or managers who are bad negotiators whose teams arent happy because theyre not being paid the same amount thats something that i think i want to carry forward in everything that i do but i dont see it as im going to go out and talk and write and have that be my whole career why do you think people see your working towards basic fairness as an attack on them i think theres a lot of fear in change for some people it is the system has worked for me so whats wrong with it there cant be anything wrong with it theres an aspiration that people have that they are fair and unbiased and meritocratic and when you start pointing out these differences theres this huge gap between who they aspire to be and who they really are and what theyre doing its extremely uncomfortable fearinducing and disappointing to them so i think they cant acknowledge that gap they have to push to make sure that the people criticising it are the problem after your experience do you still feel as if reddit is a net gain for the world do you feel positively about the community as a whole there are so many good things that come out of reddit and i want to say that i think its the most awesome product in the universe but its not its like the rest of the internet where there are these really dark pockets my hope is that that team is able to clear out a lot of the toxicity and make it into a more positive place and a better experience for everyone and that it teaches people about a better internet and a better way to interact with people both online and in real life but thats a hard ask what do you see as the future of the internet i dont know theres a future that i want for it and thats the one i focus on it would be more like the early internet when it was really just about sharing information and people were helpful to each other and it was really just an awesome place to roam around what is the biggest problem facing the american tech industry i think the biggest issues with discrimination in the us tech industry are the lack of women and the lack of minorities in the workplace which generate a problem with how they are treated how do you get through to people who arent convinced there is a problem i think its going to take people telling their stories to get there and people sharing data because its not something thats going to be easy to convince people and its going to take calling people out like hey do you realise that you just asked that woman to go get coffee for us and is there a reason why you picked her or did you realise that you gave everybody credit for the project except for the africanamerican guy who spent all of his time on it for the past three weeks its not something thats a light switch that we can turn on for everybody in the same way but just having people feel comfortable talking about it and the research that universities are doing to show that this is happening in performance reviews this is happening in hiring this is happening in promotions i think the younger generation is going to grow up with a different set of baseline facts whats next for you i want to work at a company probably a startup with friends i havent really thought about it that much but i do want to get back to doing stuff and building things and making a difference that

cornered by lecherous coworkers with wandering hands told loudly by a senior colleague that youre too hot to be part of the technical team proclaimed winner of the best arse award asked shall we just shag four times despite the advances clearly being unwelcome offered a colleague a lift home only to be sexually assaulted in the back of a taxi alongside the obvious connections these experiences have one thing in common that might surprise you they all happened to women attending work christmas parties around this time of year the everyday sexism project sees an upsetting spike in stories from working women who have experienced sexism harassment and even assault at annual company festivities the stories are varied and complex in some cases women are excluded from the party altogether missing out on networking opportunities and sidelined from the team im a female working in the construction industry currently i and one other female work here and neither of us are invited to the christmas party ive worked here for four years and ive never been invited in my first year i was invited and then uninvited because it might be awkward weve kicked up a bit a fuss this year but my boss will not let us come because it has been this way for years many examples such as being sexually propositioned by married colleagues assume an atmosphere of conspiratorial naughtiness at such events some reports amount to sexual assault my bosss boss a married man made several attempts to molest me at a christmas party including grabbing my breasts pulling me towards him slapping my bottom and trying to force unwanted kisses on me exasperated i eventually told him to fuck off then spent an anxious weekend worrying that i would lose my job fortunately i didnt but he continued pestering me everyone thought it was funny and that i should be flattered others demonstrate how a culture of complicity and normalisation can prevent perpetrators from facing any ramifications one of the men in my office chased one of the women into a room at the christmas party and wouldnt let her leave until she kissed him everyone knows he did it hes still considered a nice guy the common responses why didnt she kick up a fuss and id have kicked him where it hurts are understandable but they completely fail to take in to account the power dynamic inherent in many such cases while some argue that this is no big deal the longterm impact is often much greater than one might realise while working for a law firm and attending the christmas party one of the male partners told me that my dress was pretty but would look better crumpled on his bedroom floor he kept asking to walk me home even though he was married and i was living with my boyfriend at the time i felt quite frightened of him and left the party swiftly when he wasnt looking so i could get home without the fear of being pursued i complained to my boss who of course had a word with him but he continued to make my working life intolerable so i left for many women who experience a surge of workplace harassment in environments such as restaurants and bars im dressed as santa sit on my lap have you been naughty or nice give us a christmas kiss there isnt necessarily an hr department to notify nor a means of complaining without jeopardising what might already be an uncontracted and lowpaid position for those dependent on tips with the directive to keep customers happy handling harassment becomes even more difficult for those who feel able to protest and might be strengthened by factual ammunition its important to know that the equality act protects people from harassment by their employer and their colleagues this includes unwanted or unwelcome behaviour that violates their dignity or creates an intimidating hostile degrading humiliating or offensive atmosphere and yes this applies to workrelated social events such as office christmas parties if you feel able to do so you have every right to complain and your employer should take the problem seriously but the only way to solve this problem for all workers not just those who are in a strong enough position to protest is to demand that workplaces tackle the issue at the source this is not as difficult as some make out if we expect employers to protect employees from sexual harassment in the workplace they should maintain the same basic standards at festive events indeed according to the law they must many elements of the problem inviting only male employees holding the party in a strip club giving out inappropriate rewards are within the organisers control others such as inappropriate behaviour should be tackled with clear zerotolerance policies and transparent protected reporting procedures its a red herring to suggest as many people do that cracking down on sexual harassment will create an awkward atmosphere or take the fun out of the office christmas party being the target of sexist jokes or groping on the dancefloor is what

research from the chartered management institute has revealed the negative longterm effect for women who take maternity leave termed the motherhood penalty based on women in fulltime management and professional positions the problems include a pay gap that widens considerably as the woman gets older the research also highlighted a softer type of discrimination with mothers being placed into less demanding or parttime roles all this despite antidiscrimination laws and the introduction in april of shared parental leave that subject to conditions offered parents the opportunity of sharing between them up to weeks leave on statutory pay the hope was that this would lead to a new dawn in childcare gender equality similar to countries such as sweden at the time there were concerns that the new legislation was too complicated and didnt go far enough the swedish model is more generous financially another major concern was the social stigma still attached to any kind of paternity leave while its too soon to gauge the full picture with spl men have been notoriously reluctant to take up paternity leave one survey in reported that up to of fathers chose to take no time off at all never mind extended options why is this happening why do so many fathers worry that they would be stigmatised and penalised if they stayed home with their children short answer men are not stupid or blind theyve seen what has happened and crucially what is still happening to mothers in the workplace the blatant and covert antimother bias is there for all to see and men dont want it to happen to them of course family finances would play a large part in these decisions and perhaps some women wouldnt want more leave either for them or their partner however there remains this fundamental problem with childcare equality in the workplace many men just wouldnt want it because theyre scared it would screw up their careers you cant even blame it on machismo an im not changing bloody nappies attitude instead this smells of fear an anxiety that overrides any faith in socalled legal rights or what could be genuine enthusiasm to stay home with their kids a widespread male conviction that their families would be better off if they stuck rigidly to the traditional career path so entrenched and toxic are these problems and attitudes that its difficult to know where to start especially considering that discriminatory laws are already in place but are flouted even today a childless woman could get all the right answers from companies in job interviews about their policies but when the children arrive these softer more nebulous difficult to prove types of discrimination kick in meanwhile her male colleagues quietly note her ill treatment and opt out away from swedish models and wellintentioned spl legislation this seems to be the reality that the ongoing appalling treatment of mothers in the workplace is also affecting and influencing fathers making them deeply suspicious of and resistant to change even if they want it of course this could be wrong and there could be a huge takeup on spl but i rather doubt it in basic terms a cart has been put before a horse however tantalising the new childcare legislation men are unlikely to take advantage while mothers even those taking routine amounts of maternity leave are treated so brutally it is workplace discrimination laws that need to be strengthened and implemented with more force giving greater protection to all working parents thats parents mind you not just mothers it says something that while some men are the architects of workplace chauvinism and other men are stunted by it most of the time it is still women who bear the brunt finding their careers shipwrecked on a little island called womans problem hold

when users swipe theyll see a message that says if only it was that easy for those in need of a lifesaving organ to find a match you can see how this has happened the national organ donor shortage is a big problem and tinder is massively popular with a huge youth base that an nhs campaign might otherwise find difficult to reach good luck to the campaign lets hope it does some good however i cant help but think that this might be a slight ethical mismatch akin to pussy riot joining forces with spearmint rhino or the rspb trying to raise awareness via a bernard matthews turkey roll campaign

for a heartwarming shrinking confectionery story nestl has come under fire for shrinking its quality street at first i thought this meant that we would be picking up tiny green triangles and minuscule purple ones with tweezers laying hundreds of them delicately upon our tongues in the manner of bemused festive giants something to look forward to however before a cry goes up of honey i shrunk the sweeties it seems that they mean those big tins you get at christmas the ones you pretend you dont buy while encouraging visitors to partake of your organic carobbrittle that tastes like urinesoaked gravel is trying to rebrand as a quality foodstuff getting back to quality street it seems that the big tins are not so big any more theyve been getting progressively smaller to prove it a woman who has kept her tins over the years has photographed them in a descending line the effect is rather wonderful a cross between a turner prize entry commenting on the diminishing effects of commercialism on the human spirit and a purple sweetiethemed loch ness monster and indeed the newest tin does look as though the two older tins have sat on it however amusing it is to think of someone keeping quality street tins all this time perhaps patiently waiting to make this exact point product shrinkage is a real thing nestl has denied it saying it has a range of differentsized tins but it has not escaped consumer attention that instead of items becoming more expensive often they get smaller instead so in the festive spirit gawd bless nestl for giving the public the christmas gift of making

last june tim hunt and mary collins sat on the sofa in the front room of their hertfordshire cottage and wept openly clinging to each other for comfort hunts jokes about the alleged lachrymose tendencies of female researchers at an international conference that week had gone viral and the couple were bombarded with abuse on social media when they were interviewed by the observer both looked tired and unhappy we were in shock collins recalls that was then during their interview with the observer last week both scientists were laughing and poking fun at each other they even posed for photographs clutching guides to japanese gardens and cuisine a reference to the new life they are starting mary collins a senior scientist at university college london ucl has been appointed director of research for a prestigious new university the okinawa institute of science and technology setting up the institute is a big commitment by the japanese cabinet and it will be my job to build up the faculty and make sure this university works she says the aim is to establish a worldleading interdisciplinary research centre on the island the institute already has top people in fields that range from theoretical physics to marine biology we will be doing stuff there that you cannot do anywhere else okinawa is a subtropical island south of mainland japan and its geography gives it key advantages you can study deepsea vents which are close to the island and work on coral that sort of thing we are also extremely well funded she says the institutes budget last year was around m in a few days collins and hunt who were married years ago and have two daughters will head off to okinawa for a brief tour of the institute and its facilities before returning to the island in the summer with their dog molly a maltese shih tzu to spend the next five years there i love japan says hunt i will be very happy i will do the shopping and the cooking the couples move is the latest but almost certainly not the last twist in one of the most extraordinary academic tales of recent years hunt who won the nobel prize in physiology for his work on cell division was attending a conference in seoul in june when he was asked to speak at a meeting about women in science let me tell you about my trouble with girls he told delegates three things happen when they are in the lab you fall in love with them they fall in love with you and when you criticise them they cry his words were tweeted around the world though no mention was made of the fact that he had followed his remarks with the phrase now seriously before praising the achievements of women scientists in korea hunt was deluged with electronic hate mail and was hounded from several academic posts he was flying back from seoul to britain after making his remarks when collins was called at home by ucl where she is a professor and a former dean while hunt was an honorary researcher collins was told by a senior academic that she had to call her husband the moment he landed to tell him he had to resign immediately or be sacked hunt chose the former though he insists that ucl never asked him for his account of the affair worse was to follow the european research council erc hunt served on its science committee decided to force him to stand down in view of his resignation from ucl under pressure he quit a series of other posts in vain hunt issued several apologies for his inappropriate comments my remarks were inexcusable i admit it he says today hunt has only two posts left one at the crick institute which opens soon in london the other at the weizmann institute in israel it took me several weeks to realise how badly misrepresented i had been i was turned into a straw man that one lot loves to love and the other lot loves to hate and then they just take up sides and hurled utterly vile abuse at everyone it was extraordinary a week after the storm broke hunt and collins agreed to an interview with the observer in which they said they had been hung out to dry by ucl and other organisations a backlash took place and figures such as richard dawkins brian cox and boris johnson offered sympathy while a number of prominent female scientists including biologist professor ottoline leyser of cambridge university nancy rothwell vicechancellor of manchester university and dame athene donald professor of experimental physics at cambridge as well as many young women who had worked in hunts laboratories came forward to express support and exonerate him of the charge of sexism but not of making stupid jokes but hunt and collins are still pained by the experience it is the world of twitter blogging and leaving comments on stories online that did so much damage using them is such an utterly worthless waste of time says collins the couples room is crammed with books mostly on science cooking and gardening there is a signed warhol picture and a pair of medieval prints that once belonged to hunts father richard a historian nevertheless it is clear they will both be glad to make a new start after their tribulations collins says she applied for the okinawa post before the controversy erupted i was headhunted before june by the institute and made a strong application in return because i thought this looks a great job we are glad we are going but we are not doing so because we have been chased out of the country this sort of job was always part of my life plan she says the loss of a leading uk female scientist is perhaps one of the more ironic outcomes of the hunt affair as professor donald points out the uk needs to have more visible senior female role models and champions in science to inspire future generations of talented female scientists mary collinss departure to japan is therefore a huge loss to her community however japan probably has even more need of such visible women scientists than this country and the uks loss is their gain for his part hunt who will be in february is enthusiastic about the move its going to be an adventure he says i will learn japanese and do all sorts of things its a great country collins says japanese universities suffer a little bit because the language is a barrier english is the language of science journals are in english and so in britain we do quite well the okinawa institute will be international and english will be the language used there it is a new approach for them there are strong academic links between the uk and japan and we are alike in many ways we are both island nations are understated in our demeanour have good senses of humour and both like seafood hunt agrees its known as the hawaii of japan a tropical paradise what is there to lose the hunt controversy june at a lunch for female journalists and scientists during the world conference of science journalists in seoul hunt was asked to make a speech in which he described my trouble with girls june after some audience members shared hunts comments on social media hunts comments were reported in the press in an interview with the today programme hunt apologised for causing any offence hunt resigned from his position as an honorary professor at ucl june in an exclusive interview with the observer hunt said he had been hung out to dry and revealed that he resigned from ucl after being told that if he did not he would be sacked june former students and colleagues of hunt wrote to the times criticising ucl june jonathan dimbleby resigned his honorary fellowship at ucl in protest at its disgraceful treatment of hunt july a recording emerged of hunts remarks in which it was clear he intended them in jest and that some of the audience had laughed october the scientist sir colin blakemore resigned as honorary president of the association of british science writers because it supported connie st louis one of the journalists present at hunts speech who was accused of presenting

the comedian kate smurthwaite received abusive tweets for objecting when a mens rights activist called her darling in a tv debate some called her bitch slut harpy some were explicit threats of violence and rape after going on question time the historian mary beard received hundreds of messages attacking her appearance and the scientist emily grossman received so many hostile sexist tweets when she talked about sexism in science she was forced to take a break from social media but its not just public figures ive heard stories of teenagers who have stopped going into college women who have withdrawn from social media or been forced to change their work after being bombarded with online attacks we shouldnt stand for this the internet is an amazing thing a way to give a voice to the voiceless reinvigorate democracy inspire debate a third of us use facebook a fifth of us are on twitter social media is where we live our lives work play gossip and chat our new streets offices pubs parks and public spaces and that means everyone should be part of it the internet has to be a way to speak truth to power and to hold the powerful to account not a way for the powerful or the abusive to silence the truth we need to be able to express anger disagreement or contempt in an argument and its really important in a democracy for those in power to see the strength of feeling about decisions they take but just as we would on the streets in the pub or at work we have to challenge misogyny racism homophobia and intimidation or threats against others that are designed to silence debate lets be honest technology and new media move fast and this is all so new that no one is sure where we should draw the line or whose responsibility it is to act and i wont pretend to know all the answers but as stella creasy who has led campaigning in this area has argued we cant keep ignoring it because its hard so heres where the debate should start first we need new guidelines and capacity for the police and prosecutors to deal with violent threats hate crime and stalking which clearly break the law too many people feel they dont get the protection they need second institutions could do more pubs give people warnings if they are being abusive or kick them out if they are harassing other customers the new social spaces social media and newspapers that publish online comments need to think about their responsibilities too membership organisations can set standards of behaviour they expect the labour party has rules to prevent sexism racism or bullying in meetings its time to apply the same principles online why dont the tories snp lib dems and ukip do the same third more support and advice those who have suffered the worst persistent abuse say they feel very alone but right now the rest of us dont really know how to help or stand with them whether to confront any online sexism thrown at us or ignore it ive always tended to ignore it feeling i cant really be bothered to give it any oxygen but everydaysexism has shown the power of shouting back and speaking out and fourth we need to do more to prevent the next generation thinking online misogyny racism or hatred is ok and to prevent it from contaminating offline relationships too we need compulsory sex and relationship education in schools to promote respect in relationships and zero tolerance of violence or threats but whatever the answers we cant ignore this issue any more a century ago the suffragettes fought against the silencing of women in public and political life in the s and s feminists began the campaign against the violence threats or harassment that silenced women in the home or on the streets founding the first refuges and organising marches to reclaim the night each time campaigning women challenged and changed culture we need to do the same again now so women are not silenced on the new streets of social media so no one is drowned out by bullying and abuse its time for women and men to stand together against sexist abuse misogyny racism and violent threats online so the web can be the amazing democratic space we need it to be it is time to reclaim the internet,2015-12,comedian kate smurthwaite received abusive tweet objecting men right activist called darling tv debate called bitch slut harpy explicit threat violence rape going question time

reading through tuesdays two damning reports into domestic violence and the police handling of it that old adage comes to mind the test of any civilised society is how it treats its vulnerable its increasingly hard to deny that its not only the individual men who choose to abuse their wives girlfriends exes or relatives who are failing this test but also the state services meant to protect their victims almost threequarters of police forces in england and wales are letting down vulnerable victims defined as children disabled people and people subjected to repeat abuse according to the police inspectorate of the police forces in england and wales hmic judged just to be good and none to be outstanding at protecting vulnerable people this is evidence of a widespread failure to assess or support the very victims who need it most by the very people entrusted with helping them in the second inquiry hmic found police to be nearly overwhelmed by the increase in reports of domestic violence a staggering in months it feels strange on impulse to see this rise described by the report as a sign of improvement importantly an increase in reports does not necessarily mean an increase in the crime and its clear progress that more victims are feeling able to come forward but its difficult to say anyone in a position of power should currently feel particularly proud whether thats the police failing to help victims when they risk their safety to make a report or the government cutting refuge services for them to flee to for an insight into just how deep these cuts go since refuge has seen a reduction in funding across of its service contracts some by as much as this is being exacerbated by a growth in shortterm funding a senior manager at refuge tells me that services that may have previously been commissioned every five years are now being put on oneyear contracts sometimes less a number of commissioners have even asked them for cuts during a contract the result a decrease in the time women and children are able to stay in a refuge as reported last month the conservatives new cut to social housing rents also means many housing association chiefs say theyll now have to scale back specialised housing for women fleeing domestic violence the biggest danger for a socalled civilised society is to convince itself domestic violence is inevitable that women will always be beaten raped or killed often in their own homes and that theres just not much the state can do but its simply not true every police force can adopt standardised highquality training to rid the system of the postcode lottery and address what womens aid describe to me as cultural attitudes by police officers that may stop victims feeling believed or taken seriously police can also utilise tools already in place such as domestic violence protection orders which can protect victims immediately after abuse incidents the government for its part can create central ringfenced funding for domestic violence provision showing that womens lives are not an expense austerity can afford to risk if anyone needed motivation they might take a look at the counting dead women site a list of the women suspected to have been killed by men in this country this year in the first week of natalia czekaj was stabbed more than times and almost decapitated her boyfriend was jailed for six years for her manslaughter a year from now how many victims will have tried to report their abuser only to be let down by the police how many will have tried to escape to a refuge only to find it shut down by government cuts women deserve more than platitudes lives depend on it,2015-12,reading tuesday two damning report domestic violence police handling old adage come mind test civilised society treat

jon ronsons latest book so youve been publicly shamed looks at how some peoples lives have been ruined by the reaction to an illjudged socialmedia confession or a clumsy tweet a new chapter for the paperback edition reports on how he too became a victim of aggressive censure for suggesting that the shaming of people like rachel dolezal the white civilrights campaigner who identified herself as black was a form of vicious mob rule the phrase that kept cropping up in my mind as i read your book was the way a news of the world journalist described his job this is what we do we go out and destroy other peoples lives it used to be the most outofcontrol tabloid journalists doing that is it now anonymous socialmedia trolls ive noticed all year this weird psychological thing going on that people who love finding faults in others for abuses of power react with a fury when it is pointed out that they are abusing the power of social media themselves time and again on twitter we act like the thing we purport to hate at least with conventional media there is some protection from shaming in the law max mosley got his day in court yes but there is a toxic relationship between mainstream media and social media i think to begin with old media just ignored twitter then it tried to emasculate it by doing the best tweeters pieces trying to control it i remember feeling disappointed about that because the whole point of twitter was that it was egalitarian someone with a hundred twitter followers can be just as entertaining as someone with a hundred thousand and then what happened was that mainstream media began to bow to twitters agenda setting obviously you were quite seduced by it to start with and not above a bit of naming and shaming yourself didnt alarm bells go off not to start with i thought it offered a chance to do things better to right certain wrongs but what quickly started to happen was this kind of mob mentality you talk in the book about being bullied as a teenager i guess that is one of the reasons you became a journalist to stand up for people without power and to hold to account or ridicule those who abuse it is that what also drew you to this subject yes when i saw what happened to justine sacco who saw her life ruined after she tweeted a joke in poor taste about the racial politics of aids in africa i definitely responded to that in part because of the experience of being bullied at school that kind of selfrighteous bullying that was happening to justine bullying in the name of compassion it seems to me that the harshness of the tone of social media is having a direct effect on politics and public life increasing polarities i really liked barbara ellens line in the observer when did being moderate become an insult i agree things have become more extreme i think it is in part because social media is a stage for constant artificial high drama everyone is either a magnificent hero or a sickening villain that is the toxic gift that twitter has given grey areas have become unfashionable because nuance and empathy and factchecking become seen as a sign of weakness yes in the first talk i gave about the book i compared twitter to the stasi and the audience kind of loudly tutted and i thought the only reason you are tutting is that you havent thought this through we have created this surveillance society where we are always looking for clues to our neighbours secret inner evil the obvious argument against the stasi comparison is that people dont have to participate though increasingly i suppose young people in particular find it hard not to yes and of course the stasi were stealing peoples secrets where the people i am talking about give theirs up voluntarily but then justine sacco had twitter followers she sent her joke to she could not have expected that by the time she got off her plane that tweet would be the number one trending story around the world i think people can reasonably assume that when they send a message to a hundred followers nothing terribly bad is going to happen i dont think the analogy is nuts has the reaction to the book been different in america the book became very talked about in america i have felt like ive spent all year explaining it the problem was that almost no one who attacked the book had read it it was seen as an attack on social justice do you find yourself selfcensoring these days i do totally online not in my writing im hardly every attacked for stuff i write in a book i think everyone with a load of twitter followers now feels like they are in a minefield like a bomb disposal expert working out which wire to cut you used to be a tweetaday man do you miss that i do miss the old days sharing jokes with strangers really helped my mental health to begin with people would admit little things about themselves and other people would say oh my god im exactly the same there was this shared destigmatising thing that is at risk of going its now often about hunting for peoples transgressions and shameful secrets this censorious attitude filters out into the real world it seems we have the absurd situation where say germaine greer cant talk at universities because of socialmedia pressure i went to college in the s in london we were all socialjustice people but there was always one person who was way more social justice than everyone else it can seem like that fucker from the s is now in charge and no one is allowed to say anything i mean i still consider myself a politically correct person and we dont want to go back to racism and sexism and homophobia of course but it has got to the point where a lot of comedians over here ronson now lives in new york wont play colleges in case someone puts something online out of context as you argue in the book there are financial imperatives for twitter and google and facebook and the rest to maintain this attitude yes the corporations dont want blandness or complexity they want spikes of outrage journalism was always about speaking truth to power but increasingly people are wary of trying to speak truth to social media i think the paperback edition of so youve been publicly shamed is published on december picador click here to preorder it for the jon ronson mysteries is at leicester square theatre london january,2015-12,jon ronsons latest book youve publicly shamed look people

the proportion of women who carry the main financial responsibility for their family has increased by about since according to the ippr thinktank now a third of britains working mothers are the main breadwinners in their family and most of this millionstrong group are low earners but why are more mothers becoming the main earners today how do these working women differ from their male equivalents and how do lowerearning dads feel about their roles in the home furthermore who does the majority of the cleaning and the cooking in such households and who pays for dinner on a night out we interviewed five couples where the mother is the main earner to find out i feel lucky that i dont need to worry about money steven scarbrough lives in farnborough hampshire with his wife anastasia petrova and yearold stepdaughter apollo anastasia earns as a telecoms director steven earns as a sensors assembly specialist it took me a long time to meet such a wonderful woman i wasnt worried she earned more steven says i know i contribute in other ways at home for example when we first met five years ago anastasia did a lot of the cooking and the housework but she works longer hours than me and commutes for two hours so shes tired when she gets home now i do all the cooking during the week and we share the housework we have separate accounts ill pay for the running of the car phones and food anastasia pays the council tax and our joint mortgage although i contributed to the original deposit if we go out for a takeaway around here ill pay but if we go to london for a posh meal shell pay it certainly doesnt embarrass me if she pays im very proud of her i think its a winwin situation i can understand how some men might not like it but im more openminded i feel lucky i dont need to worry about money it doesnt really matter to me who pays for what were a family one of the main benefits of anastasia earning more is she can afford to give apollo a private education theres no way i could have afforded that and the fact anastasia earns more than me and always will because i didnt get much of an education is spurring apollo on at school i see that as a massive positive i hid photos of my kids from my boss jo mainwaring and her husband richard live in the cotswolds near cirencester they have two children ellie and sam jo earns a sixfigure salary as a sales director and has been the main breadwinner for years bringing in up to of the couples household income my husband never felt guilty about working while the children were growing up but i did says jo i went back to work less than four months after giving birth and absolutely hated being apart from the children i had to go back to pay the bills my husband ran his own waterskiing business and due to its seasonality his earnings were irregular but he loved his job and i wanted him to be happy i also felt id brought the children into the world and they were my responsibility i wanted to provide for them myself i remember in those days men in my office would be congratulated for becoming a dad women would not be a womans children were viewed as an inconvenience to the business i used to hide my photos of ellie and sam from my boss we had a nanny who cost more than our mortgage i would travel a lot and work hours a week although a fair bit of that was from home richard worked hours a week and sometimes i envied the time he got to spend with the children although he was an oldschool father hes only changed two nappies in his life i did all the cooking and we had a cleaner to do the housework we have completely separate accounts and split the cost of our joint bills equally transferring money across as necessary if we go out for lunch generally ill pay but if its a dinner or were in company we revert back to stereotypes and richard normally pays i handle the discretionary spending on the children we used to argue about it richard would say they dont need that it would be better if you paid more off the mortgage instead but hes given up its a guilt thing when youre a working mum you spend more money on your children i remember realising at a shop in dsseldorf airport that there wasnt a single toy i hadnt already bought them i never buy anything without consulting him naomi willis and her husband ricky live in tunbridge wells kent with their two children chloe three and daniella naomi earns a year as an hr manager while ricky author of the awardwinning skintdadcouk blog earns up to as a parttime freelance writer in we realised that after paying our monthly childcare bill and commuting costs we were in the red at the end of each month so ricky gave up his fulltime job and i became the main breadwinner says naomi although i wasnt earning much more than ricky it made more sense financially for him to stop working because his commute into london was very expensive but i would like to have been the one to stay at home i went back to work fulltime less than nine months after each of my daughters were born and i wouldve liked more time with them i know children are hard work but i also think it would be a more relaxed life my salary goes into my personal account i pay all the joint bills and transfer money to ricky as and when he needs it when we have a night out ill withdraw cash and give it to him that way hes in control of what we spend during the evening and can go and get the drinks it also makes him look like hes got his own money because the money i earn belongs to both of us we manage it together i never buy anything without consulting him even though he sometimes wishes i would even if ive got to buy a new pair of shoes ill ask him if he minds i worried that i would feel resentful about ricky not working like i was missing out but im happy when we both worked fulltime i used to do most of the cooking now ricky does about of it and dinners normally ready when i arrive home we shared the housework before now he does most of it that means i get to spend more time with chloe and daniella when i get in but hes the favourite they are definitely daddys girls am i there for the children enough zoe davies lives in ilkeston derbyshire with her husband andrew handley and their two children megan and sam zoe earns through her avon business while andrew earns as a car valet i became the main breadwinner four years ago zoe says andy had a valeting business that was nearly closed down overnight by a bad debt owed to him by another company i threw myself into my avon business which id started doing parttime while our children were young previously id worked hour weeks earning so i could be there for the kids when they were young i also did the majority of the cleaning and all the cooking now i head up a team of people and work hour weeks andy does most of the cooking and a lot of the housework its not an easy transition for any man but hes happy and everythings tidy when i get home it happened gradually we didnt specify what each of us should be doing but we could both see where the money was coming from our wages are paid into our own personal accounts and then we each transfer some money into an account that pays the bills we pay in amounts in proportion to the income we earn id always wanted to run my own business but i really had no choice when andys valeting business closed due to the debts we incurred it had to work i had a mortgage two children and five dogs to support now i know i can give my children everything they want i have gained so much confidence in myself i still ask myself am i there for the children enough but an avon business is designed to be very flexible around family life i feel a lot happier and more financially secure than i used to looking after the kids can be very rewarding chris pearson and his wife kaira live near oswestry shropshire with their two children gabriel four and micah seven months kaira an orthopaedic surgeon is the sole breadwinner and earns a year chris a cambridgeeducated forensic scientist became a stayathome dad two years ago my job was in london and kaira got a job in macclesfield chris says we tried to make it work but i was earning less than my job was costing us in childcare commuting and rent and wed decided early on in our relationship to always put kairas career first it made perfect logical sense to me because her earnings potential is much higher than mine and can give us as a family unit a better lifestyle kairas salary goes into the joint account and that money is our money i try to contribute financially by being efficient i have a household budget that i stick to and will save money by cooking everything including all micahs baby food from scratch and growing our own produce kaira organises paying the bills while i run the household the cooking and cleaning are my responsibility i try to give kaira who has an minute commute and spends one night a week away on call as little housework to do as possible i feel its good for our sons to see their dad doing domestics tasks and their mother going out to work im proud of that although intellectually it can feel like im stagnating looking after the kids can be very rewarding but it can also be very very hard and a bit lonely its odd to do this role after employment theres so little external validation it helps that kaira is very supportive she makes me feel valued,2015-12,proportion woman carry main financial responsibility family ha increased since according ippr thinktank third britain working mother main

if there was one country in the world that was going to be the first to make a feminist text compulsory reading for its teenagers it was always going to be sweden the first country to break the ceiling for female political representation in the s sweden has since accumulated many other firsts when it comes to gender equality but that swedes selected the work of a nigerian writer chimamanda ngozi adichie as the book of choice for every yearold is a milestone not just for swedish feminism but for global feminism throughout the th century from the first international feminist congress in buenos aires in to the conventions in mexico nairobi and beijing feminism always sought to connect womens voices from around the world today that no longer seems true feminism today is marked by a crippling village mentality an unwillingness to see beyond the issues that affect ones own community im not suggesting that having a global view is easy the barriers presented by race sexual orientation and class are not sometimes difficult to grasp as microaggressions far outnumber outright discrimination nor am i saying that feminism cant have regional differences after all i write an african feminist blog but although there are nuances to my struggle which are important to me as a woman of african heritage i find the diminishing interest in feminist movements in asia africa and latin america unfortunate especially because the systems that affect women are increasingly global whether it is reproductive rights the growth of religious fundamentalism child labour poverty or climate change many of the issues that have a negative impact on womens rights can only wholly be understood when situated within a global perspective this is why distributing adichies book we should all be feminists to high school students is truly something to rejoice its a book about sexism in nigeria but its relatable even in feminist sweden we should all be reading adichies book as well as countless other feminist books from around the globe that expand and consequently strengthen the feminist movement as the late selfdescribed black lesbian mother warrior poet audre lorde said it is not our differences that divide us it is our inability to recognise accept and celebrate those differences lordes book sister outsider is an essential read as a collection of essays exploring race sexism and homophobia it can help the budding feminist transcend the deafening noise that surrounds these topics on social media there is a calmness to lordes righteous anger a deep wisdom and a commitment to global feminism however frustrating achieving it may be another feminist book that everyone should read is woman at point zero by nawal el saadawi although fictional it is based on a true account of a woman who is awaiting execution in a cairo prison it tells a harrowing story of growing up poor and female in egypt of being raped undergoing fgm and being married off to a yearold as a teenager this is the book that teaches its reader about the vicious nature of unhinged patriarchy but also about feminist awakening and there is more out there for the globallyminded feminist karima bennounes your fatwa does not apply here is an important book for our times tackling how women and men in the middle east north africa and south asia are fighting religious fundamentalism often risking their own lives in a similar vein mona eltahawys headscarves and hymens why the middle east needs a sexual revolution is a mustread for understanding how gender fits not only into the arab revolutions but protest generally chandra talpade mohantys under western eyes as well as the complementary under western eyes revisited are possibly the most illuminating essays about the challenges and opportunities of global feminism broadening the focus on feminism from social justice to environmental justice the recently published why women will save the planet includes writing by leading global feminists on the urgent need to link the environmental and feminist movements it demonstrates that achieving gender equality is vital if we are to protect the environment upon which we all depend these are all necessary global feminist reads but for the most part theyre intellectual arguments to affect change the arts poetry and mythology must be seen as just as important as academic

i love feminism now its wild and punchy and its leaders are young and fearless flamethrowers that unapologetically say i write for women feminism before the internet before these chicks came along seemed to be winding down there was a raft of articles along the lines that feminism was dead and according to this on the bbc website no longer appropriate they critics of feminism believe what is really needed is a stable and prosperous society for everyone rather than one thats disrupted in the interests of any one group feminism in the s was older feminists writing despairing opeds in broadsheets asking where are all the feminists why dont young women call themselves feminists anymore here in australia it was the era of john howards prime ministership during which race and terrorism and islam were the masts we lashed ourselves to and feminism became a movement that belonged to an earlier age it was the former pm himself saying that young women were now living in the postfeminist period but open up that box and it was full of cheap costume jewellery it was girls gone wild and boozed ladettes brazilian waxes and internet porn boob jobs from your boyfriend and beating the boys at their own drinking games the beauty myth the book that galvanised young women in the s women like myself who slopped around campus wearing massive jumpers and flannelette shirts and who had to be taught years later at the makeup counter of department store david jones how to correctly apply eyeliner was a relic from another age the plastic surgeons won that battle it was sex and the city and girl power but the power was really the power of capitalism and individualism and getting what you wanted for yourself sisterhood was a term that was starting to be used ironically feminism in the s wasnt the thrilling slightly dangerous ride that we are on now fuelled by risk and anger and adrenalin where people are mobilised to act like lightning after a callout on twitter or facebook now you can see a movement in many ways because it is actually moving and very quickly no sooner is a piece criticising a feminist published than the social media backlash begins the valkyrie leading the charge at the moment the prominent feminist writer clementine ford wrote on facebook this week in response to a new matilda piece written by a man that said in effect she wasnt doing feminism right the times are changing feminism is reembracing a state of emergency occasionally someone storms onto my page or across my radar to tell me that im setting feminism back by decades my answer to that is good lets go back to the days of radical anger and activism informed by current awareness of intersectionality and politics the feminism of the s was bullshit lets put on our boilersuits and get some shit done during the last couple of weeks in australia the debate around reporting men who harass high profile feminists on social media has been full blown vivid and that rare thing in the time of twitter spats gamechanging i felt distressed when i read the blog detailing the gratuitous grotesque abuse ford received and initially applauded her and other feminists fighting back by naming and shaming abusers ford reported one of her harassers to his employer and he lost his job as a result there must be consequences for that level of abuse but why should women have to take on these measures themselves measures that can bring further risk to their personal safety in the socalled boring years of feminism the s things were getting done around here new systems were getting bedded down and the old system was reexamined including inquiries into gender bias in the provision of legal aid and in victoria the establishment of specialist family violence courts and an overhaul of the response of the states police to family violence by chief commissioner christine nixon but it is an ongoing project that is still imperfect and incomplete women such as my colleague van badham who have been on the frontline of serious threats and attacks argue quite rightly that the system is slow and not built to keep up with the sleek quickmoving beast that is the internet many criminal codes were originally drawn up when the internet was a twinkle in nobodys eye women who are harassed on the internet could seek to rely on section of the criminal code act cth which makes it an offence to use a carriage service to menace harass or cause offence along with using a carriage service to make a threat punishment is a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a fine of but there is the hurdle of threat oneoff posts by strangers on facebook calling you a slut or hoping you die might not be enough to pass all the necessary legal requirements for feeling threatened which traditionally has meant a certain level of fear that occurs when the harassment occurs repeatedly and at close range the law needs to be expanded to encompass penalties for trolling how about amending criminal codes to make posting offensive vile and threatening messages on peoples social media pages come not only under stalking provisions but become a public decency offence calling someone a slut on their facebook page should be akin to urinating in public common standards of decency are offended and there should be a penalty for that with the penalties becoming more severe depending on the nature of the threats there are curious echoes now of seismic shifts of feminism in the s where there was debate about whether to fight sexual assault and harassment through the police and the courts or whether a knee to the balls so to speak was the best form of retribution in when a sex scandal erupted at melbourne universitys ormond college helen garner wrote about the incident in the first stone a master was accused of groping some students at a party garner a second wave feminist couldnt grasp why the young women went to the police to complain about the master why they chose to take the matter to court why did the women instead of delivering a swift knee to the groin of the letch charged past conciliation into the traditional masculine style of problemsolving call in the cops split off the nuances of character and relevant context and hire a cowboy to slug it out for you in the main street at noon with all the citizenry watching feminists of garners generation favoured direct action taking it to the man attacking his body if need be when she first read about the incident garner wrote i got on the phone to women friends my age feminists pushing fifty they had all noticed the newspaper item and been unsettled by it he touched her breast and she went to the cops my god why didnt she get her mother or her friends to help her sort him out later if she couldnt deal with it herself at the time this same issue is being debated today albeit in radically different contexts should feminists hit back go rogue and outside the system or should they do as the women of ormond did and go to the police take the legal route use the processes put in place this issue bitterly divided australian feminists in the s it was more than just a generational divide it was a battle for territory and it was a debate that asked how do we want things to unfold when a person complains of sexual harassment what sort of society do we want to live in,2015-12,love

police are not doing enough to protect victims of honourbased violence hbv forced marriage and female genital mutilation according to a report by the police watchdog the first report by hm inspectorate of constabulary hmic on forces responses to the set of crimes which disproportionately affect women from ethnic minorities found that only three of the forces in england and wales were adequately prepared in all areas to respond to the needs of victims and take cases through to prosecution inspectors found that welltrained and experienced officers who can identify and protect victims at an early stage were spread thinly while attempts to adapt existing domestic abuse and child protection procedures could not take into account specific challenges posed by honourbased violence the inspector of constabulary wendy williams said it is clear that the police service has some way to go before the public can be confident that honourbased violence is properly understood by the police and that potential and actual victims are adequately and effectively protected hbv which refers to a collection of oppressive practices used to control the behaviour of women and girls usually within families to protect cultural and religious beliefs has become increasingly highprofile in recent years cases such as those of banaz mahmod who was raped and murdered by her family in after leaving her husband and yearold tulay goran who was murdered by her father after a romeo and julietstyle romance have raised its profile but hmics report found few forces had taken enough steps to fully tackle the problem in and there were successful prosecutions for hbv in the cases where prosecutions did not end with a conviction the top reason for the cases failing was that the victim retracted the complaint hmics report raised concerns about the identification recording and flagging of cases on police computer systems some forces had very limited or no capability at all to flag cases without accurate data the scale of the problem and the effectiveness of the police response to it cannot be properly assessed the report said more importantly victims may be placed at risk if the context of their records is not clear in some cases officers spoke to precisely the wrong type of person as they attempted to investigate the circumstances surrounding allegations including family and community members who may have been involved in the abuse jasvinder sanghera chief executive of karma nirvana which supports victims of hbv and forced marriages said her organisation had lobbied for the inspection after a separate report on domestic violence failed to include the issue she said the kn helpline receives calls every day from victims experiencing hbv and forced marriage however it still is very much a postcode lottery as to if you are going to be protected or not it remains dependent who you get on the day and their level of awareness many victims are still not believed the abuse is dealt with as cultural and the family is still deemed as the protective factor when clearly in these cases it is your family you are reporting victims always have multiple perpetrators who are extremely convincing and do not report these abuses they are organised and will work collectively to deceive the police and further isolate victims sanghera added this report is welcomed and long overdue as we continue to shift attitudes related to cultural sensitivities in separate research conducted by academics from the university of bristol and published alongside the hmic report victims of hbv said police often found it difficult to understand their situations one said that it seemed that officers were afraid of appearing as though they were racist another a victim of both forced marriage and hbv said she was surprised by what she faced when she came to the uk it really isnt as bad in the victims home country as it is here in the uk with what happens to girls the anonymised statement said at least in the victims home country people are afraid that these girls might speak and ruin their reputation so its a question of honour here no one is scared because they know they can send the girls back home and some of the girls do just that because like me they probably dont know any better one participant suggested that authorities hand women information about their rights when they first enter the uk at ports and airports to empower them to be independent of their husbands and inlaws if they need to be however the research found a number of victims who had insecure immigration status and no recourse to public funds which they felt made access to safe accommodation and support difficult the chief inspector of constabulary sir thomas winsor said the vulnerability of victims and potential victims of these crimes comes principally from their sense of helplessness and hopelessness their fear or conviction that their circumstances are not or will not be understood and the fact that the people closest to them are the people who are most dangerous to them cultural traditions and sensitivities deserve and should always be given due respect but where they operate to imprison vulnerable people behind barriers of fear and the threat or reality of violence and facilitate or intensify crimes committed against them such barriers must be broken they deserve no respect at all a statement from the national police chiefs council said the report from her majestys inspectorate of constabulary makes several important recommendations that underline the

education experts are calling on the government to review its bedroom tax after early research indicated it was having an adverse impact on learning because affected children were stressed and hungry at school researchers from manchester university found that children were showing signs of emotional distress because they were seeing their parents under pressure and were experiencing material hardship as a result of the benefit cut parents were having to cut back on food shopping for fewer and cheaper provisions and hungry children were finding it harder to concentrate in lessons sometimes leading to classroom unrest and aggressive behaviour the report said one father of four is quoted as saying my financial situation at the moment is very bleak very bleak i have to my name and i have no money till tuesday so you can imagine the cupboards are nearly bare i am just struggling a mother of four describes her sons attempts to shield her from extra expense he was freezing and he was too scared to say to me mum i need a coat because he didnt want to put added pressure on me the smallscale exploratory study is the first to examine the effects of the policy on children and their education the bedroom tax was introduced by the coalition government in april in an attempt to encourage social housing tenants to move from bigger properties into smaller homes it was one element in a raft of benefits changes for workingage adults and it resulted in cuts in housing benefits of an average of a week a year for those deemed to have one spare bedroom and more for those with two the research was carried out in manchester over a month period from march and took the form of indepth interviews with parents with schoolaged children between them researchers also questioned representatives from schools housing associations and community groups among them headteachers family support workers housing officers local faith leaders and youth workers they were told that parents were cutting back on food heating warm winter clothes shoes and school uniforms because of the benefit cut some parents said they were regularly going without food so their children could eat and families reported feeling more isolated with children enjoying less access to friends and afterschool activities the study by researchers at manchester institute of education found that forcing children to share bedrooms under the policy two children of the same sex under are expected to share as are two children under regardless of sex was also having a negative impact on learning with no quiet place for homework and teenagers sleep disturbed by younger siblings in addition the manchester research claimed that the policy was not persuading families to downsize as well as a lack of suitable smaller properties in the social housing sector parents said they were prepared to lose money and suffer the hardship in order to stay in their home and keep local family ties and friendships ruth lupton professor of education at manchester university said the findings of this study confirm a wider picture emerging from research which points to the bedroom tax failing to meet its original aims while contributing to significant hardship among lowincome families our study suggests that the pressure put on families by this cut in benefits may also be working contrary to other policies that are intended to support child wellbeing and educational achievement diminishing their effectiveness erica burman also professor of education at manchester added the government should review its policy doing so would show a greater commitment to supporting children helping parents to maintain their responsibilities reinforcing communities tackling educational inequalities and ensuring that the effects of austerity do not fall disproportionately on poor families schools and community groups have responded to increased need by reallocating resources to ensure that children are fed and clothed schools have used pupil premium funding available to children from deprived backgrounds who are on free school meals to extend breakfast clubs in some schools staff have clubbed together to organise food parcels and christmas hampers for needy families others said resources were being allocated to welfare checks during school holidays to ensure children had enough to eat one school had opened its own account with a shoe shop another secondary school was providing girls with free sanitary supplies,2015-12,education expert calling government review bedroom tax early research indicated

back in the mids when the word was born in america a badass was not something you wanted to be it was plainly pejorative for one thing meaning as the random house historical dictionary of american slang has it a dangerous browbeating individual bully for another it was a word loaded with sarcasm as with tough guy or big man now it was used for the kind of men whose posturing invited mockery to call someone a badass was to seek to puncture puffedup masculine pride seventy years on however its precisely that swaggering macho quality that has given the word a new lexical lease of life as with ballsy another term rooted in maleness badass has been sufficiently appropriated to now apply less to men and more to women we wish to celebrate google trends the service that traces the popularity of search terms shows that the phrase badass women peaked in this in other words was the year in which badass underwent such a regendering that it became understood as the foremost battlecry of feelgood feminism from its roots as a putdown for men it has somehow become a term of endearment shorthand for empowered used by women for women beyonc bellwether of popcultural feminism had her own badass moment at a festival in september when she played audio of the martial arts fighter ronda rousey describing her body as femininely badass as fuck consider too the internets endless badassbandying listicles this year so many that they seemed to send the term beyond buzzword and into omniword the most badass ladies from game of thrones reasons hillary clinton is a total badass badass women on television right now plenty of these lists including books that every badass woman should read or badass women you should be following on instagram were badassing in the original sense of the verb browbeating and bullying are you unbadass if you dont follow these women and read these books is badass the only way to be as word fatigue started to creep in i remembered with faint embarrassment that id used it myself in the observer when i wrote about patti smith what did i mean exactly when i described the punk poet and singer as a consummate badass we use the term in the same spirit of its meaning swaggeringly and unthinkingly but when a word is this ubiquitous it matters language shapes us even the president of the united states dropped the term this year flexing putative feminist cred as he did so when obama met the us womens soccer team he told them this team taught all of americas children that playing like a girl means youre a badass it sounded perfectly on point until i realised that the president if were being etymologically pedantic had essentially just praised a team of sportswomen for behaving like guys the reverse surely of what he intended because although badassery claims the opposite it is in fact a mode of gendered compromise two years ago when facebook coo sheryl sandberg aka no on buzzfeeds seriously badass ladies who will make you proud to be a woman published lean in she chivvied professional women to do better not so much by challenging the sexism of their workplace but by dealing with it as the writer melissa gira grant put it in the washington post sandbergs understanding of leadership so perfectly internalises the power structures of institutions created and dominated by men that it cannot conceive of womens leadership outside of those narrow spaces the reclamation of badass may seem a far lighterhearted phenomenon than say the fact that in the uk about of people in national minimum wage jobs are women or that women are sacked each year simply for being pregnant all however boil down to the same blunt and intolerable message that its womens behaviour rather than the structures and systems that need to change jennifer lawrence who has become a postergirl for equal pay in hollywood is at the most privileged economic end of those systems inequities its in large part her outspokenness about the pay gap in her industry that has made her so frequently the object of the alwaysapprovingly used badass one listicle times jennifer lawrence was the badass woman we all aspire to be included she didnt give a fuck about falling up the stairs this was at the oscars where lawrence won an academy award for her role in silver linings playbook in fact lawrence being human did very much care later telling vanity fair it was one of the most embarrassing moments of my entire life it took me a while to be able to laugh about it i cried but what with not giving a fuck having become become a central tenet of female badassery we choose mostly to ignore her vulnerability and cheer on her tenacity the actor and filmmaker elizabeth banks recently had lawrence as her first ladybadass on her ask a badass webseries show where she sought to convince her guest of her own badassery by telling her you basically have a penis it was a joke of course but like most jokes theres something true and alarming beneath the humour if female badassery as we understand and value it comes down to maleness in the most basic and anatomical sense if virtual dicks are now the yardstick for female power then we have a problem because beneath the feelgood female bravura of badass is a decidedly feelbad notion namely that the only way a woman can exercise power is to submit herself to the drag in both senses of behaving like a man as the writer ann friedman has pointed out this where the term hits its limits as its most commonly used badass implies both toughness and disaffectedness its rare to look at someone whose chief qualities are measured thoughtfulness and open emotionality and declare her a total badass friedman has highlighted the ambivalence that one woman mac mcclelland feels towards the term mcclelland is frequently told that shes a badass for her work as a human rights reporter which has taken her to physically dangerous and emotionally gruelling territory as ever our conception of badassery tends to thrill to the former rather than honouring the latter this year mcclelland published a memoir about her ptsd as she told american magazine mother jones when im having really intense conversations with people about really intense things i am touched and impacted and affected by those things and sometimes those things make me cry to admit that those things make me cry can that not be a different kind of badass lets never stop cheering on female strength but maybe we can find more ways and words with which to do it badass isnt going out of business any time soon but the retrograde idea of guntoting bullying asskicking being the only kind of power women celebrate should women are often told to talk think or behave like men telling them to be badass enforces the same thing the more urgent message surely is that we might consider just talking and behaving like ourselves,2015-12,back mids word wa born america badass wa something wanted wa plainly pejorative one thing meaning random house

if the things said by men to women on the internet were said by men to their female colleagues in workplaces they would be fired if they were said by men to women in public spaces they would be removed if they were said by men to women in front of peers one hopes one hopes they would be socially excoriated fairfax columnist clementine ford has published a blog of all the misogynistic comments shes received on social media and its receiving much attention not only for the tenor of the comments but because ford pursued a complaint against one of her harassers who called ford a slut on her facebook page to that mans employer and he was fired as a result good about time and more of this as another female journalist on the internet it is a relief to finally see someone somewhere held to account for their abusive and womanhating behaviour the belittling and bullying threats and harassment cyberstalking and outright hate speech directed to women on the internet every day is realworld behaviour with realworld consequence and it should oblige realworld punishments they deserve it misogynistic hate speech on the internet directed towards women is debilitating demobilising often emotionally exhausting always timeconsuming and if the chemicals in a brand of paint or type of varnish provoked the same physical effects in a worker it would be banned of course i dont need to visit clems blog to appreciate what shes been going through since becoming a columnist for the guardian two and a half years ago and cybermaking a tentative foray into public life ive lived every attack on my own body speculation on my own sexuality lurid suggestion of my own sex life and endured explicit threats of violence full disclosure clem is a close friend close enough in fact to attract many of the same abusers lambasting us and any woman who exists in the accessible public space of the internet with the same lines of attack were fat and were sluts but were also too ugly to get laid and even though were both paid to talk for a living we have nothing to say and should shut up often the abusers confuse us with one another or with any number of other female commentators broadly on the left side of politics it has bred a sisterhood of shared resistance in a likeminded community of australian women on the internet jenna price jane caro catherine deveny karen pickering so many more we have forged firm friendships from shared experience of online hate catherine deveny and i were actually introduced by our shared lawyer he was defending me in a malicious lawsuit brought by one of these internet cranks and deveny of course had been through it all before we all have left and right by left and right the australians sharri markson is subjected to hate speech so is the daily telegraphs miranda devine and the behaviour remains shameful because while in a freespeech absolutist paradise words are just words and everyone just gets over it we live in a real world where obsessive hatreds can manifest as violence there was the man who told me hed come along to a demo i was attending to slit my throat would you take that chance there are always the anonymous deaththreats there was the abusive man on the street the man id never met pretending to be my exboyfriend and persuading other women to spy on me the unknown number of people who followed me home from work and spied in my apartment from across the road making observations on twitter the obsessive who took me to court who pursued subpoenas of my email account and to freeze access to my bank account and to have my passport seized the nazi site imploring readers to run me down if they saw me my photo handily supplied the man sexually harassing clementine ford by mocking up my twitter homepage and pretending to be me and the other day the packet of papers turned up in my house my house with depictions of gang rapes and female genital mutilation and the greatest of all threats unspoken i know where you live ive barely stayed the night there since im moving soon the researcher emma jane refuses to use the word trolling to describe this behaviour when it starts online she calls it cyberviolence acknowledging its tacit relationship with the violence its language justifies its a thin membrane not always contained usually the more serious attacks are anonymous this makes them hard to track inefficient for police to pursue dutifully i log all serious attacks upon me at the police station for the sake of a database that may somehow someday result in someones conviction as the police struggle to catch up their procedures to a technology that has far far outpaced them and find ways to investigate and prosecute these men its actions like clems that seem to be the only deliverable social sanctions and frankly one of the reasons i admire clementine is the energy shes found to pursue a sacking some days after long hours the most i can manage is to reach for the block button its tiring deleting messages from your twitter account but its a lot more manageable than hatred and despair,2015-12,thing said men woman internet said men female colleague workplace would
