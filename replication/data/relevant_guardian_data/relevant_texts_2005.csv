the cost of childcare in britain is rising at over three times the rate of inflation with nursery fees in inner london soaring by over the last year according to a survey published today parents in the capital typically paid a week for nursery care in up from in in the worst cases london parents are paying up to a week for fulltime nursery care research by the daycare trust found while the typical cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two in england has reached a week up from last year the average jump in the cost of nursery places was during more than triple the rate of inflation cpi is currently at with fees much higher than average in london and the southeast costs in scotland and wales included in the survey for the first time this year are cheaper at and respectively the trusts annual survey of childcare costs comes only weeks after the government pledged more help for parents in meeting fees as part of its year childcare strategy however nursery leaders today warn that ministers goal of universal affordable and highquality childcare will not become a reality without greater direct government investment to fund expansion and better pay for higher qualified staff the national child minding association also said that quality childcare comes at a price a fulltime place with a childminder now costs an average of a week or in the southeast the costs continue even when youngsters go to school a place at an outofschool club for hours a week costs up to in another challenge to the government which will promote its childcare record and ambitions prominently in the runup to the forthcoming general election the institute for fiscal studies suggests that the childcare tax credit the complex system used to help working families meet childcare bills could be scrapped and the cash spent on creating and subsidising more highquality childcare places not only do families face huge bills for childcare most are still struggling to find highquality affordable places for their children according to the daycare trust survey almost two thirds of local childcare information services said parents were reporting difficulties securing the care they wanted trust director stephen burke said the findings of this survey may make grim reading for some but parents across the uk already know too well the inflating cost of childcare while the steps indicated by the government in its year strategy are welcome parents of children right now need more access to affordable quality childcare to suit their needs availability of good childcare was still a huge issue he added to make childcare available to all there must be significant investment in the childcare workforce both to ensure there are enough staff and to ensure they are trained to the highest standards to care for our children the national day nurseries association warned that without more government investment nursery fee increases above inflation would continue the associations chief executive rosemary murphy said currently childcare workers subsidise the cost of childcare for parents as the average fee still only supports low wages she added that much more government funding would be needed if we are to achieve truly universal affordable highquality childcare without basing it on a lowpaid and poorly qualified workforce the latest figures confirm that britains childcare remains the most expensive in europe despite accelerating government efforts to address the issue by expanding places and providing some cash help for many working parents ministers have opted to fund the demand side of childcare through tax credits in a bid to give parents choice in the childcare market but the shortage of provision there are still only enough places for one in every four children has prompted some to question the approach other european countries notably in scandinavia invest significantly larger sums and spend directly on supporting childcare places a department for education and skills spokeswoman said that from april support through the childcare element of the working tax credit would rise from a maximum of a week to for two or more children while the proportion of costs paid would increase from to in april the government is also spending m a year from to address the particular problems of london which faces a chronic childcare shortage

kerry hartwellparry parent east liverpool sure start i am a young mum with three children under six there was no sure start when my youngest james was born i can do so much more with my two girls and everythings free at sure start i have been involved in it from the beginning in april since then i have become a volunteer play and stay group leader twice a week and a baby massage instructor my girls have enjoyed so many activities gym tots baby massage and messy play and have benefited from new services such as the tots health club and care at the chemist while i studied i used the crche and am now looking at what i would like to do as a career that is different from my current parttime shop work eventually id like to do a degree and become a teacher but my local sure start will have to change very quickly im not sure it will be able to afford all of the planned projects there is now a lot of emphasis on childcare for parents returning to work while this is important it has taken me a long time trying to find the right new employment and i personally still need a break with time away from my children so i feel sad that this opportunity may not be available to others in the future also the close links that sure start has with the health service are not being valued in all of the changes and i worry that these will become less important when it is linked more with the city council having a midwife in the breastfeeding group has led to more mothers breastfeeding and the baby massage has helped mums who have postnatal depression to bond with their babies i think sure start is perfect as it is and its definitely needed in this area so i hope the government will think again paul butler chair bellingham sure start south london we expected this to be a year programme and five years in theyre cutting it i feel very passionate about this it is too important to leave behind ive seen people like my deputy chair carla benefit from having a real say in how her community is run she has become empowered not in the patronising sense of the word but to take decisions that make a difference at the same time weve increased the birth weight of babies by having midwifery and health visiting locallybased and schools are saying that children who have been through sure start are coming to them more ready to learn margaret hodge the childrens minister is wrong to say weve been controlled by whitehall it has overseen a programme run by local people by giving control to local authorities were going to lose that were going from a board that is one third parents or carers a third community people and a third service providers to just an involvement panel sure start was never designed to be for every child but by spreading it much more thinly the parents here will become disillusioned and cynical because they wont get what they were used to also nearby parents who think theyre getting sure start in its new guise will get only of it so theyll be disappointed if you just set up nurseries youre not going to empower anyone it will end up like headstart in the us cities which is just welfare for working mums what kind of parents will we have if they are forced back into work with the lure of childcare pam roche volunteer coordinator sure start newcastle east and fossway i first began using sure start five years ago when my youngest daughter claire attended the playgroup it worked so well then because it responded to what people asked for the ethos has changed a lot now there is more emphasis on economic targets getting people back into work by proving childcare places and linking parents with jobcentre plus now we visit a woman whos just had a child and were saying how can we get you into work im thinking to myself is this really the best thing for the child we have plenty of parents who are no way ready or capable of working including asylum seekers who are not allowed to work one of the nurseries we set up pro vided flexible affordable childcare for people like me to volunteer and to go to visit other projects but now they charge if youre working you get child tax credit but if youre unemployed like i was its not affordable there are a few free places i didnt think sure start was for people who were working im a bit disappointed but i know it has to sustain itself when claire started school she was more confident than my four other children who didnt have sure start it was good for my husband to have a break from looking after her and fantastic for me as i became a volunteer and then got my first job its scary to think the money will no longer be ringfenced when childrens centres are set up in and the money moves to the council it may decide it doesnt want to keep the staff here how committed local authorities will be to parent involvement we dont know val floy chair east birmingham sure start ive been working in the voluntary sector for years sure start really is a multiagency approach with parents and statutory and voluntary agencies outcomes to date include parents getting involved and building their skills going on training courses contributing to the board and management and improving their parenting i hope we dont lose those things weve gained so far childcare is a driver for this change it is important but we also need family support parental involvement and agencies to work together sure start is a holistic approach and it has taken a lot of time and effort to deliver this on the ground how the local authorities work with the sure start agenda on a local basis will determine its future i suspect it will differ a lot across the country i feel positive that birmingham council does understand some of the issues but at this very early stage it is a challenge for us all in sure start is to work with our local authority declan mcallister parent queens park sure start west london im the only fulltime dad here my wife works so i look after our three kids who are all under four i joined the management board about three years ago the parents had lots of discussions about what we wanted im really delighted with what weve got now everyday we go to three different activities before lunch baby gym arts and crafts and the library they are all in one building and its all free thats the amazing thing sure start wasnt around when my eldest was born so i had to take her to places that charged for one class once the money has dried up were concerned that the council will pull the plug it would be much more difficult to entertain the kids without sure start there are only so many times you can take them to the park and interacting with other kids is very good for them it means they adapt very quickly to nursery i have to get out for my own sanity and ive met lots of other parents through sure start it has given us a place to hang out and weve started to form as a community weve set up a babysitting circle a gardens group and ive joined the local neighbourhood and

margaret hodge our baby is thriving january is being disingenuous as norman glass pointed out surely some mistake society january surestart local programmes have not naturally evolved into childrens centres they are different concepts as indeed margaret hodge acknowledges the familycentred focus of surestart working with families to understand and take pleasure in their developing children has become a childrens centre emphasis on childcare places early education and integrated health and social care for children with particular needs of course these are all desirable but they are not the gentle and persuasive work with families in their own home or in groups at their own pace family support is more than just helping parents to bond with their baby its also about enabling parents to broaden their own horizons as carers surestart programmes were designed to be led by parents and the local community not every local authority is that brilliant in bringing parents and community organisations into decisionmaking surestart was originally announced as a year programme allowing for continuity and longer funding certainty now the same surestart monies are to be spread across wider geographical areas and subject to council yearly budget setting martin vegoda bristol as a parent of two young children who has spent many unpaid hours sitting on a surestart board and attending countless training sessions and conferences i was never under the impression we were being run from whitehall what surestart boards were given was autonomy over how the or so a year was spent parents had a real say with surestart professionals and local partners in how this money was best spent on families of young children particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds no more we have already been instructed to divert capital money away from community nurseries and playgrounds in favour of a hugely expensive childrens centre revenue funding is being tapered off early so why should i and other parents spend my time helping run a key part of the welfare landscape in the future name and address supplied over the past five years we have been involved with five separate government initiatives each with its own planning and evaluation systems despite our commitment to each one we are suffering from initiative overload this is why many welcome childrens centres a genuine attempt to learn from and capture all that is best from what has gone before the strength in labours strategy has been its commitment to highquality integrated early years services harnessing what has always existed in the lives of parents and many early years practitioners alike if this commitment continues to be given the support it deserves we will avoid the boardedup flyblown centres in years sharon hogan headteacher canterbury childrens centre bradford after years working in education i am as irritated as i guess gordon brown must be by the continual attempts to turn this governments work on attacking disadvatage into a turf war with tony blair this government has set out to do something that possibly no other government in the world has managed to develop a unified service to support all

i remember those wondrous moments when i first cared for my own babies and i remember the irrational sense of betrayal i felt when they quickly started to develop identities of their own this strikes me as precisely how norman glass feels about the coming of age of surestart surestart programmes began six years ago their aim was to provide onestop shops for families with children under four in the most deprived communities as one of surestarts architects glass should be congratulated but he is wrong to suggest as he did in the guardian this week that surestart is about to disappear indeed we want every family in england to enjoy surestart services by opening surestart childrens centres by of course the thinking has developed as we have learned how to improve outcomes for children and families if we now understand better what works to encourage breastfeeding to reduce postnatal depression to help parents give babies and young children healthier diets and to support them in providing creative and stimulating play we should share that knowledge across the country but the principles that underpinned surestart when it was conceived hold good we still believe that providing highquality services in childrens first days and years enhances their life chances we believe that building services around the needs of the child and breaking down the professional silos between health care early education and family support to offer in glasss words joinedup services leads to better outcomes empowering parents to support their children within theircommunities is the essence of surestart so what has changed contrary to glasss assertion what started as a familycentred programme has developed a clearer childcentred focus of course in the early days of a childs life the relationship between babies and parents is critical so investment in family support will remain central but some early surestart programmes failed to recognise the impact of high quality integrated education and childcare there is now powerful evidence showing that a good early years experience from the age of two can boost development particularly for the most disadvantaged by as much as months so we want surestart to provide it not as an alternative to family support and health services but as an equal part similarly we know that supporting poor parents into work is vital to lifting children out of poverty not when children are babies which is why we want to extend maternity pay to a year but when they are older so we want surestart to help unemployed parents into work to boost childrens opportunities we want surestart in every community because there are disadvantaged children in most communities but many challenges facing families transcend class mothers from many backgrounds can experience postnatal depression or seek goodquality early years education and care and they want all the services built around the childrens needs i agree with norman glass about the way surestart has empowered parents and strengthened community networks but to suggest that running childrens centres from whitehall is a better way of ensuring community ownership is laughable local authorities are much better placed to facilitate the involvement of local people they are locally elected and accountable and armed with local knowledge and understanding we stand a much better chance of maintaining real community ownership and enthusiasm by working through local authorities rather than running everything centrally when surestart launched it had a year life the first programmes had begun to experience declining funding but we have now ensured stability and continuity for all surestart childrens centres surestarts in deprived areas will enjoy more generous funding than those in affluent areas we will expect contributions from health education social services and jobcentre plus but surestart is here to stay on the welfare landscape this is not a smoke and mirrors commitment we have a realterms increase of each year over this spending review period i visit a surestart centre at least once a week parents tell me how much they love it how their confidence in parenting is strengthened how their selfesteem has been enhanced by the opportunities surestart gives them and most important how their children are doing better we want to capture that and extend it across the

hardpressed parents who rely on grandparents or other relatives to look after their children rather than pay professionals could damage their offsprings development research to be published next month in the economic journal reveals that richer families who use the unpaid services of their own parents would do better to seek highquality childcare the study also found that a childs development was not affected if their mother returned to work within months of giving birth as long as the childcare was professional nursery education could actually be beneficial for a childs development when compared with staying at home with a nonworking mother it found grandparents might fail to give the best care for many reasons including being out of practice since bringing up their children decades ago they might have outdated ideas on discipline and be physically unable to play with the young is early maternal employment bad for children the answer is generally no said paul gregg author of the study the effects of a mothers return to work using data on children born in the early nineties in avon which includes bath and bristol the study looked at how a mothers employment in the first three years of a childs life affected the childs learning and behaviour up to the age of seven it turns out that only those children from more advantaged households whose nonparental care consists solely of unpaid care by a friend relative or neighbour experienced significant detrimental effects said gregg who works at the centre for market and public organisation at the university of bristol the use of paid childcare seems to protect such children from any negative effects and attendance at a nursery may actually lead to better cognitive outcomes than for children at home with a nonworking mother around one in every four mothers who return to fulltime work within months per cent of all mothers relies solely on unpaid relatives friends or neighbours to look after their children short periods of care by relatives appear not to be damaging said gregg it is sole reliance on relatives that appears harmful other studies showing that mothers who returned to work in the first year after giving birth have children with poorer learning and behaviour were not adjusted to account for other risk factors for example if a mother works because household income is very low the study found any detrimental link between mothers working and childrens learning could instead be to do with the impact of poverty,2005-02,hardpressed parent rely grandparent relative look child rather pay

the women who come on the courses at the lewisham college trade union studies centre are women who work they are also mothers sisters grandmothers daughters partners nieces and granddaughters and they experience the full cycle of life while they are at work some employers have still not woken up to the fact that women are physically different from men and may have different needs when it comes to the clothing and equipment they use at work even after so many years of women in the workforce health and safety clothing is still geared to male physiques women can find these issues difficult to talk about if they raise them they are often ridiculed this can make women feel upset or depressed and worried about returning to work there are three biological functions specific to women menstruation pregnancy and breastfeeding that have implications for protective clothing and equipment at work personal protective clothing is not always available for parttime or casual work often it is designed for men and does not fit or has to be shared in its report gender issues in safety and health the european agency for safety and health shows how health and safety issues are often focused on men standards work practices and equipment take as the norm the body and size of the average male worker doing eighthour shifts for example women working in the ambulance service in some areas of london were asked to wear bulletproof vests many women found it enormously uncomfortable as the vests were made according to mens sizes and did not fit them comfortably around the chest illfitting work clothes can have severe health and safety implications for women clothing that is heavy tight or uncomfortable can hamper the way a woman performs at work thereby exposing her to health hazards women trade unionists are beginning to talk to manufacturers and employers to make these very points it is not uncommon to see that when protective clothing does not fit a woman or makes her uncomfortable nothing is done about it more often than not women end up not get any clothing at all which exposes them to all sorts of risks in the workplace working womens particular concerns are hidden because many safety reps and practitioners are male there is no real documentation and there are no statistics about womens accident or illhealth rates legislation in britain on occupational health and safety does not take gender into account on the assumption that workplaces suit all workers women are concentrated in socalled low risk industries where it is not deemed important that their work environments are safe the tuc takes the view that legislation and guidelines should not only benefit all workers but they should be gendersensitive they should take into account the fact that there are physiological and social differences between women and men the european legislation gives broad requirements for employers to provide protective equipment and clothing in practice what usually happens is that employers go for the cheapest option and buy the same clothing and equipment for everyone or they expect workers to share gloves overalls or aprons or they dont provide them at all as long as the employer does provide them it is complying with the legislation women workers are becoming a majority in the workforce they are also joining trade unions in larger numbers they are becoming union reps safety reps and learning reps and play a pivotal role in change in the workplace the students who attend our trade union studies courses at lewisham college are men and women who have been elected as union and health and safety representatives to find out more about women workers experiences the students are carrying out body mapping they are asking workforces to identify aches pains and illnesses on diagrams of the body then collating the results they are also devising department questionnaires and health and safety campaigns they are getting women involved as union safety reps and with talking to other women in order to make a real difference there is a blinkered view of womens health issues that puts them down to getting old or hysteria and reduces the incentive to do research we must encourage our trade union students to campaign to secure more funding for womens health services and research and to lobby mps and local councillors and write to health authorities at the launch of the new tuc working women book due to take place on february at downing street our students will be leading the way in promoting health and safety measures that

women civil servants earn less than their male counterparts according to new government figures which show the civil service pay gap is more than double the disparity found in the rest of the public sector at april the average gross salary for men and women was with onequarter of staff still earning or less figures released yesterday show the average salary for female civil servants compared to that of mens has decreased from in to last year despite equal pay reviews concluded by civil service departments and agencies in this compares to the pay gap in the rest of the public sector which sees women earn of the salary men take home and casts doubt on the governments professed commitment to tackling pay inequality the unresolved issue of equal pay has found a new lease of life recently as mps and even sectors of the business community are recognising the importance of pay parity across the gender divide in a bid to appease trade unions frustrated by the slow progress being made on this issue the government last year set up the woman and work commission under lady prosser to examine the gender pay gap which is due to report this summer mps on the department of trade and industry select committee have decided to preempt the report by carrying out their own investigations into occupational segregation which sees a dominance of men in certain betterpaid jobs and of women in lowerpaid occupations the perennial issue of pay inequality is also a key plank of the trades union congress s submission to next months budget in which it calls for funding flexibility so that ministers can implement equal pay and other negotiated settlements within their own departments business also joined the equal pay bandwagon today by calling on the government to do more to encourage companies to conduct equal pay audits to ensure there is no discrimination against women the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd claimed today there was a huge lack of awareness among employers about equal pay it said the government should work with employers to change mindsets and to make sure they recognised the business benefits of paying women the same as men firms were

for the cipd found charles cotton the cipd reward adviser said reward is becoming more and more important in helping employers compete in the war for talent as unemployment is so low many employers

if we worried in advance about the financial implications of having a baby it would seriously dampen that moment of passion luckily for future generations most of us tend not to let such thoughts get in the way similarly if we all thought hard about the financial implications of going back to work after having a baby many of us would not do it despite gordon browns rash of tax credits and vouchers designed to entice mothers back to work for a lot of women however they do their sums returning produces extra stress in their lives for little or no monetary gain despite the prospect of losing tax credits and facing high childcare bills the majority of mums do return to work albeit on a parttime basis for many according to the daycare trust charity per cent of mothers with a child under five go out to work rising to per cent for those with children aged between six and there is no magic income threshold that can tell mothers whether they are better off financially by working or staying at home it all depends on how many children you have how much you pay for childcare what benefits you qualify for how much you earn as a family and what else you hope to gain from returning to work some mothers will be influenced by other aspects such as parents who help with childcare or enlightened employers who ease their return with familyfriendly working practices many end up making the move for career development or independence from april things will get a bit easier mothers and fathers who have access to employersupported childcare schemes will get new tax incentives saving them an average of a year on childcare costs if they are toprate taxpayers and if they are basicrate payers although parents will still face big bills the reduction may be enough to swing the vote especially since the benefits are doubled if both parents have access to such schemes which are offered on a per employee rather than a per child basis in the meantime calculating whether it is financially worthwhile going back to work can be a tortuous process we have asked the citizens advice bureau and grant thornton to work out examples of parents on different incomes to give you an idea of how you might fare they show that many mothers will effectively be penalised on returning to work through lost state benefits and high childcare bills huge bills for high earners for higher earners the prospect of a small cash handout from the state is unlikely to influence a mothers return to the grindstone in most cases it is the huge childcare bills that are likely to swing the decision a new survey by the daycare trust charity shows that in inner london it costs an average a year to send a child under two to a nursery and to a childminder in the west midlands the cheapest region for childcare it is and respectively parents considering a nanny face more frightening sums according to nannytax a firm providing payroll services london parents typically pay a year gross for a liveout nanny plus in national insurance contributions asa nilsdotter of nannytax says taking into account that the parents must pay this out of their own taxed income a couple would have to earn just to cover this cost a single parent would have to earn because she or he will be in the higherrate tax bracket these parents will not be eligible for any state help with childcare even help for parents who are eligible for the maximum childcare element of the working tax credit is capped at a week per cent of the maximum in eligible costs the payments are per cent of for two or more children with no extra help for larger families in april the eligible amounts rise to and and from the amount contributed by the state will rise to per cent only accredited care such as nannies nurseries and childminders qualifies though some school play schemes may be included in some cases grandparents may qualify if they are accredited were still better off and go out sam bryant from earlsfield south west london gave up a wellpaid fulltime television job following a painful battle with her employer which wanted to make her redundant while she was pregnant with her first child millie now aged months sam who is marrying partner andrew watters a television editor in march says i went through hell and back and became very stressed i didnt want the baby to be harmed so i came to a mutual agreement with the company and left i was disillusioned with the industry and also realised the long hours wouldnt fit in with my new life especially with most nurseries closing at pm in the end when millie was nine months old sam found her perfect job as an office manager for working families a campaigning charity helping parents through the minefield of balancing work and home life sam says we pay a month for a nursery and i have to pay for travel were not entitled to any benefits other than child benefit as the income cutoff level is low especially in london but were still better off and can afford nights out together which is really important i found it cost up to a day carmin gunn went back parttime as a human resources manager after having her first child five years ago she is married to darren an aviation industry worker and they live in cambridge with their sons james five and alexander six months when i had james i started looking around for childcare and found that it cost up to a day she says i would only be a couple of hundred pounds a month extra better off another issue was that james suffers from allergies and i was worried about leaving him with someone i didnt know in the end she was lucky as her motherinlaw and aunt stepped in to take care of james for the three days a week she worked she says they are doing the same now for alexander i also feel fortunate i can work three days and still have a management job the couples joint income means they do not qualify for working tax credit so would get no help with childcare costs they only receive a small amount of child tax credit career progression and mental stimulation were as important as money although the cash has helped to maintain their lifestyle we moved to a threebedroom house which we couldnt have done had i given up work do the sums really add up in your case financially going back to work can cut both ways mandy smith who works at a citizens advice bureau in newcastle did the sums for an imaginary single mother with two children one aged under one who is a council house tenant receiving income support housing benefit council tax benefit and child benefit her total income is just over a week or a year if she takes a job on the minimum wage of an hour for hours a week earning a week or a year it would appear that she would has little to gain by working she will lose her income support but still gets some housing benefit and council tax benefit and will be eligible for working tax credit and child tax credit her costs will rise because she needs a week childcare for the baby though of this will be met through the childcare element of working tax credit so our mum ends end up with a new income of a week a week more than if she stayed at home smith says she is better off but her older child will no longer be entitled to free school meals with travel and clothing costs she would only be about a week better off she may wonder whether it is worth it mike warburton senior tax partner with accountants grant thornton says that women returners can benefit from a barrowload of tax credits so long as their income is modest but the decision to stay at home or to return to work can be borderline take a family with two children with the dad earning they cannot claim support for childcare costs as only one is working however they do qualify for child tax credit worth a year this tax year and next tax year assume the mum returns to work for hours a week earning a year and that they pay a week in childcare costs the family now qualifies for credits worth a year made up of child tax credit worth and working tax credit of though they get help towards the a year childcare costs they will only be a week better off when the mothers tax and national insurance payments are taken into account even if grandparents help with childcare the cost can still be high warburton picks a couple with two children where the man earns a year and the wife is weighing up a job paying it may seem there are obvious financial advantages but warburton says with just the father working the family would receive tax credits worth if mum goes back to work they will be left with just child tax credit a year going back to work parttime when your husband is earning a slightly higher than average salary could end up costing you more than you earn in a family where the husband earns and the mother gross net of tax and ni the family element is not tapered and is but assuming childcare costs of a week a year the family would actually be worse off with the mother going back to work the familys tax credit entitlement would not be increased unless the husbands income fell below if the same mother went back fulltime earning the family income would rise to their child tax credit entitlement would be tapered to x and because childcare costs would double to a week the family would be a year worse off,2005-02,worried advance financial implication baby would seriously dampen moment passion luckily

a fiveyearold whose parents earn more than has reading skills six months more advanced than one whose parents are jobless a governmentfunded study reveals that the gap occurs irrespective of natural ability parents education or how often mothers and fathers read to their child the children of those earning between and have an advantage of almost four months and of those with a joint wage of between and less than two months children whose parents earned income is between and are three weeks more advanced we have isolated the effects of an earned family income on a preschool childs educational attainment from their parents occupational status education level and home environment and have found that it has a profound effect said prof edward melhuish the m projects leader families with an earned income are more likely to be actively involved in society have a more stringent attitude to learning and higher expectations of their children we suspect that this advantage will become more extreme as the childs education continues added melhuish who is professor of human development at birkbeck college london teachers will assume that children who enter school already confident fluent and familiar with learning have great potential and will push them to achieve accordingly he said the observer spoke to one family with three children and a combined income of plus they live in a kent village the father works fulltime and the mother two days a week apart from the obvious things we do to help our children develop educationally our income allows us to give him lots of indirect advantages she said i make sure we go on as wide a variety of outings as possible and when we go on holiday we make an effort to give them experiences they dont get at home very few mothers in the village work fulltime and all of us are highly involved in our childrens lives she added a single mother with a daughter who will be five next weekend lives in east london and earns about a year working for a charity for lone parents i became pregnant in the third year of my degree course so i work hard to make sure my daighter realises how important education is she said it is definitely harder to do that on a low income but it is possible i am in a group that shares secondhand books videos and toys and take part in a local group that organises cheap educational trips no matter how much effort you put in however there are certain indirect benefits of a larger family income that children from a lowincome family will never have she admitted anne longfield chief executive of the educational charity children called the study a stark realitycheck it shows that the only way to level the playing field is to look at ways of providing extra child benefit and extra educational emphasise to disadvantaged children we have to accept those findings and work with them to bring the other children up to speed but schools have gone as far as they can go in raising literacy in normal school hours so now we need to work with families themselves and utilise the extra hours that wraparound schooling will provide the findings were welcomed by peter silva chief executive of peep the peers early education partnership which has just completed a sixyear study for the government on the impact of early education on lowincome families there is no doubt that income has a direct and an indirect impact on childrens educational achievements and if there is no intervention to change that then it becomes a very powerful and permanent influence he said it is however possible to devise

each year around women who are sacked made redundant or leave their jobs have one thing in common they are expectant mothers now the equal opportunities commission has launched a campaign that calls for urgent action to end unlawful treatment of working mothers the commissions pregnant and productive campaign forms a part of an investigation that uses the statutory powers under the sex discrimination act to gauge the depth of pregnancy discrimination in the uk backing the campaign is olympic athlete denise lewis who herself experienced problems with her coach when she announced that she was pregnant the commission is calling for two main changes to help employers and employees manage pregnancy at work more effectively it is urging the government to provide a written statement of maternity rights and employer responsibilities to every pregnant woman and it recommends giving employers a right to request that employees indicate their planned return date much earlier during maternity leave than they have to at present paul smith director at recruitment consultant harvey nash says women who feel they are being discriminated against should address the issue with their employer immediately in writing currently too many cases come to crisis point because of the poor lines of communication between employees and their employers the commissions drive is prompted by a new study released this week that quantified for the first time the number of pregnant women and new mothers experiencing discrimination in workplaces across the country the commission polled more than women who had recently given birth and continued to work during their pregnancy and also interviewed a further women with a child aged between months and years who were in full time employment during their pregnancy overall almost half the respondents said that they experienced some form of victimisation relating to their pregnancy a fifth said they lost out financially due to discrimination and one in were put under pressure to quit after they announced impending motherhood my employer told me that getting pregnant is disgusting and that im obviously not careerminded because i am pregnant reports one victim and another told the commission that i work for an organisation that seems to believe that having a day off for a hangover is pretty macho but taking time off due to morning sickness is a pain in the neck fiona cannon head of equality and diversity at lloyds tsb who is chairing the advisory board for the campaign says this is not a fingerpointing exercisenonreturning mothers have serious consequences for both employers and for women staff whenever a woman leaves her job because of pregnancy discrimination the employer loses her skills and experience and any investment in her training and women who take time out of the labour market may go into lower paid jobs when they return to work suffering financial disadvantage as a result after collecting relevant data the commission is expected to make recommendations to policymakers if you are an employer and would like to contribute to the eoc project email managingpregnancyeocorguk if

the number of childcare places available in england has increased by according to government ofsted inspectors in their annual report published today and almost all the variety of services from childminders to fulltime nurseries are providing either good or satisfactory services the report said the increase in places and improvements in the quality of care provided for preschool children were identified by ofsteds chief inspector david bell as some of the most important factors responsible for improvements in the education system as a whole but he also highlighted the continuing public debate about the appropriateness of children under two being looked after in day care and the amount of time that new parents should stay at home to look after their young children the choice of childcare was up to each individual family and was often influenced by economic factors he said he said i believe strongly that the government policy to promote childcare should be more than matched by support to enable parents to look after their children at home as is often the case in complex areas of social policy there is no clearcut answer but we can say with increasing confidence that high quality care and education for young children make a difference to their educational prospects the government should continue to invest in childcare but make sure that at the same time it was allowing parents real choice when making difficult childcare decisions about the youngest of our children he said the annual ofsted report revealed that up to september last year the number of childcare places was m more than a million were in day care while around were with childminders this was a increase in places since ofsted began its national database of childcare providers in march ofsted was being asked to register new childcare providers each year the report revealed mr bell said the numbers were significant and he was impressed with the efforts that the government has made to boost investment in this area in recent years he said overall there is a good story to tell with an expansion in quality being matching by improvements in quality the national childminding association ncma was delighted that more than half of registered childminders are providing good quality care according to ofsted its chief executive gill haynes said we hope that ofsteds report will persuade many more of the childrens centres and extended schools currently developing their childcare plans that registered childminding should be an integral part of the childcare service they offer local

early years coordinator calls it a distinct shift of emphasis others might call it a mini revolution among london boroughs enfield used to be known as an area where parents had few choices in childcare now it compares favourably with other outer london areas and wins good marks from inspec tors for the training it offers childminders and nursery staff over the past four years enfield more than exceeded the government target of creating new childcare places it created but that figure is put into perspective when one takes into account those new places that are no longer available because of nursery closure childminders changing jobs etc the net figure for expansion of childcare places in the borough is nearly a third under labours target the council also expanded its team of

a leading union today called for urgent action to tackle the chronic job segregation and undervaluing of the work women do in a bid to close the gender pay gap the demand came as research carried out for the gmb showed that women in fulltime employment worked around of the hours worked by men but only received of the pay once the difference in hours is taken into account the national gender pay gap is although it is as high as in london and almost in the east of england the union which won the first ever equal pay for work of equal value case revealed examples of workplaces with particularly high levels of job segregation and undervaluing of womens work they included a food factory where most shop floor workers were women and most managers were men a supermarket where most checkout staff were women and the majority of managers and drivers were men and a city of london financial services company where most cleaners and caterers were women and most brokers and dealers were men debbie coulter gmb deputy general secretary said that the analysis conclusively proved that job segregation and the lack of equal pay for work of equal value accounts for the lions share of the pay gap action is needed from employers and throughout the education and skills provision system to end the chronic job segregation and the undervaluing of the work that women do she said this exists throughout british industry and is accepted as the norm in most of the private sector ms coulter added that there were ways of addressing the pay gap imaginatively and progressively as is the case in areas of the public sector she said that traditional barriers were already being dismantled and greater equity was occurring among professional groups such as doctors and solicitors we would urge employers to work with unions to identify the reasons for the gender segregation within their workplace to agree strategies for eradicating gender pay imbalances and for providing equality of opportunity for half of britains workforce she said,2005-03,leading union today called urgent action tackle chronic job segregation undervaluing work woman bid close gender pay gap demand came

if you are a parent you may feel you need a degree in maths to work out whether you are better off after the budget especially if you are unsure whether or not you are entitled to benefits such as child tax credit ctc in the first place you can take the strain out of doing the sums by completing a questionnaire at wwwinlandrevenuegovuktaxcredits to see if you qualify for ctc and the childcare element of the working tax credit wtc as a benchmark families with incomes of less than should feel the most improvement their income tax bills should be offset by credits according to the chancellor the good news is that the child element of ctc is going up in line with earnings rather than inflation for at least the next three years from april ctc rises from to a year however the extra cash offered to a child in its first year of life known as the baby element stays at families entitled only to ctc and not wtc will be able to earn more before the benefit is whittled away from april the first income threshold rises by to ctc is limited to for families on incomes between and a year and disappears entirely after from april lowerincome families eligible for the childcare element of wtc will be able to claim per cent of costs on a maximum weekly childcare bill of for one child or for two or more children citizens advice welcomes the increases but warns tens of thousands of families have received tax credits but due to mistakes or a change in circumstances have been asked to repay hundreds or even thousands of pounds other childlinked changes confirmed last week include an inflationlinked increase to the weekly child benefit up by pence to for the first child and by pence to for other children the benefit will also be paid to youngsters up to the age of in fulltime

twothirds of parents still rely on family and friends to look after their children despite the governments efforts to increase the availability of affordable childcare the childrens minister margaret hodge admitted today while would prefer to put their in nursery or daycare many are concerned about the quality of childcare staff and services said the minister a third of the parents surveyed by the government said their main concern was how well qualified childcare staff were with reporting this as one of their top three concerns nearly four in said facilities not being up to scratch was one of their main three worries a quarter reported that childcare arrangements did not fit in with their working lives but mrs hodge predicted the governments year childcare strategy would lead to greater use of professional childcare speaking at a childcare seminar organised by thinktank the social market foundation the minister said more parents would choose this option as the quality and range of services available grew mrs hodge said childcare is seen as a big problem for almost everyone regardless of their personal circumstances and most people want these issues tackled as a priority if we do not develop universal childcare and early years services choice will remain a perpetual postcode lottery rather than evolving into a universal entitlement just under twothirds of parents surveyed thought that the responsibility for organising childcare should be shared by both parents and considered it should be the responsibility of the father mrs hodge said this signalled a welcome change in

new mothers cannot afford to take the government up on increased statutory maternity leave a union said today a survey carried out by the union of shop distributive and allied workers usdaw showed that of women with new babies would have liked to have taken more time off but instead were forced back to work on average six weeks before the end of their statutory maternity pay ran out under current law women can take up to weeks statutory maternity leave regardless of how long they have worked for their employer the first six weeks are paid at a rate of of average basic earnings although some companies choose to pay more after that for the following weeks the statutory rate of pay is currently a week women who have worked for their employer for longer are entitled to a further weeks leave usually unpaid according to usdaw two thirds of those women returning to work after having a baby said they couldnt afford to stay off any longer the union said that the average cost of taking the full months off work came to more than most of its members could afford thats a huge sum of money for our members to lose and is what most families actually spend paying their household bills every year so this is the kind of financial blow that many low paid workers will take years to recover from says john hannett usdaw general secretary our members have demanded we tackle this issue and were determined to get them a better deal thats why we welcome government plans to extend the length of paid maternity leave but we intend making the clear case for maternity pay to be increased the union said that with more women in the workforce than ever before it was time for employers to take the matter of pregnancy and maternity rights seriously the fact is that most women will need to take maternity leave at some point in their lives so we are focusing on how we make pregnancy and maternity leave a positive experience for every woman not just those who can afford it thats why we are making a strong case to government for better maternity pay and also working with progressive employers to develop maternity agreements that build on the rights government has already given mr hannett

the governments policies aimed at closing the gap between the pay of men and women have acted as a sticking plaster rather than a cure for the problem a new report claimed today the fawcett society which campaigns for equality said the government had not tackled the root causes of the disparity in mens and womens earnings increases in the minimum wage had helped many women but the reasons why women were paid less than men were not being fully addressed the report claimed ministers were accused of not being bold enough to close the gender pay gap completely women working fulltime earned around less an hour than men and this dropped to for parttimers while mens total income was almost twice that of womens said the report dr katherine rake the director of the fawcett society said we recognise that the current government has done much to improve the financial position of many women but womens income is still just over half that of men in the runup to this election in which womens votes are going to be so important we want all parties to take bold action and adopt gender equality as an explicit target the society called on political parties to set targets and dates for cutting the gender pay gap and to force firms to undertake audits to make sure women were not being paid less than men caroline slocock chief executive of the equal opportunities commission said the pay gap between the sexes is a disgrace there is no justification for women of equal ability and education to expect to earn nearly less than men but this is not just about fairness britain needs to compete and with women now making up nearly half the workforce employers are increasingly relying on womens skills to remain competitive more people are taking on caring responsibilities but fulltime work is still seen as the correct work pattern we need a rethink of policy and practice which matches how people live their lives with the reality at work until government and employers provide opportunities for people to balance work with caring education breaks down barriers to women in male careers and the law promotes good workplace practices that provide clarity for individuals and employers then pay differences will remain stubbornly high,2005-03,government policy aimed closing gap pay men woman acted sticking plaster rather cure problem new report claimed today fawcett society campaign equality

usually id be the first to applaud anything the government does to make life easier for working parents but extending maternity leave may not help many mums know even before they have their babies that they can take only a few months off if that without jeopardising their career or their familys financial position lets not even think about the per cent of men who say they wouldnt take paternity leave even if they were paid their full salary for those who return to work the real problems start when they try to find affordable and reliable childcare to fit in with their working hours the aweek childcare vouchers announced in the prebudget report are just tinkering around the edges compared with the cost of putting your baby in a day nursery or hiring a nanny domestic payroll service nanny tax recently calculated that the average nanny in london costs a year plus national insurance all paid for out of the parents net income that means a couple has to earn before tax just to pay the nanny companies are allowed to pay their employees out of pretax profits why cant the same rule apply to parents the financial services authority has faced a lot of flak this week according to the centre for policy studies the regulator is highhanded defensive and riskaverse these faults along with many others listed in a cps report could result in the fsa undermining britains competitiveness as a world financial centre but investors in two exeter asset management investment trusts specialist split cap trusts that invested in the shares of other split cap trusts may consider this a risk worth taking thanks to the investment trust industry successfully lobbying to stay outside the control of the fsa in investors who buy investment trusts shares directly through an executiononly nonadvisory stockbroker are not entitled to complain to the financial ombudsman or to claim for compensation from the financial services compensation scheme this means investors who bought shares directly in dartmoor or exeter enhanced income are left dangling but those who bought through exeters isa or savings scheme or on the advice of an fsaregulated independent financial adviser or stockbroker can at least complain to the ombudsman investors in similar investment trusts run by other management groups will get at least per cent of their original investment back through an fsaorganised scheme but the exeter trusts were excluded from this arrangement because the management company could not contribute enough money to the compensation package in contrast investors in unit trusts run by sister company exeter fund managers regulated by the fsa have already been able to complain to the ombudsman and may now be able to claim compensation from the fscs after exeter fund managers went into administration last week the issue of whether investment trusts should come under the remit of the fsa is again up for discussion in an outrageous display of cherrypicking the industrys trade body the association of investment trust companies is recommending that its members remain outside the control of the fsa but be entitled to take part in the financial ombudsmans

do we need more maternity leave last week the government announced proposed changes to maternity and paternity leave which if implemented will see mothers entitlement to paid leave extended from six to nine months by april the proposals will also introduce a right for mothers to transfer part of that paid leave to fathers while commentators and industry bodies have widely welcomed the changes many parents have told cash that they would rather see increased flexibility enabling them to take time off when their child reaches school age as well as help with childcare costs claire was in a midranking management job when she had her first child i took just three months off because i was worried i would lose the momentum in my career if i took any longer out she says the extension to maternity leave would not make any difference to me and the idea of my partner taking a month or so out of work is laughable he wont even take a day off if our daughter is sick what i would like is more help with the cost of childcare i work past pm and have to employ a nanny as a result this wipes out virtually all my salary access to quality childcare on return from maternity leave is an important factor in the decision to go back to work for many mothers according to a study by the department for education and skills in in a separate survey per cent of nonworking mothers said that flexible working options would be essential to help them back into work we welcome the extension to paid maternity leave and would like to see this taken to twelve months as soon as possible says stephen burke director of the daycare trust however we still need good quality childcare from the age of one up to the age of five and good quality childcare that wraps around school hours the government is moving in this direction but we will need further resources to be able to take this further jenny is the mother of two young daughters since returning to work she says that she has found childcare ridiculously expensive and in short supply im not sure the answer is more maternity leave plenty of working women are ready to go back to their jobs after six or seven months what stops them is dissatisfaction with childcare instead of spending more money on keeping mothers at home they should concentrate on the desperate shortage of skilled childcare at an affordable price those running their own businesses or are selfemployed are least likely to benefit from the changes they will be entitled to the a week maternity pay but most will feel pressured into returning to work as soon as possible the option to transfer chunks of paid maternity leave to the father is welcome though for many parents the a week would not be enough our research shows that the rate of pay has a major influence on whether or not fathers take paternity leave with less than half per cent saying they would take paternity leave at the current rate says rebecca clake organisation and resourcing adviser at the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd however at full pay the proportion of fathers saying that they would take pater nity leave increases to per cent the department of trade and industry hoped that per cent of fathers would take paternity leave but in fact only used their entitlement in the first year it was available according to the cipd four in organisations are already extending the right to flexible working beyond the legal requirements the nspcc for example offers paid parental leave to any employee with a child under the age of eight taken one week at a time up to a block of weeks extending to weeks for those with disabled children at present employers are not required to offer paid parental leave at all though they must offer a month unpaid to those with children under six david coulter the societys policy adviser on education and employment who himself works only school term times under the policy says its important people dont feel forced to go back to work because they cant afford to stay at home the main improvement would be to have more flexible leave robert lyall head of it at a publishing house in london and his wife tanya a selfemployed jeweller have a monthold son thomas robert took just a weeks paid paternity leave after thomas was born i couldnt afford to take any longer off work as my wife is selfemployed so was only receiving the minimum maternity pay he says i would have loved to have taken more time off work but i was shocked to learn that fathers are only entitled to just over a week tanya has now gone back to work and thomas has started going to nursery for two days a week the fees for which are almost a month robert says that while he felt it was important to spend time with his son after he was born he would also like to be able to take paid time off later in thomass life i think the main improvement would be if leave was more flexible parents should be free to take paid leave when a child is older as you never know when theres going to be a crisis many parents like us cant afford to do this hes settled but i miss my son when im at work naseem javeed a business service adviser with o gave birth to her son salahuddeen last september she took six months paid maternity leave but after considering extending this returned to work finances werent a problem i would have taken longer but was advised by other mothers not to because after six months the baby tends to become more attached making it more distressing for the mother and baby to be separated however she concedes that were the government to extend paid leave to nine months she would take advantage of this although i know my son is settled and happy during the day i miss him when i am at work her husband javed an itconsultant took two months unpaid leave to help naseem through a difficult time after the caesarean birth however naseem says that under normal circumstances he would only ever take a month off i wanted to be with her university research assistant polly russell and her husband steve rose a journalist have a weekold daughter millie polly is three months through a years maternity leave six months of which are unpaid i always thought id take six months leave because i couldnt imagine being at home any longer she says but as the time got closer to having the baby i realised i wanted to take as much time as possible to be with her the couple were in quite a good financial position to take the unpaid leave and polly also began saving once she had made the decision to take the year however she admits she hadnt considered any effect on her pension this is the first time ive even thought about it polly was able to freeze her research contract meaning that her employers did not have to find anyone else to fill her position it made me feel less guilty about taking so much time off,2005-03,need maternity leave last week government announced proposed change maternity paternity leave implemented see mother

the government is to break open the femaledominated world of childcare by encouraging men to work as childminders providing in the process male role models for singleparent families headed by women childrens minister margaret hodge will announce tomorrow that local authorities will have a duty to provide highquality childcare and create neighbourhood nurseries that would train super childminders getting more men involved in childcare is central to our strategy but it is going to be a huge struggle hodge told the observer childcare is traditionally a lowpaid job and widely seen as womens work involving men is vital for the growing number of children who are growing up in oneparent families without a male role model i want children to grow up believing there is no gender stereotyping of occupation men make up just per cent of all childminders john cawley a yearold former software consultant on the eurofighter and now a childminder agrees that it is a difficult career choice for men if someone told me when i was that i was going to be in childcare i would have laughed he said cawley left his job in it three years ago and set up a childminding business with his wife bernie in hertfordshire a family friend said i was wasting my education he would never have said that if id been a woman then it would have been considered a lifestyle choice but when you have a family and have developed the paternal side of your character it just seems obvious jackie turner an administration assistant and single mother who regularly leaves her fiveyearold harry and sevenyearold beth with the cawleys admits she was initially suspicious i wondered why any man would choose to do it she said it took me a while to get used to the idea but now i am delighted the children get a different sort of attention from john he takes them out to do all sorts of energetic stuff and they come back worn out i wasnt looking for a male rolemodel but its a wonderful offshoot to the arrangement harry loves spending time with him hodge will announce the creation of an extra childminding places by the end of for the super childminders a category she identifies as parents recruited by their childrens schools on to training schemes that could see them progress from childminder to teaching assistant to eventually teacher or health visitor increasing the professionalism of childcare will lead to better pay both of which will attract more men into the sector hodge said parents will become part of the school family training alongside teachers on inset days training days with a mentor in school to offer advice and support schools and child centres are a powerful recruiting ground for the army of people i know are out there who are ideal to work with children she said we just need to capture and support them there are around registered childminders in england though some are no longer working the workforce survey found that only per cent held a relevant qualification and just per cent held a level qualification in childcare we need to maintain and grow this workforce and their qualifications and super childminders will be key in drawing more parents into the profession said hodge the new strategy will be funded by the million transformation fund designed to provide more childcare provision free care for three and fouryearolds and care for older children outside school hours mark shepherd a yearold black briton and a registered fulltime childminder in lewisham believes it is a matter of time before men are common in the industry an increasing number of wives are earning more than their husbands so men are staying at home to bring up their children said shepherd who employs an assistant to help him look after seven children under five once they have that experience they realise that despite what society has told them about men not being able to look after children they can do it and do it well five years ago no parents would have trusted me to look after their children but now my business is thriving its my perfect job,2005-03,government break open femaledominated world childcare encouraging men work childminders providing process male role model

the governments plan to offer all parents with children aged five to affordable schoolbased childcare by year is in danger of being derailed by a lack of trained professionals next tuesday margaret hodge minister for children young people and families will address a oneday symposium at the barbican centre in london on developing a childcare workforce in total the government has created m childcare places since in a wide range of settings including nurseries and afterschool clubs on top of that there are now more than sure start childcare projects in the most disadvantaged communities in the country rewind to the budget in when chancellor gordon brown promised legions of childminders to cope with proposals for a rapid growth in childcare places critics say that seven years later and the government is still searching for a solution next weeks conference chaired by stephen burke director of the daycare trust will hear from the minister about plans to reform the childcare workforce she will identify the challenges and barriers to developing the childcare workforce and explore how to offer more attractive pay to recruit and retain staff poor training and low pay have created significant recruitment and retention problems we have a long way to go to provide the kind of skilled experienced and well rewarded workforce which is a necessary precondition of universal and high quality childcare provision was the conclusion of wouldbe labour mp ed balls who was formerly chief economic adviser to the treasury in a lecture given to the daycare trust earlier this year mr balls said as a parent for over five years i have now had direct experience of a number of different nurseries and i have visited many more nurseries and in fant schools i have seen both the professionalism dedication and hardwork of the staff on those nurseries both in the public and i the private sectors but also the fact that they do not have parity of pay treatment or esteem with teachers even though for parents and children the job they do is often as demanding and as important according to daycare trust research the workforce is predominantly white female and young salaries vary according to location and employer and also depend on the hours worked starting salaries for qualified nursery nurses are likely to range from to rising to around in london and nursery nurses in management roles earn between and a year little wonder then that four out of five childcare providers cite recruitment as a barrier to the delivery of high quality childcare frances ogrady tuc deputy general secretary who will be speaking at the conference says many childcare workers earn little more than the minimum wage those working in nurseries are mainly young women who can only survive on the low wages for a short time before leaving for better paid jobs outside the sector so staff turnover in many establishments is high childcare workers should be paid a salary that reflects their value and worth to society and unions need to make the recruitment of childcare workers a priority if the status of this vital group of employees is ever to improve unions need to work towards

government plans to allow women to transfer some of their maternity leave to fathers should be scrapped because they reinforce the assumption that it is the mothers natural role to care for a young child according to the uks sex equality watchdog in evidence to ministers consulting on rights for working parents seen by the guardian the equal opportunities commission argues that the plan undervalues the role of fathers in the care of young children instead of giving mothers the option of handing over some of their months leave entitlement only half of which is paid the government should replace the second six months with paid shared parental leave to be divided as couples choose the commission says it also wants the current two weeks paternity leave paid at a week to be extended to four weeks a daddy month paid at of earnings up to a fixed amount because at present too few fathers can afford to take it in its submission to the department of trade and industrys consultation working families choice and flexibility which ends tomorrow the watchdog says the eoc believes that after the physiological need for the mother to have time with her child for reasons such as breastfeeding after the first six months society should not assume it is the mothers natural role to be the carer under current arrangements children can lose twice over receiving less income from their mother and less time with their father the commission says adding this is not about forcing dads to be mums but making sure that government policy doesnt dictate the options open to families the consultation covers proposals intended to give working parents more paid time off with new babies and extend flexible working options to parents with older children or workers caring for disabled or elderly adults as well as promising to extend the duration of the aweek statutory maternity pay from six months to nine from and to a full year by the end of this parliament the government is consulting on allowing mothers to transfer part of their pay and leave entitlement to fathers ministers have asked whether this should be permitted from as early as two weeks after the birth of a child or at three or six months after the start of maternity leave the choice and flexibility document quotes surveys saying fathers want to be more involved in bringing up their children as well as research indicating that where a mother works during a childs first year and the father has more input in bringing up the baby this can lead to strong positive educational effects later on in the childs life but julie mellor chair of the eoc said transferable maternity leave still makes the assumption that the responsibility for caring for the child is the mothers any changes need to be underpinned by the principle of an increased chunk of time for fathers recognising the important role they play to their child to their partner and to the health of their families whilst also contributing to a modern and dynamic economy transferring leave meant the four out of fathers whose partners were not working during pregnancy and therefore were not eligible for leave would miss out

all too often the job title of nursery worker conjures an image of a wellmeaning amateur who has learned many of the skills on the job for years the work has been undervalued underpaid and underfunded its low status has made it an unattractive proposition for graduates looking to forge a career in child development but all this could soon change under bold plans to create a worldclass childrens workforce and adopt a european model of an earlyyears worker in what is being hailed as a potentially radical transformation of childcare two new models are being considered by the government which wants childcare to become a fullyfledged profession not merely a vocation the first model is the most radical and draws on danish experience where an holistic approach is taken to care and education by the rather unpromisingly named social pedagogues whereas in english the word pedagogue often carries an image of a pedantic academic in continental europe its meaning is much wider and embraces a concept of upbringing involving social and emotional development across denmark social pedagogues are the main workers in nurseries and other childcare settings and their training typically involves a three or fouryear degree with courses covering behavioural sciences working with conflict promoting teamwork and subjects aimed at building selfesteem the other option being looked at is a new specialist teacher trained to work with children up to four in nurseries and other care settings babies and toddlers in day care and nurseries in new zealand and spain are overseen by teachers specialising in the development of the very young these new professional roles have been put forward as part of the longawaited childrens workforce development strategy which sets out the governments plans for reforming childcare childrens social work and foster care the strategy which concentrates on the early years is aimed at strengthening the childrens workforce and making it easier for people of different professions to move within it under the proposals there would be an earlyyears professional in each of the childrens centres planned by this would be followed by a professional in every full day care setting across england by the document also offers a longerterm vision of an earlyyears professional in every foundation stage preschool setting there are currently private voluntary or independent preschools not headed by qualified teachers the daycare trust charity says such reforms are long overdue a research study involving nursery children has shown that youngsters do better if staff include a qualified teacher which is often not the case in private voluntary or independent nurseries according to daniela deale the charitys policy officer and campaigns manager further some of nursery workers are currently educated only to nvq level we know that the skills and qualifications of staff are paramount to achieving successful outcomes for children says reale the charity believes that of the childrens workforce should be graduates with the remaining educated to at least nvq level reale says serious consideration should be given to developing the role of a social pedagogue in the long term this would result in a focus on the child as a whole person with the practioner seeing herself in relationship with the child rather than in a separate hierarchical domain most childcare experts agree that introducing such a radical model of childcare would be an enormous challenge if the governments time frame was to be met a more feasible alternative would be creation of a new teacher specialising in child development of unders foundation degrees in childhood studies already exist and postgraduate certificates in education could be tailored to cover early years within months one man who will be closely involved in the development of britains new childcare professional is ralph taberrer chief executive of the teacher training agency who will work with the childrens workforce development council he believes in a mixed workforce and says it would be possible to create an adapted model of teaching based on existing models however he says the role of a social pedagogue should be fully explored this is a good opportunity for us to work out how through a series of measures we can further improve the quality of the earlyyears workforce says taberrer by experimenting with other approaches and properly testing them we can definitely raise our game david hawker chair of the association of directors of childrens services describes the proposed new ways of working as very exciting but he warns that it will be crucial for there to be adequate funding although the government has earmarked m a year he believes more will be needed if there is to be a real revolution in childcare if we are to have a graduateled profession salary levels must match the status says hawker what we need to do now is think about the next generations this is a fantastic

following todays confirmation of plans to extend maternity leave to nine months business leaders have called on the government to offer more help to the owners of small companies labours parental rights bill will entitle working mothers to an extra three months paid maternity leave in addition mothers will be able to transfer some of their maternity leave and pay to the childs father the legislation could come into force by april currently mothers are legally entitled to six months paid leave consisting of six weeks at of salary and the remainder at a week the new bill will mean an extra three months leave for mothers paid at a week the federation of small businesses fsb is calling on the government to help small business owners deal with the process of replacing staff on maternity leave stephen alambritis head of parliamentary affairs for the fsb said that absence is costly and difficult to manage for many smaller employers who do not have the resources of a large company all absence costs and we are calling on the government to provide a bespoke replacement service for small business employers he said smaller employers can cope with covering maternity leave for six months and often manage by calling on other staff to pull together and taking on additional duties but when leave is extended for another three months or a year this can be injurious to the business and to those other staff sourcing a replacement by recruiting in the marketplace is expensive the government should help small businesses to find a replacement staff member through the use of jobcentre plus offices the confederation of british industry cbi agreed that small businesses would struggle with the extension of maternity leave and suggested that the inland revenue should take over the administration the cbi also said that companies should be given more notice of when a parent expects to return to work so that employers can better plan extending familyfriendly rights to this extent threatens to make life extremely difficult for small firms said deputy director general john cridland to overcome this the government has to give more notice of return to work and give employers the option of handing administration back to the revenue maternity leave notification periods must be improved as current arrangements leave too much room for uncertainty mr cridland said that that the notice period for returning to work should be increased to three months and that employers should to be able to contact mothers during maternity leave to confirm when they will be returning to work susan anderson the cbis director of human resources said that plans to share maternity leave between parents could cause an administrative nightmare keeping track of which parent was exercising which right would potentially pose an administrative nightmare and it would be unreasonable to expect firms to police this system she said the government must present business with an easy administration system to coordinate shared maternity leave,2005-05,following today confirmation plan extend maternity leave nine month business leader called government offer help owner small company

a mother who fought a nineyear court battle for higher maternity pay won victory yesterday in a landmark case that is expected to affect thousands of women michelle alabaster won just plus interest in maternity backpay from her former employer after almost years during which her case moved from an employment tribunal to an appeal tribunal then on to the european court of justice and an appeal court in london yesterday she said she had persisted with the battle so as to correct the underpayment on principle to ensure that women on maternity leave got their rightful pay pregnancy is a really expensive time for new mums and it is hard making ends meet i am proud that i have fought for what is right she said thousands of women will benefit from what i have done mrs alabaster from bexleyheath kent started her case against the woolwich building society which is now owned by barclays bank in while pregnant with her daughter ellie she claimed that her employer at the time broke the sex discrimination laws of europe by underpaying her during her maternity leave though she had had a pay rise shortly before going on leave from her job as an administrator her maternity pay did not take the rise into account instead the building society followed government regulations which calculated her maternity pay based on her wages over a twomonth period earlier in her pregnancy before the pay rise the european court ruled in mrs alabasters favour in march last year and the court of appeal yesterday found that the judgment also applied in english law allowing her to receive the judgment means that all new mothers will now have any pay rise awarded up to the end of their maternity leave taken into account when their maternity pay is calculated the case also closes a legal loophole in the equal pay act that has effectively prevented women on maternity leave from bringing equal pay claims because of having to find a male worker with whom to compare pay julie mellor chair of the equal opportunities commission which supported the case said mrs alabasters nineyear marathon battle to claw back a pay rise she was due in her maternity pay sets a precedent for women bringing equal pay claims whilst on maternity leave this case demonstrates that britains equal pay legislation needs an overhaul in a report published earlier this year the eoc said up to women were forced out of their jobs each year because of pregnancy discrimination with one in five mothers interviewed in a survey saying that they had lost out financially at work through their pregnancy the maternity alliance which had supported mrs alabasters case from the outset yesterday hailed the ruling as fantastic the alliances head of policy ruba sivagnanam said this will affect lots of women who want to challenge decisions to exclude them from pay rises as well as employers having regard to it when they look at pay rises for their workforce this shows the equal pay act needs to be updated to really look at maternity leave which needs to be treated separately and differently mrs alabaster who has not returned to paid work and now has a second daughter darcie seven said she had always been motivated by a desire to see a change in the law rather than to gain financially somebodys got to take a stand and say no you cant do that and it just happened to be me her older daughter had already offered suggestions for ways to spend the money she revealed ellie wants to buy enough books to start a library and a trampoline and a bag of marshmallows a spokesman for barclays declined to comment

one million women workers in britain could find themselves sacked bullied or demoted over the next five years just for becoming pregnant a report warns today a twoyear investigation by the equal opportunities commission suggests that every year almost half of the pregnant women in the uk experience some form of disadvantage at work simply for being pregnant or taking maternity leave of that number are forced out of their jobs entirely missing out on m in statutory maternity pay the study claims despite the high levels of discrimination identified by the report but challenged as exaggerated yesterday by the employers body the cbi most women suffer in silence the eoc says seven out of pregnant women who are treated unfairly by their employers do not speak out fewer than one in seek advice and only about of those who lose their job seek financial compensation at an employment tribunal the eocs report greater expectations argues that employers and the uk economy are also losing out as a result of pregnancy discrimination it finds that replacing women sacked for being pregnant costs employers m every year while those who have been unfairly treated are far less likely to return to their old jobs damaging britains longterm productivity with women now making up almost half the workforce and with most returning to work in some form after having a baby the study suggests employers and female workers are united in an unprecedented desire to tackle the problem though it stresses the discrimination faced by some women its recommendations bow to the concerns of employers that strengthened maternity rights allowing women to take up to a years maternity leave can make business and human resources planning difficult and that very small businesses can find managing maternity leave difficult and expensive it urges the government to ensure all pregnant women are given a written statement of maternity rights and responsibilities at their first antenatal visit with a tearoff copy to hand to their employer but the report also proposes giving employers a green light to ask women to give a clear indication of their planned date of return from maternity leave where possible and it calls for greater government support for business in dealing with maternity leave arrangements businesses with fewer than employees should be given financial help and other small employers should have access to human resources advice the study says jenny watson acting chairwoman of the eoc said levels of maternity discrimination remained shocking it was time for honesty about the scale of the problem she said employers particularly small businesses need more help in managing pregnancy at work if they are to reap the benefits of retaining pregnant staff the trade and industry secretary alan johnson said while the report shows that the vast majority of employers understand and see the need for the fair effective legal protection that already exists those few who treat pregnant women unfairly are breaking the law and damaging their businesses the government has been consulting on proposed new maternity rights likely to see paid leave extended from six to nine months by and has already made clear it wants to balance the improved rights with a greater onus on women to keep in touch with their employers while on leave and give plenty of notice of their work plans businesses are keen to see employers given the right to ask women about when they plan to return to work though some maternity and worklife balance campaigners fear undue pressure being placed on new mothers susan anderson the cbis director of human resources policy said most employers are trying their level best to accommodate the needs of pregnant employees and illegal discrimination is not nearly as widespread as this report suggests but some companies are clearly lacking the practical support they need to help expectant women and will warmly welcome the recommendations that the eoc

the government plans a fivefold increase in the number of male childcare workers to help realise its plans for dawntodusk schooling national advertising campaigns tailored to men and maleonly training courses will be used to recruit the extra staff needed for the move announced last week by the secretary of state for education ruth kelly that will enable schools to open from am to pm by around new childcare workers will be required to provide pre and afterschool supervision but some warn there will have to be a massive shift in public attitudes towards men working with children to encourage more men to apply once men have joined the childcare workforce they tend to stay just as long as women it is persuading them to make the step of joining in the first place that is the massive hurdle said charlie owen from the thomas coram research unit coauthor of men in childcare the image of the profession as womens work is the biggest hurdle compounded by the failure of careers advisers to suggest it to young men and the fear of accusations of abuse many local authorities are already planning to attract men through imaginative campaigning such as advertising at football matches and by organising free menonly seminars mentoring sessions and road shows with slogans such as men who dare childcare and coolcare some of the campaigns already attempted however have proved unsuccessful fewer than five men contacted the authorities in hereford recently after the council placed advertisements for male childcare workshops around the local football club at present there are nearly people working in childcare and per cent are women said a spokesman for the department for education and skills even in the most progressive childcare countries such as denmark and sweden men only make up around per cent of the childcare workforce nevertheless this is a figure which we aspire to we will run a campaign to attract more staff into childcare and we will be especially appealing to men it will be emphasising how much men have to offer the sector needs to draw on a wider pool of talent if it is to ensure that children receive the best quality earlyyears provision a diverse workforce enhances childrens experiences and raises their awareness of others as role models this is especially important given that many children are living in a family home without their father the target has however been rejected by some politicians for not being ambitious enough the extended schools are an excellent opportunity to involve more men and having quotas is a great way of achieving that said keith vaz mp for leicester east an excellent target would be per cent but we should not accept less than one third jack osullivan cofounder of fathers direct points to the failure of the previous government target of tripling the number of male childcare workers by when they failed to reach that target people realised how massively we are going to have to rethink our employment policies if this is to become a reality he said but it is definitely possible to achieve this target with men being more involved in bringing up their children many are realising that a career in childcare is something they could enjoy daniel brand works as a nursery assistant at the play pit nursery in felixstowe suffolk he believes many more men would come forward if they were approached in the right way more men would be interested in it than currently dare to come forward if they could be persuaded it isnt a girls profession their mates will laugh at he said i couldnt be happier though

the uks long hours culture is damaging workers personal lives and reinforcing the gender pay gap trade union leaders said today ending the uk optout and limiting the working week to hours is crucial if parents are going to be given a greater choice of how to balance their work and home life according to the trades union congress tuc currently it said long hours were forcing women to juggle paid work with looking after children and older relatives while their partners work the longest hours in europe in its submission to the governments consultation on flexible working the tuc accuses uk bosses of being obsessed with the need to work long hours it welcomed many of the new rights for parents that have been introduced but said they are merely a sticking plaster over a much bigger problem the best way for employees to achieve a better worklife balance would be to give everyone the right to work flexibly it said this would mean allowing all carers and parents of children under to ask their employers for changes in the way they work and this could be supplemented with a change in the rules surrounding parental leave so that the weeks unpaid leave parents are now allowed to take during the first five years of their childs life could be taken at any time until a child reaches their teens addressing the issue of leave for new parents the tuc said mothers should receive of earnings in the first six weeks of their maternity leave as opposed to the current rate of this would boost household income and allow many mothers to extend their leave it also recommended the introduction of earningsrelated paternity leave and increased flexibility on when the leave was taken currently fathers are allowed two weeks immediately following the birth during which time they are paid a week it argued that the low level of payment is putting fathers off exercising their right to leave a lack of childcare choice was restricting the options for parents and forcing many families into a shiftparenting system where both parents work but at different times leaving one at home to look after the children the tuc said it called for greater investment in childcare to increase the number of places available the organisation said although of parents had had their requests for a change in the way they work agreed to by their employers many experienced an increased workload or demotion as a result it called for a strengthening of the law so that employers can only turn down requests for flexible working if there is a genuine reason to do so and must put that reason in writing the business benefits of flexible working are there for all to see said the tucs general secretary brendan barber apart from the obvious impact on the individual parent who feels less stressed and more in control of their lives more motivated employees are also more productive ones increasingly people are balancing the demands of caring not only for children but also dependent adults and these workers need support and protection but long hours working is the biggest demon facing uk workers many fathers find themselves spending extra hours at work when they would really rather be at

men are deterred from getting involved in childcare as fathers or workers because playgroups and nurseries are dominated by women a report published today says a study prepared for the government into the drastic shortage of male childcare workers suggests that fathers are caught in a vicious circle and would be more inclined to play a bigger role with children if the workforce reflected a greater gender balance the mothers dominant role as gatekeepers to childrens care and upbringing can also deter some fathers from getting more involved in activities such as taking their children to playgroups the research by the preschool learning alliance found the study calls for more playgroup activities specifically directed at fathers and children including events outside typical working hours so that more dads can attend the report comes as the government tries to encourage more men to take up careers in childcare as part of a drive to expand staffing numbers to meet the increasing demand with the number of male nursery nurses stuck at just for the decade up to and the same proportion of male staff in playgroups and preschools david blunkett the work and pensions secretary said yesterday that boosting that number would benefit both children and men it is important for men to play a real part in raising children for the benefit of children fathers and society as a whole he said at the launch of national childcare week recruiting skilled people to work in childcare is a key priority but it is also important to get a diverse workforce to enhance childrens experiences and raise their awareness of others as role models from an early age the preschool learning alliance research covered some earlyyears playgroups and other settings as well as focus groups of fathers of children attending the groups and of female staff it found that when the dads did set foot in playgroups their role was often restricted to genderappropriate activities such as doing jobs or being involved in outdoor games or construction play where fathers came to a playgroup almost half stayed for less than minutes and threequarters for less than half an hour fathers tended to be content to see themselves as sup portive to their partners who are usually primary carers the report proposes that playgroups take account of fathers typical roles as the main breadwinners in the family unit and organise some activities outside of the working week such as on saturday mornings even if it means expanding traditional operational hours they should also be aware that fathers want to take part in not only traditionally male activities such as sports days but in a range of other nongenderspecific pursuits with their children as well the report strongly urges childcare providers to develop programmes and activities specifically targeted at fathers if they hope to secure their greater involvement the latest research like earlier studies suggests that the term parents is often read by fathers and their partners as meaning mothers the study says mothers should encourage such activities to challenge assumptions that men in earlyyears settings may pose a risk to children staff and volunteers in playgroups should undergo gender awareness training to help them move beyond traditional ideas of male and female roles in parenting the report says,2005-06,men deterred getting involved

david blunkett today called on men to consider a career in childcare saying that they had an important part to play in providing children with a positive male role model speaking at a sure start programme in south london as he launched national childcare week and sure start month the secretary of state for work and pensions said men had a real role to play in childcare mr blunkett said that men could benefit from the chance to look after their children while taking a step back into work he said that currently only of those working in childcare were men yet they had much to offer the profession and there was much they could gain from it it is important for men to play a real part in raising children for the benefit of children fathers and society as a whole said mr blunkett recruiting skilled people to work in childcare is a key priority but it is also important to get a diverse workforce to enhance childrens experiences and raise their awareness of others as role models from an early age mr blunkett went on to emphasise the importance of childcare services in helping single parents return to work good quality childcare can have a positive impact on childrens development improving both educational and social outcomes and is also essential to help break down the barriers that stop lone parents getting a job the government has already funded a substantial expansion in childcare in the private voluntary and public sectors with the creation of more than m new registered childcare places since and we pledged last year in the spending review to establish a network of up to childrens centres by so that all young children and families in the most disadvantaged areas have access to one there are more lone parents in work than ever before but im fully aware there is still much to do work is the best way out of poverty and it enables lone parents to set the best possible example for their children and helps increase their own selfesteem the sure start programme was set up by the government to increase the availability of childcare for all children and support parents who want to get back in to work particularly those in disadvantaged areas also present at todays event was the chief executive of the daycare trust susan crane whose organisation has launched a guide for employers designed to help businesses help their staff to have a positive

maternity leave should be extended to months and employers given more help to deal with the new rules a parents group said today in its response to the governments consultation on rights for working parents the maternity alliance backed plans to increase paid maternity leave from six months to months arguing that an extension would make current arrangements simpler and improve the legal protection available to women who opt to take weeks leave the alliance which advises around parents a year said increased leave is one of three main priorities for working mothers and fathers the other two are an increased rate of statutory maternity and paternity pay and more changes to flexible working rights maternity alliance called for the flat rate of statutory pay for parents to be based on a living wage or a womans average earnings if that is less flexible working rights introduced in april have brought improvements the alliance said but a number of changes were still needed that had not been addressed in the governments consultation paper for example parents with children under two should have an absolute right to return on flexible hours and employment tribunals should have the power to scrutinise an employers refusal of flexible work some business owners have criticised plans to extend paid leave and the maternity alliances response suggests that good practice guidance from the government on how to handle the maternity leave period would be helpful for employers the alliance also said regulations could be amended to allow employers to give holiday pay during or after maternity leave ros bragg head of policy information and campaigns at the maternity alliance said the rhetoric of choice remains pure rhetoric if there are economic barriers to making a choice for men and women on low incomes unpaid leave is an option they cant afford if we are to support choice for all parents it is essential that leave is paid and that it is paid at a rate which allows parents to take it up a fundamental element of any package of support for new parents must be a real right to flexible work too many parents are refused flexible working for bad reasons employment tribunals should have the power to scrutinise an employers refusal of a request for flexible work the government launched its consultation paper work and families choice and flexibility on february this year it is proposing to extend maternity pay from six to nine months from april working towards the goal of months paid maternity leave by the end of the parliament the paper also includes plans to support better dialogue between employers and employees during leave and plans to allow mothers to transfer some of their leave and pay to fathers,2005-06,maternity leave extended

most parents have to use childcare at some point but with fees rising at more than three times the rate of inflation families face soaring bills around one in employers offer some kind of help with childcare whether it be running an onsite crche or providing vouchers to help you pay fees hsbc for example runs a crche for its employees children the bank announced in april that it was doubling the number of places as well as offering childcare vouchers to parents who opt for other forms of childcare under the company scheme hsbc offers staff the choice of either nursery places or childcare vouchers or both instead of part of their salary a place at a staff nursery typically costs between and a day the new voucher scheme will not only allow more parents and carers access to subsidised childcare but is flexible says head of employee support sue jex parents can use our workplace nurseries or they can choose independent registered childcare but for those without an employer offering subsidised childcare the alternatives are costly minding the costs according to the charity daycare trust some parents are paying a week for a fulltime nursery place the average cost of a place for a child under two in england now stands at a week rising to in london the crystal day nursery in south london for example charges a day or a week for fulltime care of a baby aged three months to two years childminders are not much cheaper typically charging between and a week for a fulltime place and in some areas high demand for places pushes prices even higher a nanny is the most expensive option and you can expect to pay up to a week in wages on top of that as the nannys employer you will have to pay tax and national insurance for your employee however nannies can work out more costeffective if you have more than one child or can share a nanny with another family as unlike a childminder nannies are not paid per child elizabeth elder chairwoman of the recruitment and employment confederations childcare division says au pairs are cheaper but have no formal childcare training au pairs do not receive a wage as such she explains they come to the uk to improve their language skills and experience a new way of life they receive pocket money of approximately a week and effectively live as a family member which means that their food and accommodation is all paid for payment methods to help pay for childcare parents are automatically entitled to some benefits such as child benefit depending on their income they may be entitled to others such as the child tax credit and working tax credit in april childcare vouchers were introduced allowing parents to choose to have up to a week or a month of their gross salary paid in childcare vouchers a survey recently carried out by voucher administrator accor services showed that by the end of the year of organisations plan to offer vouchers to their employees currently it revealed they are available from of employers employees who claim the childcare vouchers dont pay any income tax or national insurance contributions on them this means standardrate taxpayers save the equivalent of and higherrate taxpayers the equivalent of this can add up to between and a year employers need to sign up to the scheme but it saves them money too as they do not have to pay tax and national insurance on the part of the salary paid in vouchers however critics of the scheme say it could leave some families worse off as the money saved by taking the vouchers could be offset in losses in tax credit payments other criticisms include the fact that high earners tend to benefit most and parents cannot use the vouchers to pay relatives or friends to look after their children only registered childminders tomorrow

employers who give parents priority when they allocate summer leave were today warned they could risk charges of discrimination in a survey by business support company croner six out of employees said they thought parents should be given priority when booking annual leave during school holidays a view shared by of employers however employers who give workers with children different holiday rights are risking allegations of discrimination from childless employees it may seem perfectly fair to organise peoples holidays on the basis of priority need but employers need to be aware of the potential problems said richard smith an hr expert at croner it is often the assumption that the mother will take the childcare responsibilities so they need priority some employers tend to take that paternalistic point of view so there is direct sex discrimination a male employee may complain about that mr smith said he thought it unlikely a claim would end up before an employment tribunal but that it was important for businesses to have a clear holiday policy the best tip is to be pretty neutral in policy and start from the position of a firstcome firstserved basis then it seems reasonable to say to the latecomer that they cant have the holiday because they did not ask first a firstcome firstserved policy is in place at the pr agency where single parent karen frost is employed she said her company does not give priority to parents but they are likely to be first to ask for leave people who do have school age children tend to get in early with holiday requests so they can take time off during school holidays to coincide with their children being off school we parents have to be a bit more organised and plan ahead before she had her daughter four years ago she said she tended to take her holidays outside school holiday times to allow her colleagues with children the opportunity to take time off six weeks summer holiday is a long time to find childcare cover for children if you cant take time off work most parents have to take time during school holidays and would relish the flexibility that nonparents have however adam brown a product marketing manager who does not have children said he felt an unspoken pressure to book holiday outside school breaks he said i know that if for whatever reason i need to take holidays off at that time ill need to use every trick i know to get round the issue although his company also offers a firstcome firstserved policy he said he had encountered problems particularly over the christmas break the period between christmas and new year is prebooked up in their minds not on paper by senior colleagues with children and theres no room for negotiation i have to come in to work to cover the workload despite my family living in london and me in the north i have no choice but to accept it david bishop spokesman for the federation of small businesses fsb said the summer holidays served to highlight a growing divide between parents and childless workers employers are increasingly seeing resentment in the workplace from nonparents because much of the employment legislation that has been introduced in recent years has been of specific benefit to families and working parents and not employees generally he said nonparents feel that they get a raw deal and would argue that there are pressures in their own life outside work thats difficult to manage for the employer who is working within the constraints of the law he added that answering holiday requests from workers can be particularly difficult for small employers who are well aware of their employees personal circumstances and could find it particularly hard to say no to a parent who wants leave it may be easier for the hr department in a big company to stick to firm rules because ultimately they dont have to share an office with the person they may be denying a request to,2005-07,employer give parent priority allocate summer leave today warned could risk

the schools inspectorate ofsted is to publish detailed reports of every childminder in the country so that parents can check how they rate the first reports were published today ranking each child carer outstanding good satisfactory or inadequate only childminders across the country have been called outstanding while have been labelled inadequate those given the bottom ranking include childminders who have failed to meet health and safety tests or have had complaints of physical abuse upheld against them but ofsted said those rated satisfactory would also be required to improve their services ofsteds director of early years maurice smith said this is a fantastic achievement by those who work in the childcare profession and go allout to provide a top class service whether they are a childminder or work in a nursery over one million children are placed with childminders and in nurseries every day so its imperative that parents have easy access to good information about the quality of care their children are getting the reports are from inspections carried out over the past year since ofsted was given the duty to inspect preschool provision the watchdog aims to have reports for every childcare provider up on its website by which amounts to inspections in total to prevent paedophiles finding out the location of childcare facilities the website will not tell parents the names and addresses of their local facilities instead parents will be able to type in their postcode and get results sorted by distance from their home for a fivemile radius they will then have to take the references from the reports they like the look of to their local childrens information service which will inform them of the location the inspections are being carried out without the centres having any prior knowledge so they do not have time to prepare mr smith added all providers will have the chance to shine during their inspections under the new framework i hope that todays outstanding providers will act as an inspiration for others we want outstanding practice to be common practice,2005-07,school inspectorate ofsted publish detailed report every childminder country

families in britain face bills averaging more than a week and as high as in some cases for their childrens daycare during the school summer holidays according to a childcare charity an annual survey of the costs of holiday care by the daycare trust published yesterday as schools prepare to break up for the summer revealed that parents whose children attend play schemes throughout the break can expect to pay on average per child for six weeks though costs have risen a relatively modest on average since last year the survey also indicated a shortfall in affordable and accessible schemes in many areas the findings of the study reflect a perennial problem with childcare in the uk which remains the most expensive in europe despite government efforts to improve quantity and quality holiday care is targeted for improvement under plans for extended schools open from am to pm during holidays as well as term time the most expensive region in england for daycare remains the southeast with costs averaging for a whole summer,2005-07,family britain face bill averaging week high case childrens daycare school summer holiday according childcare charity annual survey cost holiday care daycare trust published yesterday school prepare break summer revealed parent whose child attend play scheme throughout break expect pay average per child six week though cost risen relatively modest average since last year survey also indicated shortfall affordable accessible scheme many area finding study reflect perennial problem childcare uk remains expensive europe despite government effort improve quantity quality holiday care targeted improvement plan extended school open pm holiday well term time expensive region england daycare remains southeast cost averaging whole summer,"['family', 'britain', 'face', 'bill', 'averaging', 'week', 'high', 'case', 'childrens', 'daycare', 'school', 'summer', 'holiday', 'according', 'childcare', 'charity', 'annual', 'survey', 'cost', 'holiday', 'care', 'daycare', 'trust', 'published', 'yesterday', 'school', 'prepare', 'break', 'summer', 'revealed', 'parent', 'whose', 'child', 'attend', 'play', 'scheme', 'throughout', 'break', 'expect', 'pay', 'average', 'per', 'child', 'six', 'week', 'though', 'cost', 'risen', 'relatively', 'modest', 'average', 'since', 'last', 'year', 'survey', 'also', 'indicated', 'shortfall', 'affordable', 'accessible', 'scheme', 'many', 'area', 'finding', 'study', 'reflect', 'perennial', 'problem', 'childcare', 'uk', 'remains', 'expensive', 'europe', 'despite', 'government', 'effort', 'improve', 'quantity', 'quality', 'holiday', 'care', 'targeted', 'improvement', 'plan', 'extended', 'school', 'open', 'pm', 'holiday', 'well', 'term', 'time', 'expensive', 'region', 'england', 'daycare', 'remains', 'southeast', 'cost', 'averaging', 'whole', 'summer']",95
hearn becerras motto if your ears arent bleeding then its not real music will give you some idea of what his evenings are like he plays in a band that performs grindcore an extreme form of heavy metal his day job doesnt offer much aural relief the yearold south londoner is a playworker in an afterschool club and he admits to playing loud music to his young charges music and children go perfectly together he says both are about high energy i dont play them the extreme stuff just about as far as led zeppelin and they love it hearn hardly fits the image of a person who works with children for one thing only of those in childcare jobs are male though this proportion might be edging slowly upwards stephen dade who works in a nursery school as a parttime support assistant says he has started to notice that the number of men on courses he attends has risen slightly but significantly it wasnt uncommon a while ago to be the only man but now there might be two or three others but its not fast enough for the daycare trust a national charity that campaigns for quality affordable childcare it says public fears about paedophilia and the assumption that looking after children is womens work need to be addressed it has an ally in david blunkett secretary of state for work and pensions who believes men have a role to play in childcare partly as a way of helping some to get back into work it is important for men to play a real part in raising children for the benefit of children fathers and society as a whole he said as he launched the recent national childcare week it is also important to get a diverse work force to enhance childrens experiences and raise their awareness of others as role models from an early age becerra who recently completed an nvq level in playwork agrees that it is important for more men to work with children the area of south london where he works has a high number of single mothers and considerable social deprivation kids need a male presence so that they can be fully socialised and grow up to avoid getting into trouble he says they need positive male role models as many of the children i work with currently have very negative ones he finds the work rewarding and stimulating though he more or less stumbled into it i thought its a job it pays and im used to kids having younger brothers he says and after doing the basic courses i really enjoy it and im always learning from more experienced colleagues dade from st albans hertfordshire gave up a job in printing to spend more time at home caring for his young daughter before returning to work in a nursery school virtually all parents i meet are pleased to see a man working at the school he says the reason is mostly that they like the presence of a male role model he began on the nvq route but switched to a foundation degree in earlyyears education this will bring him up to senior practitioner status the public tends to view childcare as womens work he says that and perceptions about low pay probably dissuade some men who might consider it from taking on such a job and it is not generally an option offered to teenage lads unsure of what they want to do i dont think a careers adviser would even suggest childcare to an yearold male he says john cawley abandoned his freelance software consultancy to become a registered childminder working from his home with his wife in st albans he has done training right through to nvq level the husband and wife partnership is in constant demand he says we have a sort of unique selling point in that we provide two qualified childminders in family surroundings he says and we are now part of a network of childminders who receive extra targeted training such as in health issues becerra meanwhile believes his youth is a big advantage in this career i dont suffer from the kind of stigma that an older man might face he also sees it as a chance to prepare himself for fatherhood a consideration that is probably rare among men of his age i also get to try out my parenting skills on other peoples children while being supported by older workers what could be better,2005-07,hearn becerras motto ear arent bleeding

babysitting is where you volunteer to be left holding the baby babysitters do this because they think theyll see a lot more money than baby but before you rush into it ask yourself if the children are so lovely why are their parents so keen to get away there are two kinds of babysitting one involves reading magazines and eating chocolate the other is a form of riot control in which the kids will be up dressed full of energy and ready to rock often their first game is to persuade the babysitter that eating chocolate and watching the late movie is what they do every night tell them that a cold bath with a yard broom is what you do every night your host will usually leave out light refreshments for you its perfectly ok to munch your way through these but if you find yourself defrosting things youve probably gone a little too far teenagers are interested in only one thing when babysitting and that is intensive studying often theyre studying biology which requires practical examinations with their partner normally the babysitter is very well behaved its the partner who has just been released into the community under special licence the best kind of baby to sit for is a ninemonthold because it should sleep through the night and its parents will be so exhausted that their definition of a late night is between pm and pm some people say theyll be back by pm and still arent home by am if you want to go home give them a call to say that tabitha isnt sleeping and wants mummy very badly miraculously you will have got her back to sleep in the minutes it takes her parents to rush home at some stage during the evening you should check on the children this really means checking the house and having a good old nose its fine to pop your head through doors but this shouldnt extend to opening drawers booting up computers or pulling up floorboards babysitting rates are comparable to the fees of a large accountancy firm if you find yourself having to go without a starter on your night out so you can pay for the sitter youre probably being overcharged some precocious babysitters add expenses to the fee this is what they charge for eating your food and using

salary was more than that earned by female workers and even in northern ireland where the gap was smallest mens earnings were higher a spokeswoman for payfindercom cj brough said the report highlighted womens reluctance to ask for more pay this years payfinder report highlights that sex discrimination is still rife in the workplace she said women need to be diligent and take the lead in checking that their pay is fair and equal unfortunately the fairer sex do tend to shy from wage negotiations whereas conversely men often have no such reservations research conducted by the site in february of this year suggested that of women were too scared to ask the employer for more money compared with just of men a spokeswoman for the equal opportunities commission eoc said the figures backed up its research which showed the gender pay gap is unacceptably large and its not going away she said the eocs findings showed an gap between the salaries of men and women in fulltime work in favour of male workers and a difference in the hourly rates paid to parttime workers a figure that has remained the same for the past years the continuing pay gap was evidence that the current law has come to the end of its life she said it allows you to bring individual cases for discrimination but it doesnt look at the bigger reasons why this is happening rather than individuals take action she said the gap could only be closed with work by the government and employers to encourage women into higher paid jobs and allow the flexible working that would enable them to stay in work while raising

or nursery nurses beats the local girls by a long chalk i think guy davidson by email dont be such a tightwad good for them the babysitters in your area have clearly learned two really important lessons for life firstly that collective action achieves more than operating alone and secondly that taking responsibility for children is a valuable role and should be paid accordingly you should congratulate them and pay up but at the same time encourage them to earn that responsibility and their higher hourly rate by getting qualified to do the job many colleges now run short courses for babysitters teaching basic childcare first aid what to do in an emergency etc it might cost you a bit more you might have to go out a little less often but your children may be safer and their babysitter will be setting them a good example s campbell swindon its market forces speaking as a yearold teenage babysitter myself though an hour may seem steep we babysitters are like any other market and market rates apply also why not try boys though some could have reservations we can do just as good a job and may be less demanding patrick williamson essex can you put a price on your childs safety whether you believe your children are low maintenance or not is no excuse for paying your babysitter next to nothing i imagine like all parents that your children are the most precious

pennypinching as the mother of a son who regularly babysat for several professional families i was frequently amazed at the pennypinching that went on when parents returned home in the early hours often after spending a small fortune at a smart restaurant or the theatre the responsibility of looking after children even low maintenance ones should not be undervalued if the local girls are worthy of this responsibility then an hour is surely a small price to pay anne falgate norwich look to the older generation i think an hour is a lot of money to pay someone lacking in childcare experience

the friday playgroup at the talacre community centre in kentish town north london is busier than ever but there is not a mother in sight instead men are playing with their children and changing nappies eighteenmonthold oliver and his father pete goldsmith are making sandcastles its unusual for him to be surrounded by men beams goldsmith it has a calming effect on him the goldsmiths are at caring fathers confident children cfcc a weekly dropin centre aimed at men run by social workers john black and rod de souza the project provides a space for fathers to come together and spend quality time with their children in an informal and supportive setting where the only rule is that no mothers are allowed black set up cfcc which is funded by sure start and camden and islington family service unit out of frustration with the lack of services for fathers i was hearing men complain that they felt excluded says black many men thought that local services were aimed solely at women i wanted to create a space where men could bring their children without having to feel out of place and where they could share experiences the project started two years ago just two men turned up at the first session black says today we have a core group of or so and about occasional visitors every month there are an estimated fathers groups elsewhere in britain family services are beginning to recognise that they need to adapt to meet fathers needs says jack osullivan of fathers direct the national information service de souza says it is up to us to make dads feel that their contribution is worthwhile he is encouraged by initiatives such as the childrens national service framework which requires primary care trusts local authorities and childrens services to provide targeted information and training to fathers furthermore in april the government launched the fatherhood quality mark a system that rewards statutory and voluntary agencies that meet these standards all this leads black to believe that the number of allmale groups is set to increase fathers groups are here to stay he says the atmosphere is very easygoing men dont feel judged they can make mistakes and not worry throughout the session black moves through the room chatting with fathers and playing with their children everybody gets something different from the experience he says some men just come to play with their children others will want to chat or ask me for specific advice andy chipperfield brings his twoyearold son to cfcc on his day off i go to other playgroups and im nearly always surrounded by women he says its refreshing not to feel like im the only bloke around black wanted to make the scheme as inclusive as possible i didnt want to identify men with particular needs such as teenage or single dads as that would have made it less welcoming to other men patrick holley a designer echoes this youll find all sorts here lawyers bricklayers musicians but we leave our egos at the door its about supporting each other sometimes dadstobe attend the group dwayne downie says i wanted to find out as much as possible about what to expect as a new dad i wouldnt have had that opportunity without this cfccs popularity owes much to blacks easygoing manner and unconventional marketing if i see a man with a buggy i stop him in the street and tell him about it he says i nearly always get a

government moves to end compulsory checks on carers including afterschool clubs playschemes and creches risk jeopardising childrens safety childcare workers fear the plans which ministers argue would lighten the burden of regulation for those providing only brief periods of daycare would be a backward step in a sector which has faced claims of poor quality according to campaigners and professionals working with children the government and the inspection body ofsted have been trying to ensure parental confidence in the expanding daycare sector by introducing a more rigorous inspection regime however while this would remain for care for children up to five and for any care provided by schools proposals outlined in the governments planned childcare bill would scrap current compulsory checks on provision for youngsters aged five to eight that means afterschool and holiday clubs and creches provided in the community would no longer be obliged to sign up to an ofsted register or to undergo inspections by the watchdog the head of the governments sure start programme naomi eisenstadt yesterday acknowledged that a consultation on the move due to close on october had provoked a very very strong lobby against doing this opposition had been so strong it was possible ministers would now back down over the measure she told a sure start conference in london but ms eisenstadt defended the planned reforms telling critics we are not deregulating we are going for a voluntary scheme the rationale for the change was to minimise unnecessary regulation around care for older youngsters she said this is about the difference between what is a few hours after school and a whole daycare setting it is also the difference between the ability of a five and sixyearold to talk to their parents about whether they like it or not as opposed to the ability of a baby or a twoyearold providers still faced other compulsory checks such as the requirement to conduct criminal records bureau checks on staff working with children and to comply with health and safety rules she said campaigners yesterday rejected her assurances daniela reale head of policy at the daycare trust said we feel this is taking a step backwards children between five and eight are still small and vulnerable and they need all the safeguarding it is possible to have anne longfield of children said we understand having a voluntary scheme for older children but six and sevenyearolds are just too young to leave to chance the improved childcare inspection regime introduced by the government had seen quality of provision rocket she added a dfes spokesman said the bill will require regulation where it is most needed for young children in addition as schools become extended over the next few years more and more childcare for schoolage children will take place in schools and this provision will either be covered by the school inspection system or should be approved by ofsted,2005-09,government

children left in daycare while their parents work will be put at risk under government plans to scrap official checks on carers childrens organisations are warning the shakeup would affect afterschool clubs nannies creches and childminders for older children which offer a lifeline to millions of parents attempting to juggle work and family childrens charities and daycare professionals have warned education ministers that the move could open the door to cowboy operators taking advantage of overwhelming demand from parents and send the wrong signal to families following a string of concerns over neglectful carers anne longfield chief executive of the childrens charity children which is leading objections to the governments planned childcare bill said unless all daycare providers were forced to register and be inspected routinely there could be no guarantees of the quality of care parents will leave their children there when they go to work and can have no confidence over what will happen without registration she said the quality of staff is absolutely the key thing with young children parents will have no way of judging whether those workers are of any quality or not and will be burdened with the worries that we know they had in the past under the planned bill to be published this autumn nurseries and childminders for children under five would still be forced to register with and be inspected by the schools watchdog ofsted it investigates complaints of cruelty and neglect ensures there are enough staff to give children individual attention and checks they offer stimulating care with chances to play and learn but afterschool clubs and holiday play schemes for the overfives nannies childminders for the overeights and the creches now common in gyms and shopping centres will no longer have to register or undergo proper inspections staff will simply face a basic criminal record check they can volunteer to register but will not have to do so the governments draft proposals argue there is no evidence that it would be necessary for childrens safety to have the same strict checks for overfives as for younger children and that given the government agenda to reduce bureaucracy it should sweep away red tape the bill also contains a new duty on councils to ensure there is enough local childcare making the major expansion offered to working mothers by tony blair at

the government must take a once in a lifetime opportunity to introduce legislation to close the gender pay gap unions said today the call comes as unions await the outcome of a report by the work and women commission on pay inequality which will be outlined at next weeks trades union congress conference they hope the report will back their views that a mandatory approach is now required to force employers to eradicate pay disparities for women workers thirty years after equal pay legislation was introduced women still earn almost a fifth less than their male counterparts this gap widens to for parttime workers an analysis of gender pay disparities across the globe showed the uk ranks eighth in the world according to a study of countries published by the world economic forum the work and women commission set up last summer as a result of the warwick summit between trade unions and the government is due to make its recommendations on solving the pay gap in november but the chairwoman of the commission lady prosser will outline the progress made to date when she makes a keynote speech in front of tuc members unions are hoping to see hardhitting recommendations in the report that force employers to act this includes the introduction of a gender equality duty imposed on employers mandatory pay audits to identify disparities and time off for union equality officers in the workplace but ms prosser signals in todays guardian society that the solutions lay in longerterm changes such as ending the job segregation that sees women tied to traditionally low paid jobs her comments are set to disappoint unions pat campbell head of equalities at the public and commercial service union pcs said experience showed that the voluntary approach to tackling equal pay does not work legislation requiring employers to review their pay systems for gender bias was required she said funding should also be made available in the public sector to address equal pay issues rather than be squandered on the legal costs of defending inequalities in current pay systems through the court derek simpson the general secretary of the manufacturing union amicus said the report should signal a once in a lifetime opportunity to bridge the gender pay gap fair and transparent pay structures are essential to tackling the all too common unfair pay differentials that are often the result of unintentional undervaluing of womens work and skills he said the commission would be well advised to recognise that the case for mandatory pay audits is not an issue that the employers and unions are likely to develop a consensus opinion but they remain the key to achieving equal pay the transport and general workers union also called for equal pay audits to compel employers to take action on pay inequalities that come to light if the government misses this opportunity it will be a tragedy and a failure of their commitment to gender equality said diana holland t amp gs national organiser for women race and equalities we are watching with anticipation employers meanwhile want a voluntary approach to resolving the gender pay gap problem the cbis director of human resources susan anderson said legislation had once played a part in bringing about change but no longer did we shouldnt make the mistake of thinking that more regulation will eliminate the outstanding causes of the pay gap which relate to the choices women make about their careers rather than employer discrimination peter firth spokesman for the federation of small businesses said existing equal pay laws had done little to reduce pay inequality and measures were already in place to redress the problem women who suffer pay inequality could already call on their employer to carry out an equal pay questionnaire he said refusal to do so can affect the award made at a subsequent employment tribunal mr firth said womens attitude was part of the problem there is a problem with the attitude of some women who accept the fallacy that men should earn more as they are traditionally the bread winner he said frustrations at the slow pace of change have prompted unions to take out a number of costly equal pay cases on behalf of members with the government footing the bill in many cases women make up of the public sector workforce and the government is the biggest employer of women in the country earlier this year unison won the biggest ever equal pay award for members working at two nhs hospitals in north west england after an industrial tribunal ruled they suffered pay discrimination the

margaret prosser is feeling hugely nervous the former trade unionist is to address the trades union congress conference next week in her capacity as chair of the work and womens commission aware of the expectation to deliver lifechanging recommendations for women everywhere prosser fears delegates may be disappointed by her final report due this autumn it may not give everything to everybody warns prosser who has been charged with examining how to eradicate the gender pay gap if the recommendations we put forward are acted upon then it will make a huge difference to womens lives out there if people are disappointed because it doesnt give them absolutely what they want i dont want them to ignore the rest of it the gender pay gap is defined as the percentage difference in hourly earnings between average mean womens and mens earnings thirty years after equal pay legislation was introduced fulltime women workers still earn almost a fifth less per hour than their male peers widening to for female parttime workers even recent women graduates after five years in employment earn less than men who have the same qualifications prosser makes no bones about who she blames for letting women workers get a raw deal for so long the unions themselves i dont think they have learnt the lesson yet because i dont think they understand what the issue is she says they think unequal pay is a man and a woman doing the same job and receiving unequal wages her views are shaped in part by her years of championing pay equality as a fulltime official at the transport and general workers union tgwu where she rose through the ranks to become its deputy general secretary when she joined in many senior officials in the the maledominated unions were really hostile to the womens agenda they did not see a campaign for equal pay as an industrial campaign but as something on the periphery the daughter of a builder and a housewife prosser is cool and selfassured she did a bit of this and a bit of that as dinner lady packer cleaner and other lowpaid parttime jobs while raising three children until her husband was suddenly paralysed through illness in eight subsequent years spent on benefits and the frustrations of dealing with the social security system helped politicise her prossers first contact with the tgwu came when she began fulltime work as law centre adviser after her husband went into residential care six years later she became a paid official and began the slow tread to impress equal pay on the union agenda prossers report will be the third of its kind in four years she has been involved in all three in she sat on the equal pay taskforce which criticised the lack of commitment shown by the triumvirate of employers unions and government to close the pay gap a subsequent report just pay published by the equal opportunities commission called for a law to force employers to carry out regular equal pay reviews a transparent pay process to root out inequality and an end to the job segregation that parks women in undervalued underpaid jobs the government responded by setting up its own review into womens pay and employment led by denise kingsmill a former deputy chair of the competition commission with britain having one of the widest gender pay gaps in europe the kingsmill report in called for mandatory pay reviews and the right for employees to request confirmation that their pay was equal to a named colleague prosser is undeterred by the governments ability to ignore those reports recommendations tony blair himself established the latest study she points out the women and work commission is the most deep and thorough investigation of the issues around the continuing pay gap we looked at it from every single angle prosser identifies three factors sustaining the gender pay gap parttime working occupational segregation and womens labour market issues such as childcare which act as barriers to womens chances of entering and progressing in the workplace the gap in education and skills compared with men is still a problem but one that has narrowed she says pay inequality is as rife in the public sector as private industry according to prosser women make up of the public sector workforce compared with in the private sector the only reason pay inequality looks worse in the private sector is because of the lucrative city jobs predominantly held by men that skew statistics she says female civil servants face a pay gap of worse now than months ago the government has pledged to introduce a public sector duty to promote gender equality by december which should encourage public authorities to review pay systems and prevent the trickle of costly equal pay cases from turning into an avalanche there are lots of jobs in local government and health and central government where it has been determined that womens jobs are undervalued and underpaid by job evaluation if not by pay tribunals she says privately equal pay activists within the trade union movement are resigned to many of prossers more erudite expected recommendations being ignored by government prosser is attempting to avoid this by talking to heads of departments to test out their willingness to implement her ideas she denies that this will water down the recommendations there is no point in making a whole bag of recommendations if these people are not going to buy into it or the treasury say its not on the cards she explains so before the report i will have determined whether or not the powers that be will be prepared to support the recommendations and initiatives prosser rules out the mandatory equal pay reviews called for by the unions the answer she believes lies not in identifying a problem everyone knows exists but in implementing big policy changes to create solutions for example the job segregation that sees women wedded to traditionally lowpaid jobs such as care work and their lack of access to decent quality parttime employment lots and lots of women are in jobs below their capabilities and there is no route out of there we need a route prosser remains vaguely hopeful that the important jobs women do for low pay will one day be valued more highly by society womens jobs are valued pretty lowly and that is a major part of the problem she says direct discrimination from what we can see is not a major cause she is considering introducing equality reps in the workplace but with an important caveat we are looking seriously at that and think it could perform a useful task but they must not be seen as an opportunity for the general shop stewards to chuck over their shoulder all these issues that are to do with women workers she intends to see the government deliver but before the chapter is closed we need to determine who is going to be the watchdog of our recommendations would she be interested in such a role i would be willing to rather than seeing it not done she says the cv age status

many of us remember our first day of school with horror and excitement but for the parent left behind in the school playground the experience is as stressful as going through a divorce as thousands of parents prepare to take their children to school for the first time this week a new survey has found that parents particularly mothers dread the day their child starts school with almost two thirds losing sleep and finding themselves tearful as the day approaches i remember how horrible my first day at school was and im frantically worried that my little girl is about to go through that said vicky pennington a personal trainer whose only child danielle scarciglia will be starting at eastcourt independent school in essex this week i know i am probably getting this out of all proportion but i have been lying awake at night fretting for weeks she said im at the stage where im even worried she might not be able to open her lunchbox or might lose something and i wont be there to help her the survey of more than parents with schoolage children was commissioned by the national confederation of parent teacher associations and nappy manufacturer huggies it found that although per cent of children starting school for the first time are thought to be excited by the prospect the event can also lead to stressrelated problems with over onequarter of parents identifying the event as the trigger for their childs bed wetting girls are believed by their parents to be bolder on the first day of school than boys with one quarter of boys showing signs of nerves compared to per cent of girls although parents look forward to regaining their independence with mothers of sons expressing more enthusiasm for their newfound release than those with daughters they also report the experience is as stressful as breaking up with their partner chris davis who chairs the national primary headteachers association and is head of queniborough primary school near leicester has had to prise mothers away from their children on the first day of term its the mothers clinging to their children rarely vice versa he said the children are generally excited and positive about the adventure davis says he is seeing less raw emotion in the playground now than in the past there are so many preschool schemes for children mothers are often already used to being separated from their children by the time primary school begins but i often find the upset is more intense when the child is the last in their sibling group because the mother realises an era has come to an end kate owen agrees that she became more upset each time she took one of her four children to school for the first time last week she took tom her fourth and youngest child to st peters primary school in heswall merseyside and is still shaken by the experience this weekend the thought of him finally going to school has caused me to have little cries to myself for a few weeks now she said i know that although hes so very special to me he is just one of other children to his teacher its terrible knowing that if he is worried i wont be there to comfort him she said but in my heart i also know i am reacting in this way because although i am very worried about how he will get on hes also my last child and now my life has to move into a completely different stage margaret morrissey spokesperson for the national confederation of parent teacher associations said that although starting school is stressful for parents it is also a massive milestone for their children its important that parents invest a lot of time and support with their children during this period she said while its wonderful to see your child taking the next step to independence its important to keep communicating with them and to talk them through any concerns,2005-09,many u remember first day school horror excitement parent left behind school playground experience stressful going divorce thousand parent prepare take child school

a new childcare service that matches parents with childminders using speed dating techniques has proved to be a success it emerged today fifteen events have been held so far this year in schools or community centres where childminders sit at a table and parents can interview them in turn for five to minutes at the end of the evening parents leave their contact details with the event organiser who passes them on to the childminder they want if that childminder wants to look after their children they then contact the parents directly the service was developed months ago by the national childminding association ncma and enfield council and was rolled out across the country during national childminding week in june further events have been held in liverpool manchester bromley richmond and bournemouth an ncma spokeswoman said the service run by councils and local childminding groups was particularly popular among new mothers and working parents with little time to arrange childcare she said traditionally parents have to go to their local councils child information service for a list of approved local childminders then they have to phone the childminders and ask if theyve got a vacancy it can be very time consuming and stressful especially for mothers whose maternity leave is running out this service which we call speed minding acts as an ice breaker its more personal than just speaking over the phone the childminders are sat in front of the parents with details on the table about their vacancies so the parents can see who has a vacancy that matches their requirements for example someone may have a place for a sixmonthold child another for a toddler its a gimmick but a successful gimmick,2005-10,new childcare service match parent childminders using speed dating technique ha proved success emerged today fifteen event held far year school community centre childminders sit table parent interview turn five minute end evening parent leave contact detail event organiser pass childminder want childminder want look child contact parent directly service wa developed month ago national childminding association ncma enfield council wa rolled across country national childminding week june event held liverpool manchester bromley richmond bournemouth ncma spokeswoman said service run council local childminding group wa particularly popular among new mother working parent little time arrange childcare said traditionally parent go local council child information service list approved local childminders phone childminders ask theyve got vacancy time consuming stressful especially mother whose maternity leave running service call speed minding act ice breaker personal speaking phone childminders sat front parent detail table vacancy parent see ha vacancy match requirement example someone may place sixmonthold child another toddler gimmick successful gimmick,"['new', 'childcare', 'service', 'match', 'parent', 'childminders', 'using', 'speed', 'dating', 'technique', 'ha', 'proved', 'success', 'emerged', 'today', 'fifteen', 'event', 'held', 'far', 'year', 'school', 'community', 'centre', 'childminders', 'sit', 'table', 'parent', 'interview', 'turn', 'five', 'minute', 'end', 'evening', 'parent', 'leave', 'contact', 'detail', 'event', 'organiser', 'pass', 'childminder', 'want', 'childminder', 'want', 'look', 'child', 'contact', 'parent', 'directly', 'service', 'wa', 'developed', 'month', 'ago', 'national', 'childminding', 'association', 'ncma', 'enfield', 'council', 'wa', 'rolled', 'across', 'country', 'national', 'childminding', 'week', 'june', 'event', 'held', 'liverpool', 'manchester', 'bromley', 'richmond', 'bournemouth', 'ncma', 'spokeswoman', 'said', 'service', 'run', 'council', 'local', 'childminding', 'group', 'wa', 'particularly', 'popular', 'among', 'new', 'mother', 'working', 'parent', 'little', 'time', 'arrange', 'childcare', 'said', 'traditionally', 'parent', 'go', 'local', 'council', 'child', 'information', 'service', 'list', 'approved', 'local', 'childminders', 'phone', 'childminders', 'ask', 'theyve', 'got', 'vacancy', 'time', 'consuming', 'stressful', 'especially', 'mother', 'whose', 'maternity', 'leave', 'running', 'service', 'call', 'speed', 'minding', 'act', 'ice', 'breaker', 'personal', 'speaking', 'phone', 'childminders', 'sat', 'front', 'parent', 'detail', 'table', 'vacancy', 'parent', 'see', 'ha', 'vacancy', 'match', 'requirement', 'example', 'someone', 'may', 'place', 'sixmonthold', 'child', 'another', 'toddler', 'gimmick', 'successful', 'gimmick']",95
new fathers will be able to take up to six months paternity leave at least some of it paid under government plans granting uk working parents some of the most generous rights in europe the work and families bill published yesterday will also fulfil a labour manifesto promise by extending paid maternity leave from six to nine months from april with the goal of a further three months payment the right to ask to work flexibly will be extended from parents of young children to carers of adults the move was hailed by the trade and industry secretary alan johnson as allowing working parents to balance the demands of a job with caring for children with only minimal impact on employers business organisations however raised concerns over the extra administrative burden involved parenting and childcare campaigners broadly welcomed the plans but warned that leave would have to be paid more generously if it was to offer a genuine choice to parents particularly fathers the additional paternity leave which comes on top of the current right to two weeks leave for fathers of a new baby will be available to men whose partners go back to work after at least six months of maternity leave but before their full month entitlement ends providing the mother is eligible to receive maternity pay the father would be paid at the rate of a week the same as statutory maternity pay for the period his partner would have been entitled to the money though employers would be free to top that sum up if they wished as many do for mothers according to government estimates only between and of the new fathers in the uk each year will take up the additional paternity leave duncan fisher the chief executive of the fatherhood campaigners fathers direct said giving parents real choice as to who looks after a baby will not be a practical option for most families until the new paternity leave is properly paid mr johnson said that unlike his own generation when new fathers would be down the pub buying everyone a drink there was a growing interest in fathers taking a greater role in childcare in a babys first year industry broadly supported the measures he said though the cbi said it remained in the dark on whether businesses would be able to hand the administrative burden of maternity pay back to the government the extension of the right to request flexible working to carers of adults was welcomed by campaigners the government is to consult on exactly how carers will be defined but estimates that up to million employed carers may be entitled to make a request once the new right comes

hundreds of thousands of new fathers were given a boost today when the government confirmed plans to give them up to three months paid paternity leave maternity pay was also increased to nine months under moves which the government said would increase equality and flexibility in britains workplaces the proposals were outlined in the work and families bill published today by the trade and industry secretary alan johnson he said the bill was designed to create a modern framework of employment rights and maintained that it would have a minimal impact on business despite concerns especially from smaller firms that they will suffer because of the new rights under the bill fathers will be able to take up to six months unpaid leave but will receive paternity pay for three months if a mother returns to work after six months and before her maternity leave ends this would be at the rate of a week which would be reimbursed to companies by the treasury the department of trade and industry said up to fathers could benefit from the plan which will now go out to consultation todays bill delivers on our commitment to help working parents balance the demands of their job with caring for their children by introducing a modern framework of rights and responsibilities that offers real choice and flexibility said mr johnson to help mothers we will extend paid maternity leave to nine months with the aim of increasing it to a year increasingly fathers want to play a more active role in bringing up their children so we will help them take time off when the mother returns to work by introducing a new right to paternity leave mr johnson maintained there was broad support from both sides of industry for the family friendly measures and he said he was also introducing a number of proposals to make it easier for businesses to deal with workers taking time off under the bill statutory maternity pay will be increased to nine months from april with the ambition of moving it to a year by the end of the current parliament the right to request flexible working currently limited to parents of young children will be extended to carers from april the government also announced that it wanted to introduce so called keeping in touch days so that women on maternity leave can go into work for a few days without losing their statutory pay the period of notice for returning to work from maternity leave will be extended to two months unions and campaigners for fathers rights warmly welcomed todays announcement offering extended paternity leave with the option of some payment is an important first step towards reforming our antiquated leave system and giving parents real choice as to who looks after a baby said duncan fisher chief executive of campaign group fathers direct but it will not be a practical option for most families until the new paternity leave is properly paid the government should build on this first step to move more quickly to support properly the huge social change that sees fathers now doing onethird of the practical childcare of the underfives employers were taken by surprise by the announcement and said the government had underestimated the impact of the new rules on smaller firms employers have worked extremely hard to adjust to the large volume of familyfriendly and flexible working practices introduced by the government over a very short timeframe said john cridland deputy directorgeneral of the confederation of british industry the business community recognises the aspirations of their employees but the unexpected new right for fathers which wasnt even in the labour manifesto has caused concern particularly among smaller firms this is not just about money although there will be undeniable pressure to pay occupational paternity pay equally importantly this is about planning and the very ability of smaller companies to stay in business,2005-10,hundred thousand new father given boost today government confirmed plan

childrens day nurseries in britain are on average only three quarters full the lowest level for five years as parents face aboveinflation fee increases according to a survey published today in some areas including the home counties one of the most expensive areas for nursery provision almost a third of places are unfilled on average figures show most vacant places are for three and fouryearolds indicating that parents are increasingly opting to take up free nursery places for those age groups in schools now available to all who want them the evidence of declining occupancy levels prompted nursery leaders to warn the fall had major implications for the sustainability of the day nursery sector closures would limit choice for parents the national day nurseries association ndna said warning that increasing staff costs must be covered by the government and not parents the survey conducted for nursery amp childcare market news also found fees charged by nurseries increased by an average of above the rate of inflation over the last months and are anticipated to rise by a similar rate in the next year childcare costs in the uk are already the highest in europe with fees in london and the southeast of england particularly steep the typical weekly cost to parents of a full time nursery place is and more for babies planned fee rises of in the coming months would mean an average place will cost by next year in an ironic twist given the uks historically inadequate childcare provision the fall in day nursery rolls could be the result of an increase in governmentfunded nursery places which combined with private sector numbers have led to an oversupply though many parents will still find themselves priced out of a private nursery option nurseries are likely to have to increase fees to meet growing staff costs as they try to recruit and retain workers nursery staff are notoriously poorly paid but the government wants pay to increase in exchange for a better qualified workforce purnima tanuku the ndna chief executive expressed serious concerns about falling rolls she urged local authorites who under a forthcoming childcare bill will be obliged to provide sufficient childcare for their local areas to work closely with existing private and voluntary day nurseries to avoid duplication of services parents could not afford to meet the increased cost of

the vast majority of fathers will find it financially impossible to take six months paternity leave unless the time off is paid campaigners said yesterday the equal opportunities commission and the maternity alliance cautioned ministers preparing to publish the work and families bill that extended paternity leave would not be viable or a real right unless extra cash was made available their warnings came as research by the commission published yesterday highlighted a social revolution in attitudes to fatherhood with more than threequarters of new mothers surveyed saying their partner was as confident as they were at caring for a new baby more than three in five rejected the idea of a fathers main role being as the breadwinner saying they should also share in parenting and more than twothirds thought their partner would be happy to stay at home to look after the baby indications that ministers want to introduce six months paternity leave up from two weeks paid at a week at present have caught parenting campaigners and business leaders unawares since the option was not canvassed during a threemonth consultation this summer at the general election labour made much of plans to extend paid maternity leave to nine months by and months by the end of this parliament it also proposed allowing mothers to hand over some of the leave and pay to fathers in its consultation the government asked for views on this transferable maternity leave which would let fathers take over maternity rights once the baby was six months where couples wished to do so but it emerged that the proposal would fall foul of european laws forbidding governments from taking mothers existing rights away it appears that the department of trade and industry has opted to get round the legal obstacle by offering fathers their own right to six months leave providing a mother forgoes the equivalent period but indications are that the leave will not be paid though it is understood the bill will leave scope for introducing payment the move is backed by fatherhood and equality campaigners who say it finally gives fathers their own protected right to extended leave it would also mean fathers had a right to leave even if the mother had not qualified for maternity rights jenny watson the commissions acting chair said we hope the government hasnt closed the door to payment of leave for fathers and that it seizes this opportunity to halt the spread of the most unequal parenting arrangements in europe the cbis deputy director general john cridland said if the governments policy extending paternity leave is what we are led to believe it constitutes a major new employment right that was not in labours manifesto it puts pressure on employers to provide occupational paternity pay for fathers opens the door to further extensions of the law and has formed no part of the governments previous discussions with employers,2005-10,vast majority father find financially impossible

the government is to announce that fathers should have the right to six months unpaid paternity leave independent of the decision of the female partner to take leave ministers regard the move as central to making fathers feel more responsible for the upbringing of their children they believe it also reflects the importance of parents being present in the crucial first stages of their childs life previously the government had been proposing that the mother and father should be entitled to share the leave but the plan common in scandinavia is now deemed unworkable in britain critics will claim the new rights will rarely be taken up since no additional state or company financial support will be provided at present fathers are entitled to two weeks paid paternity leave set at a minimum government support of a week a father taking the full six months off would be entitled to take their company to an industrial tribunal if the firm refused to give them back their original job previously trailed maternity rights will also be confirmed this week allowing mothers to enjoy nine months paid maternity leave from april and a year from some of the proposals were immediately attacked by the cbi and other employers groups as deeply worrying separate rights for carers are also being planned business will be seeking exemptions for small firms and requiring lengthy continuous employment record before the rights kick in the cbis deputy director general john cridland said this will put a lot of pressure on business and we have huge concerns the new right for fathers is very different from shared maternity leave which was a better option for business but the plan is intended to go beyond bringing a better work life balance to families and seems to be part of a fundamental rethink in labour about morality crime and the role of the family the childrens minister beverley hughes will next week attend the launch of a book from the institute of public policy research

zoe williamss frustration a stick to beat women october at yet another study seeming to criticise the use of nursery provision by working mothers is understandable it is newspaper headlines rather than real research intentions that impact on hardpressed parents making choices about childcare yet penelope leach has said repeatedly that the families children and childcare study is not about blaming mothers but improving our understanding of the effects of different forms of childcare her study is vital to our evolving understanding of not just the childcare choices of individual families but the collective decisions we are making as a society we also need intensive case studies of individual childcare settings to give us good evidence about what exactly it is we are asking nurseries to do here our own research is beginning to reveal the complexity of what we ask of nursery staff on the one hand they are expected to form close relationships with children on the other they have to be professional detached fair in their work with many different children and never to put themselves in a position of closeness that might lead to a child protection concern such a sophisticated balancing act needs very special systems of management and support as childcare policy evolves we desperately need the best and widest evidence we can get an approach that argues we have no individual or collective choice so evidence is pointless is no way to proceed peter elfer roehampton university zoe williams has missed several crucial points the study to which she refers doesnt say mothers provide the best for the underthrees it says group nursery care often doesnt whats best for the very young is onetoone care by an adult who is reasonably responsive its not mothers who are the gold standard of care but an involved and receptive adult but the study also concedes that sometimes fulltime nursery care is the best choice available five years ago the department for education and skills commissioned research which revealed that on average a child in a nursery received only eight minutes of undiluted adult care a day the study was never published all research is subjective but common sense tells most parents that good onetoone care or close to it for the very young has to have attractions yvonne roberts london we recognise that parents have difficult choices many want to stay at home but its just not possible or desirable for all the debate surrounding penelope leachs research demonstrates that we are right to invest in good quality early years services we are not telling parents what to do but we are trying to provide them with real choices where previously there were none our approach is threefold more opportunity for working parents to stay at home or work flexibly measures such as tax credits to improve living standards and making excellent integrated childcare available to all who want it we believe good quality childcare can benefit the intellectual and social development of children particularly from age two upwards and for children from disadvantaged backgrounds the evidence is clear that we must continue to focus on the early years to give every child the opportunity to succeed beverley hughes mp minister for children young people and families as a participant in the longterm study chaired by penelope leach i find it nothing short of incredible that the role of fathers hasnt merited a single mention in all the column inches dedicated to the study this leads to the depressing conclusion that fathers are assumed to have no place in their childrens early lives and development and yet where i live in north london the dads are everywhere so whats going on in this equation the men who are parenting their children get none of the

government moves to provide free nursery education for children aged two could be bad for youngsters social and emotional development according to the author of a study that concludes babies and young toddlers are best off cared for at home by their mothers the childcare expert penelope leach publishing part of a major study which suggests nurseries are the worse childcare option for children up to at least months said extending early education to younger children would end up with more youngsters in nursery at an inappropriate age she also said childrens centres undergoing a rapid expansion to include one in every community should not end up as little more than nurseries with addon but should offer dropin centres where infants would come with a parent or other carer and not be pressured towards group play too early the findings of the families children and childcare study by dr leach and colleagues kathy sylva and alan stein which tracked children and their families in north london and oxfordshire from three months to just over four years have reignited the fraught debate over how best to care for young children the conclusions outlined at a national childminding association conference yesterday have been seized on much to the authors frustration by those who want to reverse mothers moves back to the workplace as well as drawing criticism from those who believe they are just another stick with which to beat working mothers but the findings also challenge government policy which has focused on a dramatic expansion in childcare mainly in nursery provision a childcare bill due next month will compel local authorities to provide care for youngsters aged up to years if their parents want it critics say ministers want parents particularly those on low incomes to go back to the workplace too soon without considering what is best for children ministers defended the year childcare strategy yesterday saying the government was not telling parents what to do but hoped to provide those who wanted to work and those who wanted to stay at home with real choices a department for education spokesman said good quality childcare could actually benefit the intellectual and social development of children particularly from age two upwards ministers pointed to the effective provision of preschool education project published last november which found that preschool children with three years of quality preschool provision who started in nursery at two or younger were up to a year ahead of their contemporaries in educational attainment at the start of primary school that has prompted the government to consider extending free early years education to twoyearolds the move will be piloted among children by but dr leach said that babies and toddlers were not the same as preschool children and that even highquality groupbased care was not suitable until children were around three it was likely that free care for twoyearolds would end up being in nurseries which were not best for the younger age group she said she said the government should not go further to support mothers to stay at home but should seek to widen genuine choice partly by expanding childminding the advantages of young children being at home with their mother or a nanny were partly derived from offering infants more attention than a nursery could provide she said she speculated that the studys results for older children yet to be published would show a complete turnaround at age three or a little younger when children undoubtedly benefited from some groupbased care and education home or away my oneyearold is at nursery whilei work am i risking damaging her development the families children and childcare fccc study concludes that for babies and toddlers up to months infants looked after at home by their mothers show better social and emotional development than children who have been in childcare though other homebased care including nannies and childminders is in turn better than nursery but the differences are small the authors emphasise that toddlers do better at good nurseries than at poor or mediocre ones and those whose mothers are depressed or less sensitive to their needs benefit from highquality childcare my mum has offered to help care for my toddler would that be better the study says care by grandparents and other informal carers produces better outcomes than nurseries though quality is significantly higher among childminders and higher still among nannies should i be taking up the governments offer of a free nursery place for three and fouryearolds the fccc research does cover older preschoolers but those findings have not yet been published they are expected to show that from around three children benefit from spending some time in high quality nursery education why doesnt the study mention fathers the fccc study looked at the role of fathers but the findings have not yet been published,2005-10,government move provide free

vive la difference british coverage of riots in france has bordered on smug believing their maghrebin names exclude them from jobs young protesters are torching cars because it is reported french society is not as racially harmonious as ours work is a good maybe the best integration strategy and french employers we say must put an end to discrimination as we have the government can be proud of the employment equality regulations enacted in the past two years yet years since the race relations act good jobs in our comparatively integrated workplaces remain out of reach for minorities in particular for the uks m ethnic minority women how many black professionals do you know challenges sarah not her real name sarah has a firstclass degree years professional experience in the government media and voluntary sectors and an active role in local politics but she no longer has the appetite to break through what she calls the concrete ceiling i have an african surname so it takes me longer to get a job in the first place when i do im often the first black person who has been employed there i worked in an ad agency in soho of people and i was the only black employee four hundred people ive been in meetings where coworkers have been visibly disturbed because i had something intelligent to say ive watched white colleagues with fewer qualifications get paid more ive been promoted to senior positions but never quite made it into management many of my friends have experienced the same intelligent articulate women bullied or pushed into accepting jobs for which theyre overqualified were fine as carers or cleaners were not supposed to be executives now sarah has quit her job to start a communications business im an ambitious person but as a yearold black woman ive realised that at those kinds of companies theres no more ladder to climb fewer than of ftse company directors are female but for minority women its a double maybe triple whammy new equal opportunities commission eoc figures reveal a gaping chasm between young pakistani bangladeshi and africancaribbean womens ambitions and the realities they face in the workplace research among women found those from ethnic minority backgrounds are just as ambitious as white women and often more skilled with the government committed to closing the ethnic minority employment gap by the eoc is to investigate why young minority women are three to four times more likely than white women to take a job at a lower level than they are qualified for race amplifies sex discrimination says eoc chief executive caroline slocock sometimes its because their faces dont fit they cant or wont tailor their appearance and behaviour to approximate successful white men but minority women are also more likely to face sex discrimination than white women they are says slocock three times more likely to be asked at interviews about plans for marriage and children faith can add another layer of complexity one in five pakistani and bangladeshi women say they have experienced negative attitudes when wearing the hijab at work only the most stupid of employers are ignorant of employment law some know about the benefits of a diverse workforce but few are clever enough to spot the huge reservoir of leadership talent right under their noses in the us where ethnic minorities comprise of managerial workers a study of minority women reveals that many who are denied management opportunities at work are actually in leadership roles outside the office sylvia ann hewlett of the hidden bias taskforce a team of researchers sponsored by companies including bt bp unilever and eversheds found that women from minority backgrounds are called upon inordinately to lend their energies to activities outside their jobs they have volunteer roles in their communities schools churches hospices shelters and scout troops yet these skills are not recognised by their employers beyond perhaps appointing them to an inhouse diversity committee much of what theyre doing outside work is profoundly important and the skills are transferable to the workplace but its below the radar says hewlett as a result many she says feel ignored overextended and burnedout one in five minority women in professional jobs experience hidden biases severe enough to make them think about quitting if people cant share any of the stuff going on in their real lives at work they become alienated they quit but stay on the job its a terrible result for everyone including the employer says hewlett women are often reluctant to speak of their outside achievements they dont want it to reinforce a negative stereotype says hewlett sometimes this is because it would touch on a taboo subject such as religion a few employers are paying attention ikea and the police have modified uniforms to accommodate the hijab some firms support the community groups their employees are involved in or at least allow them time for volunteer activities hewlett found more than half of minority professional women are working mothers compared with of white women many are single mothers or the main breadwinners and minority women spend significant amounts of time caring for relatives too many employers still focus benefits packages on the white nuclear family forgetting that perhaps the most urgent responsibilities in the lives of say asian employees might be parents or grandparents and a final thought for the smug or complacent hewletts next challenge is to examine extreme jobs and how top posts are so demanding in their time commitment and responsibilities that they are increasingly beyond the reach of minorities employers have to reengineer these jobs at the top she warns otherwise were in danger of reinventing white

there was a narrowing in the gender pay gap last year thanks to the number of women breaking through the glass ceiling into higher paid jobs and the chastening effect on employers of highprofile discrimination cases although the average man in a fulltime job still earns about a week more than the average woman evidence from the office for national statistics showed that the gradual trend towards greater equality continued in more generous pay awards for the public sector where women are better represented in top jobs helped to push up fulltime median earnings for women by to a week with fulltime median male earnings up by to a week the pay gap narrowed from to in the gap was the fawcett society which campaigns for pay equality between the sexes said the improvement for women was not coming quickly enough and at the current rate of progress it would take years to close the earnings gap kate bellamy the societys senior policy officer for economic inequalities said every thinking person would agree that its not right for women to be paid less than men but thats what still happens even after years of equal pay legislation we are calling on the government today to take bold new measures to end the unfair pay gap that causes so many women to be financially dependent on a partner or the state the fawcett society is seeking compulsory audits to reveal pay inequalities stronger wellenforced laws to ensure fair treatment of parttime employees full signup to the working time directive and other steps to tackle britains long hours culture which limits career advancement for women and mens involvement at home and more flexible working peter talibart global head of employment at the international law firm norton rose said the narrowing of the pay gap was the result of several highprofile discrimination cases women who are paid less for doing the same job as a man know that they can bring a strong case against their employer and an employer who does so takes an irresponsible risk the tucs general secretary brendan barber said we welcome the fact that the fulltime gender pay gap has narrowed slightly but this is no cause for complacency parttime women are still as badly paid as ever the ons annual survey of hours and earnings ashe showed that the pay gap between rich and poor grew wider in and that there was also an increase in the number of people earning less than the minimum wage when officials divided the workforce up into tenths it found that those in the bottom tenth saw their earnings go up by between and while those in the top tenth enjoyed increases of mr barber said to lift the quality of life for the lowest paid the minimum wage must continue to increase and inwork benefits should rise in line with earnings rather than inflation david willetts the shadow trade and industry secretary said the fact that public sector workers earned more than private sector workers highlighted the unfairness of giving preferential pension treatment to those working for the state the ons said median earnings for fulltime workers in the public sector rose to a week last year compared with to in the private sector the government says the public sector gets better pensions in compensation for lower pay mr willetts said todays evidence shows how they now get better pensions and better pay this shows how wrong the government was to give up on serious reform of public service pensions john philpott chief economist at the chartered institute for personnel and development said the ashe figures indicate that the chancellor can

the government has been urged to take action after an official report revealed that although the gender pay gap has narrowed it remains in double figures the figures published years after the introduction of the sex discrimination act show that in the year to april women working fulltime earned on average less than their male colleagues the gap has narrowed to its lowest level ever but is only smaller than last year when men took home more than women the fawcett society said that if the gap continued to narrow at this rate it would take years for women to achieve equal pay every thinking person would agree that its not right for women to be paid less than men but thats what still happens even after years of equal pay legislation said kate bellamy the societys senior policy officer she added we are calling on the government today to take bold new measures to end the unfair pay gap that causes so many women to be financially dependent on a partner or the state the equal opportunities commission eoc said the figures were grim adding that years after the introduction of the equal pay act it was clear the law had reached the limits of its usefulness unless radical new action is taken another generation of women can expect to suffer the injustice of unequal pay said the eocs acting chairwoman jenny watson current legislation places the burden on individuals to fight for equal pay through the tribunal courts which is costly for both employees and employers and its not working we know that twothirds of employers have no plans to check their pay systems to see if they deliver equal pay it is time for government to ask employers to take more proactive steps to address this persistent problem through the introduction of a requirement on the private sector to promote sex equality and eliminate sex discrimination the gmb union said urgent action was needed to close the unacceptable pay gap between men and women its general secretary paul kenny said there is a culture in british industry where job segregation is seen as normal but this has to be brought to an end the minister for women tessa jowell welcomed the office of national statistics findings which she said were proof that government policies to close the gap were working this shows that government policies to address the reasons why the pay gap has existed for so long are working the minimum wage flexible working and better maternity and paternity leave she said but there is no room for complacency we must close the pay and skills gap further to ensure women have higher lifetime earnings and higher pensions our next step will be to take forward the recommendations from the women and work commissions report which we look forward to receiving in january,2005-11,government ha urged take

skills and the london development agency lda aims to keep fees for fulltime daycare places down to the aweek tax credit ceiling and to prompt nurseries and accredited childminding networks to offer more flexible hours childcare costs up to more in london than the rest of england and the money will provide vital support the lda claimed mr livingstone claimed the project would make a real difference to thousands of london households and make highquality childcare available to lowincome families but the new money does not tackle the shortage of places according to london assembly liberal democrat dee doocey in many parts of london demand for places still outstrips supply she said the trouble is that the childcare affordability programme doesnt create new places but only makes existing childcare more affordable she called on mr livingstone to deliver an extra new childcare places this year in addition to the childcare affordability programme warning that otherwise the capital will still be short of what londons parents need standards governing childcare provision in england and wales are to be overhauled as part of government efforts to streamline childcare and

ministers abandoned their attempt to end the compulsory regulation of childminders afterschool clubs and playschemes caring for children over five yesterday beverley hughes the childrens minister performed the uturn after a revolt by parents and childminders who feared deregulation could open the market to rogue operators and put children at risk in a preview of the childcare bill expected to reach parliament before the end of the year she said all providers of outofschool care for children under eight years would be obliged to register with the schools inspectorate ofsted and be subject to routine safety checks she told the conference of the national childcare charity daycare trust in london ensuring children particularly young children are safe is a key concern registration will be compulsory for childcare providers for children up to age eight whilst remaining voluntary for those providing care for children up to the government produced its original deregulation plan in a consultation paper in july it said providers of brief periods of daycare for children over five years should not be subject to the burden of compulsory regulation this appeared to run counter to a drive to improve the quality of childminders who became subject to ofsted inspection five years ago naomi eisenstadt the head of the governments surestart programme said in september that children aged five to seven did not need the same level of protection as a baby or twoyearold they could tell their parents whether they liked the childminder or afterschool club and parents could react but the results of the consultation posted yesterday on the surestart website showed that parents and childminders did not agree about of those responding to the proposals said they did not do enough to deliver quality childcare and maintain minimum standards many felt providers for all children should be required to register some thought the proposals would allow anyone to set up unregistered provision and evade inspection the government said ms hughes has compromised by extending compulsory regulation to those providing care for children up to eight not she gave no details on how the government would interpret its plans to make local authorities responsible for securing sufficient childcare in each area to meet the needs of working parents and those seeking work the daycare trust welcomed the uturn lisa harker its chairwoman said this will reassure parents that childcare is safe and meets certain standards services for children need to be the highest quality the government can help to ensure this by making sure inspection and regulation is effective and transparent and by pressing ahead with muchneeded investment in the childcare workforce liz bayram the policy director of the national childminding association of england and wales said its members welcomed ofsted scrutiny strong regulation and inspection play a major role in measuring the quality of childcare she said we are delighted the government has reconsidered its plans nurseries had a professional place of business that could be assessed by parents childminders working on their own were less visible in the local community they valued an independent assessment by ofsted that could reassure parents they were doing a good job ms bayram said although ministers expected children aged five to eight to join afterschool activities in extended schools they would find many continued to be placed with childminders she added,2005-11,minister abandoned attempt end compulsory regulation childminders afterschool

standards in private nurseries have become so bad that the government is planning to use a m fund to help recruit properly trained staff it was reported today private sector nurseries will be given grants of up to for every graduate they recruit following research which says children do better in nurseries where staff are graduates according to the times newspaper ofsted has issued several damning reports on the state of private childcare facilities criticising the quality and availability of staff lack of planning poor security and substandard facilities only one in childcare workers has a degree and pay in the sector is currently so low that nurseries complain they cannot compete to attract the top staff now private and voluntary nurseries who employ graduates will reportedly be able to have part of their salary reimbursed from next april the money will come from the department for education and skills m transformation fund fully qualified teachers are paid an average to more than other nursery staff a dfes source told the paper we are very keen to keep the mixed supply of nursery care with providers from the independent private and voluntary sectors but we want more graduates to be in leadership roles a direct subsidy for their salary is the most effective way to encourage the recruitment of more graduates such subsidies are highly unusual and would be seen by some on the labour left as an illustration of the danger of using the private sector to expand provision an official departmental spokeswoman insisted there had been no decision on how the transformation fund would be spent what we have always said is private and voluntary sectors should be able to offer the same quality as the public sector she added the daycare trust a national

the chair of the gender pay commission today rounded on the tory leader david cameron over his pledge to tackle the injustice of pay inequality for women mr cameron used the th anniversary of the equal pay act yesterday to condemn the fact that womens pay is still nearly a fifth lower than mens a gap that widens to for parttime women workers but lady prosser chair of the women and work commission today attacked the conservative partys track record if it were not for years of tory rule our job would have been rather easier she said there has been an awful lot of trying to catch up on because of years of driving down womens wages it is a pity when mr cameron was advising the chancellor normal lamont that he did not understand it then lady prosser a former trade union deputy leader and a longtime champion of equal pay has spent the last months chairing the commission set up in july by prime minister tony blair to narrow the gender pay gap alongside board members from business and trade unions lady prosser has been exploring the causes of enduring pay inequality prior to her final report due out at the end of next month the commission has identified three key factors sustaining the gender pay gap parttime working occupational segregation and womens labour market issues such as childcare which act as barriers to womens chances of entering and progressing in the workplace a list of recommendations on the best way forward will be published in her final report due out next month mr blairs government is likely to face direct recommendations to get its own house in order as one of the countrys biggest employers female civil servants face a pay gap of worse now than months ago the conservatives say the problem should be resolved by making pay more transparent with employers leading a change in cultural attitudes to pay according to mr cameron it is totally unacceptable in a modern civilised society for there to be a pay gap between men and women doing equivalent work mr cameron said it is morally wrong quite apart from the practical problems it creates there has been far too much complacency over this issue the battle for equal pay still has to be won this persistent injustice makes child poverty worse prevents women in our society from reaching their full potential and contributes to poverty in old age for many women who have worked hard all

thirty years after the laws to end sexual discrimination in the workplace were passed equality is still a thin veneer for many women according to the equal opportunities commission in a report released today the eoc condemns the progress made in the past three decades to narrow the pay gap between women and men and says there is still discrimination at work particularly when women have children or take on other family activities jenny watson who chairs the eoc called for a new generation of laws to help narrow the gap between males and females in the workplace for many women sex equality is a thin veneer which vanishes as soon as they take on caring responsibilities ms watson said we need to make more of womens talents and skills and prevent them from being channelled into low paid parttime work below their potential the report published today on the th anniversary of the introduction of the sex discrimination act found there was still an average pay gap between the sexes in fulltime work and a gap in parttime posts ms watson said this was a pay penalty that had hardly changed in the past three decades while the sex discrimination and equal pay acts have done much to tackle discrimination the scandalous inequalities that women still endure today show that they have reached the limits of their usefulness she said a new generation of laws are needed so that the responsibility for gender equality is shared between individuals employers and government britains economy which is already experiencing chronic skills shortages simply cannot afford to miss out on this pool of wasted talent the report was published as the gmb trade union highlighted an alleged case of sexual discrimination involving the supermarket chain morrisons the gmb claimed that women employees at the supermarket would receive only onethird of the redundancy pay of male colleagues when they lose their jobs in the new year the staff at a finance centre in crossgate south shields on tyneside most of whom are female will receive statutory redundancy pay plus an enhancement of for each year of service the gmb said male colleagues at morrisons depots in aylesford kent and warrington in cheshire will receive three times the statutory amount plus a lump sum martin gannon of the gmb said sex discrimination is alive and well one employer practising it is trading on a high street near you morrisons which took over safeway are trying to make female staff in south shields redundant on only a third of the redundancy money that they have agreed to pay the mainly male staff being made redundant in the warehouses he confirmed staff at the finance centre acquired by morrisons as part of its bn takeover of the safeway chain were not gmb members at the time the union negotiated the warehouse workers redundancy deal but the law of the land says that you cannot discriminate against people whether they are union members or not or whether they are male or female he said in october morrisons posted the first loss in its year history after it was hampered by the cost of integrating safeway and announced redundancies as part of a reorganisation a morrisons spokesman said allegations of sex discrimination are irresponsible and unfounded any decisions that the company may make in respect of the finance centre at crossgate will affect both male and female employees alike accordingly the implied accusation that the companys treatment of employees at crossgate is directed at female employees is both ill informed and misconceived although the eoc report showed the average difference between the sexes ranged from in fulltime public sector jobs to in parttime private sector jobs the statistics showed sex equality has taken great strides since when women represented just onethird of higher education students in girls outperformed boys at school and made up of students and the number of women in the workforce has increased by a third since women are also reaching higher levels in the workplace of managers were women in compared with fewer than in,2005-12,thirty year law end sexual discrimination workplace passed equality still thin veneer many

women working in the private sector are paid less per hour than their fulltime male colleagues according to research yesterday from the equal opportunities commission it said the average hourly rate for male fulltimers is while women working fulltime average and women parttimers get jenny watson the eoc chair said the gender pay gap was unacceptable the government had legislated to tackle the problem in the public sector where pay disparities are not as glaring but ministers have no plans to make private employers follow suit women working in the private sector are being left behind in the struggle for equal pay she said ms watson called on the women at work commission to address the issue in an investigation of employment practices due to report next month the eoc analysed earnings data from the office for national statistics and found the gap between male and female fulltimers in the private sector is an hour or the gap between male fulltimers and female parttimers is or in the public sector male fulltimers average an hour against for female fulltimers and for female parttimers ms watson said the pay gap between men and women working fulltime in the private sector is nearly percentage points bigger than for public sector workers and things are even worse for women working parttime in the private sector in early there will be a new legal obligation on public sector employers to eliminate discrimination between men and women in their workforce so the risk is that in years to come the private sector pay penalty will increase still more from public sector organisations will be required to conduct a full diagnostic check on gender issues including whether women are being unfairly clustered in lowerpaid positions the women at work commission chaired by margaret prosser was set up to look at discrimination that persists years after the equal pay legislation was passed ms watson said it should look at the segregation of women into lowpaid areas of work and the lack of parttime working at senior levels,2005-12,woman working private sector paid less per hour fulltime male colleague according research yesterday equal opportunity commission said

five years ago i made a speech which i called discrimination domesticity and diversity which attempted to predict how employment law across europe would look in i anticipated some changes and advocated others to combat discrimination against women and gay people and to promote worklife balance the end of is a good time to take stock and look forward to the next years discrimination overall i was upbeat five years ago about the chances of progress and we have certainly seen it in tackling discrimination against women in employment the statutory framework is essentially in place what we need now is the will to make those rights on paper a reality for women at work despite european and domestic legislation and initiatives some of the most damaging aspects of discrimination persist a special report by the economist this year found that even though women account for almost half the workforce in western countries there are men for every woman in executive positions its a ratio that has changed little since the term glass ceiling was coined years ago the pay gap too remains despite it being illegal for over years to pay men and women differently for work of equal value there has been progress but in the last year womens pay was still of that of their male colleagues for equal value fulltime work much of the work on reducing the pay gap has focused on fulltime work but the problem is most severe among parttime staff not only are far more women working parttime of women in employment compared with of men but their male counterparts are paid more more needs to be done to combat this particularly in the effective enforcement of rights for parttime workers domesticity in it was clear there would be increasing pressure to develop more familyfriendly policies in the workplace the call for a better worklife balance was already being made fuelled in part by a small but discernible shift towards men becoming more involved in home and childcare the need for such policies is both pressing and obvious of the million people currently employed in the uk almost are parents of dependent children with of women with a child under five years old now in work one of the improvements since is that there appears to be a wide consensus that long and inflexible hours damage family life which then in a vicious circle causes low morale and worsening performance at work the government deserves credit for promoting familyfriendly policies with a step change in parental rights paid maternity leave has been doubled paid paternity leave of two weeks has been introduced maternity pay will be increased from from six to nine months by april with plans for a full year by the end of this parliament parents with children under six or who are disabled also now have a right to request flexible working there were fears that any right that required employees only to consider such a request would be meaningless but these fears have proved groundless in its first full year almost a quarter of parents of children under six asked for more flexible hours and more than threequarters of those requests were fully accepted following a recent consultation paper it seems likely this right will be extended progressively to carers of adults and parents of older children this represents real progress in supporting worklife balance and some type of familyfriendly policy can now be found in most workplaces at the end of a survey of policy and practice covering uk employees found all their employers offered some form of flexible working the challenge now is to get men as well as women to take up these new opportunities research in found men in britain already do almost a third of all childcare but they continue to work the longest hours in europe and make less use of worklife balance policies whats worse is that a recent report published by the government found those working the longest hours in the uk are men in the private sector aged with children unless men take a more active role in caring for children and make use of greater flexibility there is a danger that worklife balance policies will simply ghettoise women we will struggle to get men more involved in child rearing a crucial step to achieving true equality between the sexes if our official policies marginalise men as child carers diversity in the month when we see the first civil partnerships being celebrated we can celebrate too real progress in combating discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation an eu directive in november established a general framework for equal treatment in employment and prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the employment equality sexual orientation regulations were passed outlawing such discrimination in the uk in employment and vocational training very recently these regulations have been amended to take account of the new civil partnership arrangements now open to samesex couples these rights reflect the existing laws outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sex and race that have been extended as well to religious discrimination we now need to encourage a similar sea change in attitudes towards the rights of disabled people so they are accepted for what they are and not discriminated against for what they cannot do but i have no doubt that the hottest topic over the next few years in employment law will be age discrimination by discrimination on the grounds of age will be outlawed as it is now on the grounds of sex race and disability age discrimination with its easy and misleading generalisations remains a widespread and to a large degree accepted part of british working life as a nation we simply can no longer afford to restrict the employment opportunities available to older individuals or lose their experience and skills bringing out the crystal ball that i used in i predict that over the next five years employment law will see continued progress towards a workplace based on a revulsion against discrimination an embracing of domesticity and a deepening of respect for diversity in all its manifestations cherie booth qc practises at matrix this article was written with the help of estelle dehon of the matrix research panel breaking the mould march the issues that cherie booth predicted would shape our working lives in five years time extracts from cherie booths speech of march the paneuropean vision of labour law in the year at kings college london that improved rights to parental leave would help strike a balance between home and family it is time that men started to challenge the assumptions in the workplace that the nurturing of children has nothing to do with them our children need their male role models as well as their female ones if they are to grow up into wellrounded wellbalanced individuals that more men would take advantage of paternal leave i am pleased to report that in the prime minister of finland took advantage of his right to parental leave he has done it again recently i for one am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine example tony blair later took two weeks paternity leave when son leo was born in may that the inherent discrimination shown against women in the workplace loudly and clearly spelled out by the pay gap should be tackled the partial and if im being incredibly optimistic total closure of the pay gap will be achievable by if we all tackle it with the vigour that this form of outright discrimination against women warrants that the workplace would have to change to take more account of womens needs as would the legal system employers would need to take on and keep women in work as increasingly the health of the economy would rely on their contribution and particular skills such as customer service interpersonal skills and project management that women should have a statutory right to return to work parttime after having a baby unless her employer could justifiably claim that she needed to work fulltime that the human rights act would give gay people greater rights and protection i hope that we will see in for example john a gay man having protection against discrimination on the grounds of his sexual orientation and mary a yearold working mum earning the same percentage on a parttime basis as john and having the right to request such parttime work from a fulltime position without fear of losing her job that progress towards these goals would be helped by new legislation from europe but that they had been happily grasped with more vigour by the present government,2005-12,five year ago made speech called discrimination domesticity diversity attempted predict employment law across europe would look anticipated change advocated others combat

babies and toddlers being dropped off at nursery in the morning are often left without toys or stimulation or even at risk from lax security because there are too few staff or poor planning at the start of the day a daycare inspector will warn today amid concerns that regular nursery inspections only give a snapshot of provision usually during main operating hours when the majority of children and staff and present the early years and schools watchdog ofsted conducted a special study by arriving at a series of nurseries as they opened in the morning as early as am in some cases alarmingly for parents several nurseries overrode their security systems in busy periods in the first hour of the day because they were short of staff to monitor the entrance in three cases inspectors were allowed into the nursery without challenge a lapse ofsted deemed unacceptable in one case unvetted staff took children to the toilet and in other instances staff were under too much pressure setting up the nursery or preparing breakfast to spend time with the children ofsteds study of the experiences of children in the first hour of the day revealed that in a third of nurseries that period or longer lacked planning and organization so that children were left without toys or babies strapped into highchairs with nothing to play with the inspectors who visited a cross section of day nurseries in september also found that in one in five there were not enough staff on duty at the start of the day to offer good care for children dorian bradley one of ofsteds deputy directors is expected to tell a conference on early years inspection and regulation in london today the shortage of staff meant there was too little time for children to feel settled or to reassure parents according to the findings in some cases children were left to cry because the phone had to be answered or staff tried to manage difficult behaviour by calling across a room rather than going across to sort out the problem ofsted did find some examples of good practice with the best daycare providers planning carefully for the difficult transition from home to nursery and ensuring they have extra staff on hand to support youngsters and their parents at the start of what is for many children a very long day in the paid care of others the findings suggest care at the end of an extended day will also be of
