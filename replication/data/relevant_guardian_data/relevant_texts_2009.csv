the map of gaps a study of specialised services for women whove experienced violence across the uk published today confirms what those of us working within this sector have known for some time that provision is patchy and that many women whove experienced violence are revictimised by their subjection to a postcode lottery when it comes to accessing appropriate support as well as this it shows that specialised sexual violence provision is lagging behind the provision of domestic violence services a fact which is highlighted by the situation within the rape crisis sector in there were rape crisis centres across england and wales by there were just unsurprisingly too those areas that the report finds have the best level of provision such as bradford are those where specialised services benefit from a matrix of statutory funding sadly such areas are few and far between particularly in england and wales for example despite the world health organisations estimate that of women using uk mental health services have experienced sexual violence in their lifetimes and a survey suggesting that of women would need additional physical or mental health interventions if they were not being supported through rape crisis these services rarely benefit from health funding at the same time national and regional government increasingly plough resources that might otherwise sustain specialised voluntary services into new statutory initiatives such as sexual assault referral centres sarcs while sarcs undoubtedly perform an important function their geographical spread often makes it difficult for victims to access them and their close association with statutory authorities can make them unappealing to those who dont want to report importantly too sarcs are of little or no use to those who experienced sexual violence some time ago including the large numbers of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse plus few sarcs offer longterm support or therapeutic services yet women repeatedly put their trust in rape crisis when they are reluctant to go elsewhere largely thanks to its unique ethos when a woman approaches a rape crisis centre she can expect to be believed to have her emotions validated and to be supported in her journey to regain the control over her life and body that she feels was stolen from her by her abuser or attacker the services offered to her will also be free accessible and independent and she knows she wont be pressurised into taking particular decisions or action but perhaps most significantly she will receive womencentred services within a womenonly space it is now recognised on a national and international level by the united nations committee for the elimination of discrimination against women and by the governments own gender equality duty that genderneutral services continually fail to meet the needs of women sexual violence which is inextricable from violence against women is both a cause and a consequence of persistent gender inequality and we cannot hope to achieve substantive equality for women until we address these issues in a genderspecific way if we look to scotland we see an integrated violence against women strategy and of core funding for each individual rape crisis centre per year and if the gaps in our map are to be filled its time we recognised that the women of england and wales deserve no

at the end of we came to the end of our funding stream and despite making a great many funding applications we found we could not replace them we had to make two counsellors redundant it is very difficult to get core funding to pay the rent the salaries the bills we have a long waiting list of clients who cannot be seen immediately there was a london rape crisis centre until about six or seven years ago that closed down when they lost their funding they closed down without a blip of protest from the public no one seemed to notice it was very difficult to bring it to the publics attention who is interested in rape crisis centres unless theyve been raped its a terrible situation because we are in the voluntary sector everyone thinks that we are working for free and that we are middleaged middleclass women who want to help these poor victims the reality is that our eight paid counsellors are highly trained members of staff with degrees and diplomas in counselling and sexual violence training some have masters all have thousands of hours of experience we are working at a level equivalent to that provided by the nhs or higher the nhs doesnt offer specialist rape crisis assistance they offer shortterm courses but women who may have been abused for or years when they were children may find that six weeks of counselling is not enough sometimes we work with people for up to a year last year we saw women but also offered emergency couselling and a hour sevendayaweek telephone helpline we need a year just to tick over the home office bailed us out last year with and m was set aside for similar organisations across the country but there is no longterm security we have no stability we survive only through these ad hoc grants so we cant plan ahead we dont know if we will still be here in four years time this is a tragedy for women we do very quiet work behind the scenes i think part of the problem is that we are not loud enough we are too busy doing work counselling to enter into activism we dont have the time to engage with local government victims are not normally strong enough to tie themselves to the railings outside downing street shouting this has happened and i dont have any help survivors of sexual abuse dont want people to know what happened to them they wont be marching to whitehall there has been a backlash against the womens movement

more than councils will today be threatened with legal action over their failure to provide rape crisis centres and domestic violence support services with a strongly worded warning issued by the equality and human rights commission research reveals that one in four local authorities in britain offer no specialised services for women who have faced violence or abuse and shows that a quarter of those rape crisis centres that are still operating believe they will either have to close or radically cut services in the findings published jointly by the ehrc and the end violence against women campaign offer a stark illustration of the large areas of the country where there is now no provision at all the research shows that those services that do exist are losing their battle to secure longterm funding both from the state and from charitable sources trevor phillips chair of the ehrc said in many parts of the country services for women who have experienced violence are chronically underfunded or simply do not exist women shouldnt be subjected to this postcode lottery urgent action is needed to provide funding and support to ensure that all women can get help whenever they need it wherever they live he said he hoped the report would prompt councils to act but added for those who continue to ignore the dire need to shore up services we have a stark reminder the commission is ready and willing to use its enforcement powers the ehrc will send a letter to around local authorities giving them a month to explain why they have no provision in place if their response is unsatisfactory it intends to take legal action under the equality act which requires local authorities to promote gender equality because violence against women is such a major cause of womens inequality public bodies should ensure adequate support for women in such circumstances the ehrc said in a statement the commission will issue formal compliance notices to those local authorities that fail to address the problem and this could ultimately lead to court action vera baird the solicitor general appeared to support the ehrcs initiative and issued a statement saying there are still too many local authorities not providing support women shouldnt have to face a postcode lottery of service provision the local government association described the initiative as irresponsible and alarmist and said threatening legal action against individual councils is not going to help the situation the study highlights the patchy state of provision citing cases of victims who have been forced to make mile trips to receive counselling it shows that ethnic minority women who often require very specific services relating for example to issues such as forced marriage are especially poorly served with just of local authorities offering dedicated support the piecemeal way in which these groups have had to gather funding in the past has always made their longterm existence precarious but groups say they have found it increasingly difficult to persuade local authorities to fund their work and blame a preference for funding largescale service providers rather than small charities and a failure of central government policymakers to prioritise sexual violence support services only remain rape crisis centres remain in england and wales many of which may close soon workers in the sector claim there are more pet rescue centres than womens violence support groups yvonne traynor chief executive of londons only remaining rape crisis branch in south london said the nature of the violence made it hard to launch powerful opinionforming campaigns victims are not normally strong enough to tie themselves to the railings outside downing street shouting this has happened and i dont have any help survivors of sexual abuse dont want people to know what happened to them they wont be marching to whitehall she said adding that the branch faced closure this year unless new funding emerged although the government has increased provision of support for victims of domestic violence there has been no parallel rise in funding for rape victims the nhs offers some counselling to those victims who report attacks to the police but these are believed to be a small minority a large proportion of victims have always relied on the charitable support services and these are the groups who now find themselves without support every year an estimated million women experience rape domestic violence stalking or some other kind of abuse the ehrc said,2009-01,council today threatened legal action

in the late s a group of lesbians in leeds known as revolutionary feminists rfs made a controversial move that resonated loudly for me and many other women they began calling for all feminists to embrace lesbianism appealing to their heterosexual sisters to get rid of men from your beds and your heads they started a debate which reached its height in with the publication of an infamous booklet love your enemy the debate between heterosexual feminism and political lesbianism lye in this the rfs wrote that all feminists can and should be lesbians our definition of a political lesbian is a womanidentified woman who does not fuck men it does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women the message of lye immediately provoked a strong and often negative reaction while some radical feminists agreed with the groups arguments many went wild at being told they were counterrevolutionaries undermining the fight for womens liberation by sleeping with men the main author of lye sheila jeffreys says that the backlash to the booklet even among lesbians was quite shocking quite a few were angry with the group for writing it they felt it exposed them to hostility from outraged heterosexual feminists its no surprise that the booklet was so controversial we think serious feminists have no choice but to abandon heterosexuality it reads only in the system of oppression that is male supremacy does the oppressor actually invade and colonise the interior of the body of the oppressed it also asserted that penetration is more than a symbol its function and effect is the punishment and control of women tina crockett was one of the rfs who gathered in a holiday cottage in the yorkshire dales to write lye she says that while the booklets insistence that lesbianism could be a choice was controversial debate was equally heated around the suggestion that men were the enemy we were trying to challenge the excuses used by some heterosexual feminists as to why they lived with nigel or john she says they said oh but my man is ok as a way of refusing to look at the fact that some men really do hate women alison garthwaite was another of the authors and she stands by the original argument sexuality is not determined by a gene which we are born with she says it can change over time and is determined by both your circumstances and the choices you make garthwaite is keen to reassure heterosexual feminists however that their role in feminism is not redundant or unwanted perhaps the original paper implied that heterosexual feminists were of no use and that they need not bother i dont think that both crockett and garthwaite can see why lye upset people the arguments in lye were a stick of dynamite up a very cosy feminist convention says crockett that heterosexual feminists must never be criticised for choosing men over women the publication of lye was the one of the first times that the notion of sexuality as a choice had been publicly raised in the uk womens movement many feminists considered sexuality purely a matter of personal desire and the idea that lesbianism could be a political decision was perceived as coldblooded they believed that one did not choose sexual orientation or feelings but was overcome by them says jeffreys one could accept them or struggle against them but not manufacture them the feminist writer bea campbell was one of lyes many detractors arguing that it was far more important to challenge mens behaviour in heterosexual relationships than to insist that women abandon hope altogether the notion of political lesbianism is crazy she says it erased desire it was founded therefore not on love of women but fear of men another feminist critic was the academic lynne segal who has written in celebration of heterosexuality for me coming into feminism at the beginning of the s political lesbianism was the main position advanced by a tiny band of vanguardist women she says its stance was tragic because no all men were not the enemy she adds that the media used lye to trash feminism in general that inevitably added to the bitterness we felt both then and ever since for all those who bridled at its message though there were women who took the arguments in lye to heart the booklet described lesbianism in glowing terms which was quite something back in the s after all out women still face prejudice and exclusion just yesterday the sun used the pejorative lesbo in a headline about icelands interim pm some women threw out boyfriends and husbands after taking note of claims such as this being a heterosexual feminist is like being in the resistance in nazioccupied europe where in the daytime you blow up a bridge in the evening you rush to repair it others such as myself found that the arguments in lye spoke directly to feelings that had already been developing opponents of political lesbianism argue that genuine lesbians are motivated purely by lust towards women rather than a decision to reject men and heterosexuality for me however my lesbianism is intrinsically bound up with my feminist politics and my campaigning against sexual violence when i was growing up on a council estate in darlington the expectation was that i would one day marry a local boy settle down and start producing kids frankly the thought horrified me i was surrounded by men my father and two brothers and at an early age i had picked up on the stories of domestic violence child abuse and general unhappiness that seemed to emanate from neighbouring households i was also struck by the drudgery on display while men were out drinking embarking on fishing trips and generally enjoying their freedom women were stuck cooking for them cleaning for them and running around after children for women heterosexuality seemed a total con at then having only ever had one nonserious boyfriend i came out as a lesbian three years later i moved to leeds in search of the scarysounding feminists i had heard about and having joined a group that campaigned against pornography finally met the rfs they engaged me in discussions about heterosexuality in the pub and critiquing this mainstream sexual culture made sense to me after all the women i had met during my childhood clearly hadnt benefited from it the rfs told me that to them lesbianism was a choice that women could make and not a condition we are born with all women can be lesbians was the mantra i loved the sense that i had chosen my sexuality and rather than being ashamed or apologetic about it as many women were i could be proud and see it as a privilege many of those who embraced political lesbianism in the s and s still keep the faith today for jeffreys for instance the arguments in lye are as relevant now as they were years ago we made the decision to become lesbians because loving and fighting for women was the centre of our lives and for me it still is it made little sense to spend our whole time working for womens liberation and to then go home to men crockett also says she stands by the sentiments in the paper but wishes it had not only focused on the negative aspects of heterosexuality we should have said come on in the waters lovely because actually it is really great fun being a lesbian to me political lesbianism continues to make intrinsic sense because it reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice and we are not destined to a particular fate because of our chromosomes i also suspect that it is very difficult to spend your daily life fighting against male violence only to share a bed with a man come the evening then theres the fact that working with women towards a common goal means you develop a strong and passionate bond with them why some feminists then block out the possibility of sexual relationships with their political sisters and instead turn to men for intimacy is beyond me i think its time for feminists to reopen the debate about heterosexuality and to embrace the idea of political lesbianism we live in a culture in which rape is still an everyday reality and yet women are blamed for it as it is viewed as an inevitable feature of heterosexual sex domestic violence is still a chronic problem for countless women in relationships with men women are told we must love our oppressors while as feminists we fight to end the power afforded them as a birthright come on sisters you know it makes sense stop pretending you think lesbianism is an exclusive members club and join the ranks i promise that you will not regret it,2009-01,late group lesbian leeds known revolutionary feminist rf made

when kathy lette first began to approach some of this countrys most seasoned women writers to contribute to the collection of short erotic stories she was editing she was surprised by how many of them promptly exercised their right to say no this despite the fact that she was guaranteeing their anonymity all authors in the recently published in bed with have adopted noms de porn the name of their first pet put with that of their first street lette is happy to admit that theres a fair measure of mischiefmaking underpinning her project and easily moistened mostly male gossip columnists are already intent on unmasking marmalade bates as fay weldon or is it esther freud but nor is this slinky volume without its politics as lette notes its a weary truism that it remains taboo for women to talk publicly about what turns them on another of the contributors joan smith says she has been fielding scandalised callers demanding to know why a feminist such as herself would even countenance writing erotica for all the jocular gloss the medias imperative to identify lettes writers carries an unpleasant undercurrent of the scarlet letter and it reminds me too much of the meanspirited outing a few years ago of the formidable zoe margolis whose sex blog girl with a onetrack mind was not only very hot but chockfull of feminism one woman writing about sex who does not require any further exposure is charlotte roche a german tv presenter whose first novel wetlands became a literary sensation when it was published last year now translated and available in britain next month roches heroine helen is joyfully promiscuous while showing complete disregard for the traditional demands of feminine hygiene she is childishly fascinated by the smell and taste of her own body particularly her vagina rebelling against the received wisdom of how women should be kempt down there wetlands has divided critics in germany is this a grand feminist manifesto or selfregarding obscenity after reading it myself last week id offer that while a whole lot more explicit than in bed with it shares a very similar ethos not least because it subverts the usual conventions of pornography by portraying a female and indeed male sexual protagonist who is less than perfectly plucked and permanently aroused the couplings in the lette collection include elderly liaisons as well as the requisite strapping gardener and bored housewife there is reason to be cheerful about this flurry of midwinter temperatureraising perhaps ive been looking in all the wrong places but it has struck me lately that public debate about good sex has stalled some three years ago now the american writer ariel levy identified a prevailing raunch culture which puts forward poledancing lessons and nostrings liaisons as evidence of liberation when in reality women are constrained as ever but this time fearful of being branded prudish instead of promiscuous women and men were becoming increasingly vocal about their anger at the way sexuality still mainly female had been coopted by commerce with the values of the market turning the act itself into a competitive sport for a moment it felt as though in addition to critiquing the pornification of society it might be possible to open up a public space to investigate how this was affecting personal sexual development but i sense this didnt quite happen despite the blogosphere offering individuals like margolis ample opportunity to explore their own erotic journeys sexual ignorance is far from bliss yet we still dont know for example precisely how a woman reaches orgasm while its generally assumed that men have higher libidos recent research from canada found that women are physiologically aroused by a much wider range of stimuli than males and while the porn movie industry has entirely mainstreamed anal penetration i dont see the pshe curriculum teaching our young people how to make the act safer and more comfortable by using condoms and lube any time soon if this debate is still to take place then rewriting porn is a pretty good place to start as smith summed up in a recent column about her contribution to in bed with the problem isnt sex but the fact that the industry thats grown up around it is sadistic humiliating and exploitative and the vast bulk of its consumers are men there is a danger here that the debate becomes zerosum this is not about replacing one stereotyped version of human sexuality ie male homogenised fuckcentric bad with another ie female politically correct cuddlecentric boring were

john updike got an unfair rap as a sexist but he was a misogynist or so his fiction reads he hated this about himself so far as one can tell from his extreme touchiness on the subject it didnt seem like the indignation of someone defending himself against injustice but the fury of someone caught out i suspect he would have been touchy and angry about any criticism it all goes back to the mother i say on the basis of almost no facts i admit it at the outset i had the most minimal of dealings with updike but the very first one was over the sexism issue or his touchiness about it in the s when i published a piece in an american magazine no longer extant called saturday review about barbara pym quoting a line from an updike review of one of her books why should he care about a piece by an obscure writer in a dying magazine in which a merely mildly negative sentence by him was quoted it is about being put off by the chilliness of pyms solitaries the books pivotal character is a spinster who hoards food and starves herself it was not unreasonable to be put off he wrote a furious letter to the editor complaining of being quoted out of context and proclaiming his admiration for pym i wrote back entirely conceding the admiration but also quoting the doggerel hed written to end that review of two books the other by stanislaw lem pym and lem pym and lem you hug yourself instead of them didnt seem unfair and i didnt think hed been unfair yet when i was introduced to him a few years later at a party he absolutely pounced youre the one he howled the man who introduced us kindly pulled the great one away and i was left figuratively shaking in my shoes it wasnt because of reasonable reservations about a female writer or even the fact that he reviewed many many more books by men than women that feminists spotlighted him as sexist or that female readers choked a little on his novels and stories it was the way he depicted women it was the way he described them us you felt yourself squirming wanting to pull a blanket over you preferably leadlined to shield yourself from the merest stray phrase or casual observation not because they were sexual and incited ones modesty it was not like being stripped it was like being splayed open on the examining table under the glare of medical lamps while satirical remarks were made it was being seen looming with comic grotesqueness through a telescope it was the most unfriendly leering by someone saying you see you see how could anyone love that it left you figuratively shaking in your shoes or at least hoping that the men in your own life werent secretly seeing you that way as a collection of compelling sexual organs the possession of which doomed you to ridiculeworthy tastes and concerns the hint of mockery in the descriptions is more painful than the little trill of hate you hate what has power over you you mock it to deprive it of power as he always was in prose updike was subtle nuanced a genius in these manifestations of his apparent fear and unease it was also at the time he became john updike perfectly ok with the powers that were to see women this way im sure it puzzled him the backlash after all his men are no princes those twotimers and evaders those so blatantly not standup guys but we see on the whole through their eyes for instance heres janice rabbits wife as he comes home from work in the first chapter of rabbit run the book that assured updike a place in american letters she is a small woman whose skin tends toward olive and looks tight as if something swelling inside is straining against her littleness just yesterday it seems to him she stopped being pretty these tiny advances into age have occurred imperceptibly so it seems just possible that tomorrow theyll be gone and shell be his girl again what struck me looking at the passage this morning is the way whatever she is she is it for him for rabbit for the man for all we know updike was nothing like rabbit but there it is theres not a whiff of empathy its not even a possibility janice will be rabbits girl if she can reverse ageing and being his girl is the sum of her possible worth that he sees her this way is not presented critically moments later she wants to smoke and he wonders how anyone could think of smoking with his stomach on edge the way it is he wonders this with the total occluded subjectivity of a narcissist how could she want to smoke with his stomach feeling the way it does etcetera which seems to me very much the childs anger at a mother who failed to see his needs and he is likely to punish that mother by hurting every woman he encounters for the rest of his life updike writes perfectly knowingly not trying to make rabbit out as any hero but rabbit does come off if you can swallow his perceptions of the women as justified besides he is our pointofview character you have to sympathise with him and that is precisely what is unpalatable for female readers one doesnt feel this way reading about levins dilemmas in anna karenina or even karenins the husband of anna we can unreservedly feel for why anna comes to loathe him and yet still feel for him maybe just because we get both points of view but certainly because a reader cant help feeling what all tolstoys characters feel the character of janice we can only guess what she feels and were not encouraged to well its a young mans book updike struggled with what he must have recognised as his central failing for this reader he didnt master it by making women protagonists in later books or anything that programmatic for myself i was happiest reading him in his stories of childhood and revisiting childhood scenes that was where he really wanted to undo time that was where he most wanted to penetrate,2009-01,john

while it may be true that there are fewer women who identify as feminists these days theres still very little doubt that most of us actually are ask any young woman who spits out feminism like its a dirty word if she genuinely believes herself to be inferior to men and therefore less deserving of rights than those gifted with a male appendage at birth and the chances are shell scoff and tell you not to be so ridiculous we may not have overthrown the patriarchy just yet or managed to sell feminism as a badge to be worn with pride but at the very least weve managed to imbue in the majority of women the sense that were as entitled to the same freedoms and opportunities as the rest of the human race so whether they call themselves feminists or not women arent about to go quietly back into the kitchens anytime soon and as for accepting the secondclass citizenship status our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers had to endure those days are long gone for most of us anyway unfortunately as in any movement for social change there are those who remain resistant to their own emancipation a tiny minority who have been so indoctrinated by both gender and religious conditioning that they continue to see themselves as mens subordinates these women defer to their men in all things they believe their primary role in life is to produce children and to keep a tidy and happy home and while they enjoy all the benefits that feminism has brought them like the right to vote the right to contraception and the right to escape their miserable marriages once the penny drops and they finally wake up to the drudgery that their lives have become they regard feminists like me as the antichrist these stepford wives dont hesitate in denouncing the work of womens liberationists down the ages while at the same time failing to recognise that if it hadnt been for that work they wouldnt now be enjoying the freedom to speak out about anything in october last year about of these selfhating collaborators flocked to chicago to take part in the true woman conference an event described by kathryn joyce on alternet as a stadiumstyle event to promote what its proponents call biblical womanhood complementarianism or most bluntly the patriarchy movement the patriarchy movement is yet another brand of evangelical antifeminism a bit like the quiverfull movement only this time without all the children biblical womanhood does exactly what it says on the tin it sends women back to the dark ages at the true woman conference for example the christian sisters launched their new manifesto inspiringly titled the true woman manifesto where they resolved to cultivate such virtues as purity modesty submission meekness and love and where they affirmed their calling as women to encourage men as they seek to express godly masculinity and to honour and support godordained male leadership in the home and in the church its heartening to see that so far fewer than women around the globe have signed up to this misogynists charter but its also depressing to think that women think so little of themselves and their daughters that theyre prepared to endorse such illiberal antiwoman nonsense and the patriarchy movers arent alone in selfproclaimed feminist laura doyle brightened up the lives of poor downtrodden men everywhere with the launch of her book the surrendered wife a step by step guide to finding intimacy passion and peace with your man in which she called on married women to cede control to men in the domestic sphere as a means to achieving marital harmony according to doyle modern women have become too nagging shrewish and belittling towards the men in our lives and rather than telling our husbands to stop moaning shape up or ship out if they cant handle a bit of dust on top of the telly and are seemingly incapable of doing anything about it themselves instead were supposed to mollycoddle them and treat them as if our semidetached suburban chalet bungalows are really castles and theyre the kings over all they survey including us forget that most women now work just as many hours outside of the home as their menfolk or if they dont its because theyre stuck indoors with the kids all day when hubbie gets home were supposed to have recovered ourselves from all that were supposed to be waiting graciously by the front door with his slippers at the ready with a candlelit bath already drawn upstairs and a hot meal on standby in the oven for when he comes down suffice to say theres as much chance of me signing up for one of the rapidly spawning surrendered wives workshops as there is of me visiting a nail bar or baking cup cakes for the local wi and then theres the taken in hand crowd the most bizarre and disturbing bunch of the lot when i first came across taken in hand or tih as its sometimes known i have to admit i thought it was some kind of bdsm offshoot but regretfully its not its a monogamous heterosexual relationship which is maleled and in which the female defers in matters of everyday life as well as sexually to her partner this by itself isnt too problematic not if both partners are consenting and go into the relationship fully aware of what theyre signing up to but which a quick glance around their website shows is nowhere near as loving decent and kind as the publicity tries to make out taken in handers practise what they call consensual nonconsent which basically boils down to physical and sexual chastisement up to and including rape as punishment for the womans transgressions it apparently doesnt matter if she screams and cries throughout her ordeal no amount of pleading is going to make the punishment stop by dint of the fact that shes in the relationship in the first place shes deemed to have consented to any mistreatment and abuse her husband doles out im not providing a link to the article but any movement that tries to make a case for when rape is a gift deserves nothing but contempt and not just from feminists whats clear from all these groups is that no matter how much progress women make towards achieving equal rights there are always going to be those among us who are too invested in the patriarchy to welcome that progress with open arms thats up to them but lets be clear about one thing no matter how many of these oddball antifeminist backwardlooking movements spring up womens advancement is going one way and one way only even if a million women sign the true woman charter or if only a handful of women ever choose to identify as feminists womens rights are nonnegotiable weve already come this far and were not going back without a fight,2009-01,may true fewer woman identify feminist day still little doubt u actually ask young

that misogyny still plagues the american news media is not up for debate at least not among people with the merest faculty for critical thought the basic ability to count the numbers of men and women hosting reporting and guesting on news shows or even in possession of eyes or ears and the capacity to point themselves in the direction of msnbcs daily politics show hardball chris matthews is a repeat offender failing on many days to get through an entire hour of his show without making an ignorant or overtly prejudiced comment about women he leers at his colleagues gropes other talkshow hosts debates whether ann coulter is hot makes tired castrating feminist jokes refuses to confront sexism on his own show and has been routinely disrespectful or overtly hostile to hillary clinton and other women in politics eric boehlert has documented that misogyny is in fact a pretty sweet business for matthews yesterdays show was no exception as matthews discussed the stimulus package or as he calls it here obamas big package with robert wexler a democratic congressman from florida complaining that the money allocated for family planning is just a bunch of odds and ends and cats and dogs congressman wexler why isnt it just why isnt it just what we thought it was going to beinfrastructure roads bridges stuff that everybody agrees on needs to be fixed and creates real jobs for real people that pay decent salaries why dont we spend all the money on that stuff that people can see rather than all these odds and ends and cats and dogs according to matthews the only thing real people can see are infrastructure projects and the jobs they create which as has been pointed out by linda hirshman and discussed by echidne here are jobs that will disproportionately benefit men funding for family planning arguably primarily benefits women rendering it in matthews estimation a pointless waste of money subsequently after wexler explains that family planning saves if done correctly an enormous sum of money down the road in the healthcare system matthews ignores wholly that planned and wanted children born to nonaddicted women who seek out prenatal care are generally healthier children dismisses out of hand the importance of choice and instead accuses wexler and by extension the democrats of advocating a policy of reducing the number of births im for abortion as a right and all that its all right but why should the federal government have a policy of reducing the number of births i dont know why the federal government has an interest in that they have an interest in freedom and people making choices but i just heard a case made by congressman wexler that it was in the national interest to have fewer kids i dont understand that it sounds a little like china he notes conflating the democrats plan to provide women a breadth of reproductive choices with a statemandated reproductive limitation which has resulted in the mass murder and abandonment of female infants its like a crpe of misogyny double the deliciousness with a flaky pancake of ignorance wrapped around a gooey inside of unapologetic enmity that matthews misogyny infects his work is not just problematic because it leaves viewers with any sense of egalitarianism and fairness reaching for the remote it also makes him flatly bad at his job its factually incorrect that the democrats proposal is anything like china and its an authentically retrograde opinion to hold that funding family planning is not an essential expenditure reflective of someone profoundly out of touch with the realities of modern american womens lives experiences and needs and as we speak matthews has opened tonights show on the same note everything about the news is old again in the hands of mr hardball there is an inherent conflict in someone presenting the news root word new and clinging defiantly and pathetically to opinions of women that were already old when i was born nearly years ago put him out to

in a postfeminist world some might have thought that the notion of sisterhood was dead ceilings have been broken now and with the job market the way it is well you have to fight some battles on your own babe in actual fact the connecting thread between women feels stronger but more abrasive than ever in her book how to meet a man after forty and other midlife dilemmas the columnist shane watson touches on something that has nothing to do with her tips for meeting men which can be summed up as every hair on your body needs treating either by removal or blowdry and everything to do with women in order to be a contender she writes at all times you must keep an eye on the progress of your contemporaries these days you dont think ok thats her life because she is who she is and shes married to a hedge fund manager you simply keep adding to the list of things you must do in order to compete rare is the womens magazine that doesnt inform readers how quickly a celebrity lost her baby weight as though it were simultaneously something for which to hate the celebrity and hate themselves blame helen mirren for looking so hot in a bikini in her s watson writes the furore over french politician rachida dati and her fiveday maternity leave was the most perfect example of this tendency many women felt that dati was letting the side down it was a toxic inversion of that s slogan about the personal becoming political datis personal choice about her life and that of her baby was seen as a political statement but dati never held herself up as a female icon who sets the bars for womens behaviour and maybe its time some women stopped looking at other women in a purely narcissistic deeply emotional manner after all i have yet to read an article written by a man wailing that a male politician came back too soon after his hernia operation the response to this is that women still have to work harder in all areas of life and so its only natural that what other women do impacts on the expectations of other women yet the only people ive ever heard or seen make this claim are in fact women the only people who wrote about dati were women watson is a woman maybe men are just staying cannily silent but i feel hardpressed to imagine any sentient man altering his expectations of what his pregnant wife should look like after seeing some photographs of angelina jolie this idea that what one woman does impacts on all women was once used as a source of female encouragement if she could be the head of a bank you could too if she could leave her husband at the age of and travel across india on her own you could too now it feels like a hammer with which women berate each other under the guise of telling it like it is magazine columnists may write about how we all feel like failures next to nigella lawson as if it were a given but such suppositions are as misogynist as the prefeminist world because they assume women see themselves as one anxious lump seething with mutual hatred and suspicion with a bit of luck maybe there will be a catfight who knows how many women feel insecure about their mothering techniques after looking at photos of jolie but i strongly suspect that being told they should do by magazine columnists doesnt help the whole point of feminism was to give women freedom to live their lives as individuals whether it meant working parenting or having five days or five months of maternity leave if id known it meant glowering angrily at each other personally i would have saved my bra from the fire and just gone back to the office

you might assume that being made redundant when youre on maternity leave is illegal but youd be wrong though the law gives women some protection its still perfectly legal for employers to give new mothers the boot while theyre off claiming their job is no longer required so what about dads who choose to take advantage of their parental leave entitlement when their baby is born all parents can now take up to four weeks off unpaid over the course of a year to care for a child add on two weeks statutory paternity leave throw in a fortnights holiday and bingo youre off work for a couple of months once your babys made its appearance the three main political parties are proposing in different formats to make even more extended periods of leave a statutory right for new fathers but as my partner richard discovered recently after the birth of our son some men could find themselves out of a job just when they think theyre heading back to the office our plan was always that richard would take several months unpaid sabbatical a perk of his terms and conditions so we could share the childcare in those precious early days after discussions with his employer who was amenable but slightly scoffing and clearly thought it was an odd sort of notion for a man to want to look after a baby richard notes five months leave was agreed a matter of days before he was due to start back at work he was informed that his position was likely to be made redundant it feels as though richards extended period of paternity leave was used as a way of getting rid of a longstanding and therefore relatively expensive member of staff men have essentially the same rights as women on maternity leave employers must be scrupulously careful not to target anyone on parental leave for dismissal if no genuine redundancy exists warns emma hawksworth employment partner at solicitors russell jones amp walker compensation is theoretically unlimited in sex discrimination cases which is how false redundancy linked to parental leave is construed employers of course wont be daft enough to cite paternity leave as a reason for redundancy so proving it is always going to be difficult as it has typically been for women made redundant during or just after their maternity leave employees also go to tribunal at their own cost even if they win there is no legal aid for this type of claim richard is fighting the redundancy on the grounds that his work responsibilities have not diminished or changed despite ironically his employers prior agreement to his request for flexible working following his leave period meaning he now works four rather than five days per week his union agrees that an inadequate case is being made for the redundancy but the parallels with womens experience of maternity leave are not encouraging as hawksworth points out the legal protections of maternity leave dont always match up to what happens in reality it is very common for a company to restructure during a womans maternity leave and sometimes she turns out to be the only one made redundant according to a survey of dads by parenting website netmums of men said their ideal scenario would be to share childcare with their partner while both worked flexibly however the same survey showed that only actually manage it and in a survey of readers for fq magazine of men said they thought taking extended paternity leave would adversely affect their career however some employers are demonstrating how men can successfully integrate their roles as employees and fathers matthew ellis an it project manager for fujitsu services says his company bent over backwards to accommodate his request for an extended period of leave he requested three weeks off after the birth and six months later he was allowed to use weeks from his parental leave entitlement plus three weeks holiday to go travelling as a family the benefits are not just an enhanced relationship with his daughter he says but also a better appreciation of the work mothers traditionally do striking this kind of deal requires open and honest discussions about how to make the leave work for both parties advises patrick meades a director at pricewaterhousecoopers when he discovered his wife was expecting twins he knew it would be helpful to take more than the statutory two weeks off so he chatted with his manager and two months leave was mutually agreed i got to be much more part of the way we work things at home which means i can do more to take the pressure off he says now back at work four days a week after subsequent negotiations about flexible working does meades feel he is perceived as uncommitted not at all there are partners here who work parttime he says if it means my progression is delayed then im happy to take a bit more time it could take men a generation to really feel comfortable about taking longer paternity leave reckons nic sale head of diversity at business psychologist pearn kandola one of the biggest obstacles is macho corporate cultures she says that means its very difficult to implement changes when it comes to childcare unlike in the nordic countries which value in both men and women more traditionally feminine nurturing qualities though we dont yet know the outcome of richards proposed redundancy the whole episode has he says provided a sharp lesson in the risks that working mothers have faced for a long time i think other men in my company might well look at what happened and think well he took time off to be with his new baby and was made redundant do i want to do the same hmm too risky had he known what was in store would he make the same choices yes because having that time with my son is something ill treasure forever he says but im left feeling angry because its not a risk that anyone should have to take names have been changed paternity rights currently two weeks paternity leave at or around the time of the birth paid at the statutory paternity

described how one of her first studies into child abuse found that one in two women reported some instance of intimate intrusion before the age of these were mostly isolated incidents of flashing or attempts at sexual coercion by a boyfriend by her estimate only one in or of those cases involved ongoing sexual abuse by an adult male family member and yet we quote these figures one in two one in four one in whatever as if it means serious ongoing abuse always and it doesnt its exactly the same with domestic violence figures yes one in two one in three one in four in whatever survey in different countries have had an incident at some point in their lives thats not the same as the pattern of coercive control which is what i mean by domestic violence there are complicated issues about what these measurements mean and we need to be more accurate and more careful when we invoke them being clear that we do so in an accurate and not an inaccurate way the figures do say something accurate but we sometimes stretch that to mean something that it doesnt seldom a week goes by without a new illustration of kellys vital point perhaps the most notorious and common example concerns the estimates contained in the world banks world development report pdf of the global health burden of genderbased violence using a complex and controversial economic construct called the disability adjusted life year these estimates were simplified into a neat little table by the researcher lori heise in which placed domestic violence and rape as the sixth most damaging condition to women aged worldwide however an important footnote explained that this had been added for illustrative purposes only violence and rape are causes of morbidity such as posttraumatic mental health problems physical injury and stds not conditions in themselves therefore they should really be compared to other causative factors of morbidity not to illnesses such as cancer and heart disease heise as she admitted herself was simply not comparing like with like nonetheless her factoid has been endlessly repeated and wildly distorted ever since ive seen heises interpretation of the world banks estimates quoted as saying that genderbased violence is one of the leading causes of mortality not morbidity worldwide seen the same figures attributed to domestic violence alone instead of to all genderbased offences and recently read that it is the main cause of death and disability globally for women aged to rape and gross bodily violence cause more death and permanent disability than cancer motor vehicle accidents war and malaria combined my emphasis this is an extreme example of statistical legerdemain but there are countless others the reasons are often understandable when we find a statistic that appears to support the case we wish to make it is very tempting to swoop on it without too much effort to verify the source sometimes dodgy stats stem from careless misreading or misunderstanding of the numbers but in others they originate in studies of little or no credibility in the first place seemingly served up to order by research companies to meet the agenda of a campaign group or media outlet last week panorama based its expos of sexual bullying in schools around a commissioned survey pdf using methodology and statistical reporting that would see any undergraduate social scientist laughed out of college the same or much worse could be said of the womens aidbliss magazine survey on a similar topic which appeared to commit many methodological errors including the cardinal sin of using selfselected respondents these surveys have no more authority than any of the exercises in prgenerated churnalism that reveal for example that people are willing to trade their computer passwords for a chocolate bar of course the misuse and abuse of statistics is by no means the preserve of feminists the government is undoubtedly the most serious serial offender as the report from the uk statistics authority demonstrated last week environmentalists human rights campaigners advocates for and against immigration and just about anyone who has ever campaigned for anything will probably have a cynical or careless offence against statistics somewhere on their record myself included so ultimately does it matter if campaigners and commentators play fast and loose it might be argued that if global warming or domestic violence is a deadly important issue then presenting the most dramatic and compelling statistics can help the cause and save lives even if they do not entirely reflect reality furthermore the first thing anyone learns about statistics is disraelis triumvirate of falsehood while the classic text on the subject is called how to lie with statistics nobody believes far less understands statistics anyway do they well they should social science is imperfect and unreliable in many ways but it still provides the only tatty map we have to the labyrinth of society without quantification and analysis we are looking at the world through a long thin tube that said for statistics to be valuable they have to be treated with extreme caution and suspicion they are powerful important and can be very dangerous if used carelessly what angers me most about the use of advocacy stats in politics and the media is not the mistakes and the misunderstandings but the disrespect when a campaign produces invalid research to gain support when a journalist misrepresents credible research to make his case or when a politician ignores findings that fail to support her policy they do themselves no favours to quote the guardian readers editor with thousands of potential factcheckers out there writers who cite studies reports and league tables in support should fully expect to be called upon to produce them misquoting a statistic is as unethical and reprehensible as misquoting a witness we can all check sources these days often within a few seconds and claimants credibility can be shot to pieces along with the argument they are trying to make if they havent done so themselves such behaviour devalues degrades and undermines even the best and most honest quantitative research it also risks sending policymakers down wrong turns bad data mean bad policy which inevitably means worse governance and a worse society i leave you with the wise

one wonders whether french justice minister rachida dati could have foreseen the almost entirely female media furore that greeted her when she sashayed out in her stilettoes to return to work a mere five days after having her first baby a girl zohra by caesarean section the main criticism was that by playing superwoman by opting for a quasimacho show of strength she had undermined the very concept of maternity leave for ordinary women that by playing the unstoppable card she had done womankind a disservice by making them look feeble fakers drips for wanting to use their own leave really to my mind dati certainly undermined women but not because of any show of strength in reality just by insisting on that ridiculously early return dati gave a masterclass in feminine weakness it isnt hard to understand the feminist anger towards dati now presumably cast for all time as the mummy judas one of the most galling aspects of all this is what manna from pinstripe heaven it will be to the alan sugars of this parish confirming an entrenched corporate belief that female maternity leave is an expensive inconvenience a pc luxury even a pisstake at the very least runs the rationale its pathetic dont women in africa pop them out and instantly return to cutting corn with a newborn in one arm and a scythe in the other well sorry to poop the misogynist party but as sarah brown was trying to get across last year the reality in developing countries with little or no postnatal care is a horrendously high mortality rate for mother and child in the west where we cosseted whingers are allowed beds and painkillers i cant have been the only one to wince at the sight of dati in her im back world suit and perhaps dont f me just yet stilettoes having had caesareans ourselves some of us are painfully aware that the staples binding her scar are unlikely to be out yet that dati is probably still bleeding and that her milk will have arrived a polite way of saying your breasts are on fire all this and dati is and its her first baby is it really so reductive to feel that she might be better off back home bonding with zohra rather than faxing though her maternal devotion one would think not but still none of this touches upon the main reason why dati has let women down by returning to work so soon namely the suspicion that far from being a display of dynamism it is all about fear and insecurity about her job and a desperate alltoo female desire to impress and please indeed it seems likely that dati was too wary or if you want to be harsh cowardly to take the time she was due and while some might argue that its a matter of personal choice it remains disappointing just as its important to win rights such as maternity leave it is crucial for women to have the guts to use them a truly strong character would unlike dati have taken every second of her allotted leave just like a man its odd then to keep seeing dati described as behaving like a man bar a few cartoon macho city types this isnt male behaviour you only have to look at our unequal pay to realise that men tend to know their rights and their worth indeed last week of all weeks nick clegg was heard suggesting that new fathers fathers are given a year off is this where were heading a world where men get given more leave while women are too insecure to take their own it wasnt by being superwoman that dati let working women down it was by being a complete wimp torys callous madeleine prank shouldnt surprise us matthew lewis an area chairman for the young tory group conservative future has been discovered bragging to friends on facebook about dressing up as madeleine mccann for a fancy dress party in a series of exchanges it was decided he needed pink pyjamas a blonde wig a teddy bear and a phial of fake blood to complete the costume at one point lewis worried he had gone too far but then comforted himself that there was a baby p at the same party the young tories really know how to cut a rug dont they condemned from all sides not least by his own party lewis left his post and apologised to madeleines family as well he should the moronic insensitive twerp whether he should be public enemy number one is another matter the fact that a child is involved makes this that much more disgusting but there is nothing new about sick fancy dress costumes based on famous news stories or real people alive or dead this sort of thing is par for the course in america where halloween is awash with dead dianas or heathers missing leg nor is sick fancy dress so uncommon here look at prince harry in his afrika korps getup moreover in the case of madeleine havent we all been asking for it madeleine is a vulnerable child whose parents have been devastated by her disappearance yet the fact remains that maddie the concept the brand has been fully absorbed into british culture for some time while this must be hard on kate and gerry mccann it is also a sign that their campaign was extraordinarily successful so successful that a culture of oversensitivity has long swirled in the slipstream indeed thinking about it how was it ever possible to turn this tragic little girl into a media celebrity without her image being up for grabs for every merchant of bad taste the tories are right to be embarrassed by lewiss actions his prank was unfunny and callous however only the mccanns can justify being upset by it as for the rest of us we reap what we sow you can wipe that smile off your face right now van please dont panic there have been reports that van misery guts morrison has been spotted smiling broadly on the cover of his new album a live performance of astral weeks recorded at the hollywood bowl for those unfamiliar with vans little ways this incident is equivalent to ann widdecombe mooning legend has it that the last time van morrison smiled methuselah smiled back people are so perturbed by this development there is a rumour running around internet sites that the smile must have been photoshopped on to morrisons face however van has confirmed that the smile is his own as he was so happy to perform the songs at the hollywood bowl ok maybe we should panic has van realised a mere odd years into his career that a little irish charm might be useful for shifting units what about all the other times he performed live or recorded albums where was laughing boy then all highly facetious of course its possible morrison has smiled a couple more times in his life and work its just that we dont care to hear about it we dont like the famous to subvert our image of them after all these years vans miserable auld cur demeanour is part of the deal and without it we feel shortchanged after all johnny man in black cash didnt suddenly start twirling about in pink

the social science researcher social worker and activist kate cavanagh who has died of cancer aged worked in the areas of domestic violence child abuse and rape she spent her life trying to understand extreme forms of violence in order to work towards their prevention the daughter of adeline and john cavanagh kate was born in the gorbals area of glasgow after leaving holyrood secondary school she began studying business at glasgow college of commerce and distribution as well as taking up a clerks post with the gas board saving her wages to go hitchhiking around europe in she enrolled at the new university of stirling where we first met we were lecturers in the sociology department newly arrived from the us and kate was the student all lecturers hope to have bright sparkling and intellectually curious she graduated in but stayed on as a research assistant to help with our studies of the newly discovered issue of battered wives after a oneyear pilot focusing on the plight of women and children fleeing to the recently opened refuges in edinburgh and glasgow which became a part of a newly formed organisation scottish womens aid we were granted funding for a full study to be conducted by ourselves and two research assistants one of whom would be kate and the other a fellow student monica wilson our research collaborations and personal friendship lasted more than three decades and survived the challenges of three large and demanding investigations into violence our team conducted more than interviews with abused women and examined more than police records at the time very little was known about the problem and we all hoped that providing greater knowledge about the plight of abused women and their children and the responses of the justice system would contribute to efforts to end this form of violence using the findings kate wrote an msc thesis battered women and social control and we combined them with historical and crosscultural material about wife beating in the book violence against wives in kate joined leicestershire county council as an unqualified social worker and over the next eight years obtained a second masters degree in social work from the university of warwick and a certificate of qualification in social work she was also appointed guardian ad litem in litigation for derbyshire helped establish a voluntary hostel for women with housing needs and became the authoritys first research social worker kate and her partner graeme moved to edinburgh in and had two children laura and adam soon after she joined the university of stirling as a parttime lecturer in social work and once again joined us in another large study of violence a research evaluation of the first programmes for domestic violence abusers in the uk which had been established in scotland she became the senior research fellow in charge of the overall management of the evaluation from this work we jointly authored with ruth lewis changing violent men in addition to studying the harm done by violence we decided that it would also be important to study the benefits that might be realised if it was eliminated from a relationship as we began to develop a scale to measure quality of life kate suggested that we assess whether programme participation resulted in the couple concerned being more likely to have a laugh together this was typical of kate she struck upon something that proved to be one of the best indicators of positive change in a relationship that had been scarred by violence from this study she wrote her phd thesis do you live here too a study of the intimate relationships of violent men and the women they abuse in kate joined the university of glasgow where she remained for years first as a lecturer and then as a senior lecturer in social work before returning to stirling in as a senior lecturer in social work while she was at glasgow we undertook the third large study of violence in which we worked together as a team murder in britain involved the examination of more than cases of men and women convicted of murder as well as indepth interviews with men and women serving life in prison kate was the principal author of the resulting publications on the killing of children and most recently published two very important articles men who murder children inside and outside the family in the british journal of social work and the murder of children by fathers in the context of child abuse in child abuse and neglect her efforts to raise public awareness change public policy and practice and introduce innovations for abused women and their children and for victims of rape were tireless she never stopped even after the diagnosis of her illness and throughout the numerous treatments that reduced her strength for those who knew and loved her she will also be remembered as someone who had the human touch who worked to change things for the better and who had the unfailing ability to

megan basham seems surprisingly shy for the latest controversial american author to have charged on to the public battlefield between mothers who stay at home and those who work ordering an iced tea in a new york restaurant the yearold conservative commentator appears to be cut from a different cloth to the ever angrier voices on both sides of what the american media refers to as the mommy wars her new book beside every successful man a womans guide to having it all reads like a cheery pep talk for women alienated by the increasingly polarised debate in the book basham sets out a strategy for women who want to stay at home but cant afford to most research says of women want to work fewer hours when their kids are young she says how can you ignore that and tell them theyre wrong or naive she argues that women can opt out of the ninetofive by focusing on helping their husbands be more successful in their careers and find fulfilment by doing so and as a happy sideeffect she says these more traditional marriages are less likely to end in divorce she cites herself and a series of highprofile couples as examples and backs her argument up with statistics such as men whose wives arent employed earn on average more than single men but for men whose wives have fulltime jobs that number drops to critics have denounced the book as irresponsible delusional immoral and misleading but basham insists she didnt expect such reactions it wasnt originally meant to be political she says but at the time there were books coming out saying that women must work fulltime that its not fair to the sisterhood to take any time out i just didnt feel they were realistic id noticed how many successful men would say i wouldnt be here without my wife and i was curious i wanted to know what these women were doing i wanted to emulate them in fact she already had the book tells the story of how she helped her husband brian now a tv weatherman work out what he wanted to do with his life but more than just acting as cheerleader she rewrote his cv researched jobs wrote letters and found him an agent and when he landed his first job in the business she quit fulltime work as a journalist and university curriculums editor went freelance and moved from arizona to texas they now live in tucson where he works on breakfast television after a long time trying for kids she is five months pregnant and looking forward to finally scaling back her work in the summer women are collaborators she says we have a more communal concept of success and a lot of that applies to our relationships look at michelle and barack obama people forget she introduced him to the political scene in chicago her main critic is the formidable leslie bennetts a vanity fair contributor and author of the feminine mistake an urgent warning to women that if they step out of the workforce for as little as three years they will permanently damage their earning potential when the pair appeared on a television show together sparks flew after the cameras went off she turned and screamed at me basham recalls she must have misunderstood me because i didnt say all women should be at home barefoot and pregnant im talking about women pursuing their dreams i was shocked that she would brook no alternative that there is such a violent reaction to suggesting other options for her part bennetts accuses basham of misrepresenting facts and it is true that basham knows how to spin her statistics take what she refers to as the male marriage premium which states that when a man gets married his earnings increase by between and while women often experience the opposite a marriage penalty while this kind of inequality enrages her opponents basham argues that if wives encourage their husbands to earn more the extra household income enables women to take a pay cut bashams approval of the traditional family is clearly influenced by her own experience the daughter of an unwed teenage mother she grew up to be she says pretty prolife her parents reunited and married when she was five before having two more children after all her offspring had left home her mother became an interior designer and basham holds her up as an inspiring example of a stayathome mother going on to have success bashams book has arrived at a point when the mommy wars debate is more polarised than ever one month after her row with bennetts a section of the american religious right launched their true women manifesto calling for a counterrevolution to the advances of feminism it asserts that men and women are designed to reflect god in complementary and distinct ways essentially arguing that women belong in the home men in the workforce and that women can be liberated through submission its an extension of a biblical concept known as complementarianism one that basham doesnt entirely reject you can see that biologically there are differences between the way our brains are wired and some of the things we prioritise might be different she says the problem is that i know couples who are the opposite so you cant say all women are complementary to their husbands at the same time i think the negative thing is pretending that women are men setting up a paradigm by mens rules assuming that only success in business is achievement does she receive hate mail yes she says with a dismissive laugh ive had a lot of emails from college students who are clearly in the midst of their womens studies saying i must be uneducated i took feminist studies like everyone else she describes herself as a choice feminist and in the book writes that though the feminist movement was essential in many respects certain factions of it have led to a place where women are encouraged to treat their husbands as rivals and their homes as battlegrounds over whether everyone is doing the same amount of the dishes and earning indeed in the basham household she does more housework but he gets up at am my schedules not as tough i think its a bit silly to insist that the division of labour be because well whose version are we talking about most men have a higher tolerance for messiness than women so they think the labour is being evenly divided its so funny because when you show any love or support well youre letting down the sisterhood really im not,2009-02,megan basham seems surprisingly shy latest

its queer how out of touch with truth women are they live in a world of their own and there has never been anything like it and never can be it is too beautiful altogether and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over these are the words of joseph conran a man desperately dated even for his time they are years and a whole world apart from the current feeling espoused by many journalists that the blame for all of our current woes can be laid firmly at the feet of men are both of these theories ridiculous generalisations are neither of them gunther grass claimed that bystanding or doing nothing was as bad as committing the act in itself admittedly he was talking about the nazi holocaust but my question to ruth sunderland et al remains where the hell have you been the horse called from jamaica to let you know that he bolted a few weeks ago sold the stable and isnt returning until his bonus is paid further to this your culpability in buying handbags and face cream doesnt exactly promote your aptitude for budgetary or prioritisation responsibilities i have always tried to keep clear of mass generalisations fearing they would lump me into the same pigeonhole as the author of the above quote but it seems to be the only viable way to counteract the accusations that we wouldnt be in this mess if women were involved to that end i would like to apologise to the ambitious cutthroat risktaking or dare i say bonuspaid women who will remain anomalies for the purposes of the current debate over who exactly are the crafty criminals in the crippling credit crunch crisis sunderland is quite right to emphasise the role women should be playing in finance but somehow she manages to quote statistics proving womens resilience to the downturn in one article while claiming them to be the real victims of the credit crunch in another it seems that womens economic gains over the last few decades relative to men will be harder hit i guess relegating them back to secondclass citizen status so i suppose that while were assigning blame to the financiers and politicians for ruining the progress women have made we should probably give them a pat on the back for overseeing such genderequalising financial independence and equality at work if you want to vilify men for the recessiondepressionarmageddon good for you i expect it to follow your awarding of longoverdue honours for their overwhelming exponential successes up to that point the legion of jobs and wealth that the city has created outside of its own doors is unparalleled and that quality of lifepossessions is something most people are unwilling to relinquish if on the other hand however you want to move forward and you have some ideas on how to fix the problem im all ears my suggestion is to outlaw otc trading a closeddoor interbank process

the government today unveiled a m funding package for domestic violence charities the cash will be spent on renewing support for charities awarenessraising leaflets and initiatives to ensure victims do not return to abusive relationships new measures include fasttracked benefits services for domestic violence victims and regular visits to refuges and sure start centres by benefits staff saving women the trauma of waiting at social security offices a new scheme is also planned in collaboration with the banking sector to help women who feel trapped in abusive relationships because they do not have control over their own finances the home secretary jacqui smith said i know from talking to domestic violence professionals that money worries may exacerbate domestic tensions and that one of the reasons why many women remain in abusive situations is concerns about financial independence i do not want any woman to feel trapped the government has been working with banks to make it easier for abused women to set up accounts if they have fled a violent home leaving identification documents behind smith said i hope that new information about how the banks can support victims even if its just by offering to discuss personal and sensitive financial matters privately or accepting nontraditional forms of id to open a new account will enable more women to feel they can take their first step towards breaking away from their abusers paul ross director of the british bankers association said the banking industry is committed to providing help to victims of domestic abuse urgently in need of access to banking the funding announcement comes as donations dry up because of the credit crunch sandra horley chief executive of refuge said the charity has already had to cut back on staff there are still massive holes in domestic violence service provision and other government departments need to allocate funding to plug these gaps she said the reality is that refuge like many other providers is struggling to survive in an impoverished sector the government allocation came under fire from some charities which feel it does not reflect the diversity of groups affected by domestic violence broken rainbow which serves lesbians gay men transgender and bisexual victims of domestic violence pointed to what may be seen as a bias in the scheme which allows abused individuals to open independent bank accounts with a letter from a refuge manager confirming their circumstances as opposed to the usual multiple proofs of identification which may be in the possession the abuser a spokesperson said it is problematic for lgbt people as there are no lgbt refuges in the uk as such this new initiative while a step in the right direction falls short for the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender communities the charity which receives funding from the home office for its helpline for male victims of domestic violence called for greater inclusivity in smiths statements the spokesperson added domestic violence is not a gender issue but a human issue and as such its time to address the lgbt community where the problem remains invisible organisations serving ethnic minority women said the funding will not address the crisis they face the drive to integrate them within generic serviceproviders has threatened their existence in recent years according to a spokeswoman for southall black sisters who pointed out that just one in local authorities out of provide services for ethnic minority women she added local authorities are diverting funds so small

french rapper orelsan was forced to explain himself this week as outrage over his song sale pute dirty slut hit the headlines sale pute is an immediately recognisable type women are described only as bitches or hos violence is a valid response to infidelity and most importantly there is an imperative not to take the lyrics seriously orelsans halfhearted apology im sorry if my song shocked to french journalists was combined with an explanation that those lyrics were meant to be understood as coming from one of orelsans characters an invented misogynist not a real one im not a misogynist orelsan protested ive never hit a woman it seems there are several things going on here first the assumption that it is a minority who would have been shocked by lyrics such as you are only a sow who deserves her place at the slaughterhouse well see how you suck cock after i box your jaw and i want you to get pregnant and lose the baby second that if something is said while in character this absolves the creator of any responsibility for the words third that hitting women is the benchmark of misogyny words alone fall short of the standard though we may take the fact that the outrage over sale pute is happening late two years after its release as evidence that feminists werent paying close enough attention at the time orelsans surprise at the reaction to the song is somewhat unfounded over the past decade both rap and hiphop have raised concerns about misogynistic homophobic and violent lyrics and demeaning videos anyone looking for a welcome antidote to these would do well to check out sarah joness parody of sexist hiphop your revolution ironically joness recording of the song was banned by the fcc on grounds of obscenity while the original songs were for the most part played without even edits it is no surprise that orelsan is being compared to the king of these debates the man george bush once referred to as the most dangerous threat to american children since polio eminem in eminems songs kim and bonnie and clyde he fantasises about killing his estranged wife kim in front of their daughter hailie in kill you the narrator threatens slut you think i wont choke no whore til the vocal chords dont work in her throat no more in the final three seconds of the song he laughs and says im just playing ladies you know i love you as if to suggest that the whole song has been ironic the just a joke defence has long been used to excuse sexist racist or homophobic outbursts orelsans defence of being in character is also one we have seen before plan bs album contains songs told from the perspective of murderers rapists and other violent characters citing films such as irreversible and baisemoi in his lyrics to sick to def plan b argues that he should be treated in the same way as those films directors and writers as a storyteller and narrator of disturbing events not as a confessing criminal the point is an obvious one talking is not the same as doing and of course we can no more extrapolate a confession of rape and murder from a song by a rapper than we can conclude that all country artists have seen their dogs shot had their partners cheat on them and finally become alcoholics the hypocrisy in the discussions is rarely raised outrage about violence and misogyny in music is almost always confined to rap and hiphop despite there being much to engage with elsewhere for example nick caves fascination with murdered women which spans his whole career is seen as artistic expression i shot the sheriff is seen as a bit of fun but cop killer sparked national outrage in the us the stranglers song sometimes which opens with someday im gonna smack your face and contains the promise to beat you honey till you drop did nothing to detract from their status as a cult band and the rolling stones song brown sugar despite being a narrative of a slave owners pleasure at raping and beating his black female slave is still seen as something of a national treasure used by x factor contestants and soft drink advertisers alike surely we should object either to none of it or to all of it,2009-03,french rapper orelsan wa forced

radical reforms to maternity leave legislation which would allow fathers to take more paid time off will be proposed today by the equalities and human rights commission concerned that the extension of maternity leave from six to nine and soon to months has entrenched the assumption that women do the caring and pay the career penalty the ehrc will set out a series of measures to redress the gender imbalance by encouraging fathers to become more involved in caring for their children new parental rights introduced over the past decade are well intentioned but entrench the current unequal division of labour and caring between the sexes and work against gender equality the ehrcs working better report says research conducted by the commission suggests that families no longer have firm preconceptions about men as breadwinners and women as carers but notes that legislation is lagging behind this shift britain now stands out internationally for having a very long period of leave reserved for mothers most of it at a low rate of pay and for having a relatively weak parental leave the report says together long lowpaid maternity leave and short lowpaid paternity leave convey the message that it is primarily women who are responsible for the care of young children research shows that the gender pay gap which on average sees men being paid pence in every pound more than women more than trebles when women reach their s as a result of the career compromises which come with motherhood concluding that it was time that policymaking enabled men to play an equal part in parenting the ehrc proposes that the first weeks of a babys life would remain dedicated maternity leave for mothers but with higher rates of pay so that they would receive of pay for the entirety of their maternity leave fathers would still get two weeks of paternity leave at the birth of their child but this would also go up to of their pay beyond the first six months of maternity leave the commission proposes three blocks of parental leave which could be taken any time before the childs fifth birthday each of about four months one block dedicated to mothers one to fathers and one either could take the first eight weeks of each of these blocks of leave would be paid at under the scheme parents would not usually be able to take leave simultaneously to encourage more fathers to take responsibility for caring for children we are keen that some part of the leave entitlement for fathers is taken alone without the mother on leave the report says their research showed that families with an annual income of less than were much less likely to take leave than families with a higher income similarly single mothers were far more likely to take a very short maternity leave the proposed increase in paid leave would help lowincome parents to take longer time off after the birth the ehrc said alarm about the unintended negative consequences of enhanced maternity leave arrangements intensified last year when the entrepreneur sir alan sugar said he would be less likely to hire a woman of childbearing age explaining that the law was counterproductive he said if someone comes into an interview and you think to yourself there is a possibility that this woman might have a child and therefore take time off it is a bit of a psychological negative thought the changes suggested by the ehrc would redress the balance in this area the report calls for more attention to be paid to the desires of frustrated fathers keen but unable to spend more time caring for their children the ehrc has calculated that the scheme would cost bn and proposes it be introduced gradually over years a department for business spokesman said these are difficult times for businesses and families and the ehrcs proposals look to have considerable costs attached to them we will need to take time to more fully assess the implications the management of the ehrc was under pressure this weekend after a number of resignations but senior figures will gather in london today to launch the report we are proposing one of the most radical changes in our approach to parental leave in a decade chief executive nicola brewer will say changing times what the father says eleven days after his son noah was born daniel soar cannot imagine tearing himself away to go back to work the editor considers himself lucky his employer is giving him four weeks paternity leave on full pay compared with the fortnight on a week that is the statutory allowance but the thought of returning to the office for good once his month is up still troubles him i think it will be quite traumatic were still settling noahs had to go back to hospital for a couple of days and these kind of complications are very ordinary if you spend your first two weeks in and out of hospital its a bit depressing he welcomes the idea of being able to take parental leave after six months allowing his wife eleanor a publisher to go back to work it would be great if we had that choice i imagine it would be very likely that wed do that i can imagine wanting to spend time with him and i think from ellies point of view it would make sense for her not to have too long out of the office she is getting full pay for the first three months half pay for the second three and then statutory pay were prepared to be very belttightening in the second three months so any improvement in maternity pay could only be a good thing seeing male friends who work on a more flexible freelance basis has shown daniel the benefits of being able to share a babys first months you want your child to have as much time with both parents as possible he says but at this stage its a selfish thing id just like to spend all the time i can with him,2009-03,radical

homicide reviews should finally become law this year five years after they were first put before parliament as part of the domestic violence crime and victims act ofsted reported last year that the not dissimilar system of serious case reviews is not working properly the new homicide reviews should enable family and friends of the deceased to become involved and thereby give police and other agencies an insight into how to handle victims of domestic violence better of course these enquiries should be about learning lessons but that phrase grates unless things have really changed as a result one way of doing this would be to compel public bodies to appear in public to describe how their practices have changed and to publish those changes online but here are some of the things that need urgent improvement first coroners and gps need training in domestic abuse awareness coroners in particular must keep abreast of the latest findings their powers have been increased and they have a duty to be better informed about the forms domestic abuse can take i hope the coroners and justice bill currently going through parliament reflects this and my mp has sought an assurance from the justice secretary jack straw that it will i am repeatedly told that many gps are not taking advantage of opportunities to spot domestic abuse they too need to be aware of the risk factors that indicate an individual may be at high risk indeed all health professionals need to see domestic violence as part of the remit of their work where routine enquiry exists it is very striking how many victims are identified but the practice is not widespread every year hundreds of individuals with insecure immigration status face domestic violence in the uk but they have no recourse to public funding a ruling allows such people to remain in the uk indefinitely but as it currently stands their ineligibility for benefits puts extraordinary pressure on them multi agency risk assessment conferences maracs should be put on a statutory footing and forge stronger links with child protection agencies and an independent domestic violence advocate should always be working alongside maracs save lives but currently only take place through goodwill and victims of domestic violence need a safe place perhaps at their workplace or an internet cafe where they can record details of the abuse they are suffering as it can be dangerous for them to keep a journal at home unfortunately some individuals are so controlled by their persecutor that they cannot leave the house to spend time at an internet cafe but for those who can the record can help enormously during a court case and stop the experience beginning to seem routine and normal by introducing maracs independent domestic violence advocates and specialist courts this government has done more than any other to address domestic violence the maracs and specialist courts are available to both men and women and some of the advocates too its consultation on violence against women and girls including a bus that will be travelling to towns is very welcome but i am also told that domestic violence services are in a dire financial state they need to be properly funded now and for that funding to be sustained it seems particularly wasteful that the argument for funding has to be won times the number of local strategic partnerships when the governments own data shows that domestic abuse is unrelated to location making savings on all those duplicated meetings would be a very small but worthwhile start as a member of the governments victims advisory panel i recently met the newly appointed victims champion sara payne to make these points and i hope the government will heed them frank mullane is the coordinator of the charity advocacy after fatal domestic abuse and a member of the governments victims advisory panel this article represents his own views and not those of the panel,2009-03,homicide review finally

the charity grandparents plus has called on the government to change the rules to give more recognition to grandparents who help out with childcare it is asking for two weeks granny leave in a grandchilds first year and an extension of flexible working practices to cover grandparents as well as parents my childrens grandma will be at our house right now having dressed and fed my two underfours and dropped off my little boy at preschool she makes the minute journey to our house every wednesday to arrive at am shes a retired nurse she says the early morning doesnt bother her in time for us to catch our train on the days i work childcare is shared between a nursery and my mum she is retired now so she hasnt had to battle with an employer to get the time to help us out we make sure shes never out of pocket but clearly her support once a week helps us out financially in a huge way and shes flexible if we have commitments after work she can sometimes hang around a bit if i need to work an extra day she can often help out but theres much more to it for my children wednesday is a grandma day she makes things with them plays with the train set reads endless stories and she takes them to the bakery for cakes after preschool they love it and she does too i think statutory leave for grandparents is a great idea my mum was still working when our first baby was born so she had to use up holiday when she came to see her grandson and help out with nappies and it seems unfair that families who decide to pay grandparents for their time can only claim the childcare element of tax credits if the grandparent goes through the process of becoming a registered childminder so should the government be giving grandparents more financial help should those looking after grandchildren get tax breaks or statutory leave should parents who pay grandparents get the same tax credits they would if they employed a childminder,2009-03,charity grandparent plus ha called government change rule give recognition grandparent help childcare asking two week granny leave grandchild first year extension flexible working practice cover grandparent well parent childrens grandma house right dressed fed two underfours dropped little boy preschool make minute journey house every wednesday arrive shes retired nurse say early morning doesnt bother time u catch train day work childcare shared nursery mum retired hasnt battle employer get time help u make sure shes never pocket clearly support week help u financially huge way shes flexible commitment work sometimes hang around bit need work extra day often help much child wednesday grandma day make thing play train set read endless story take bakery cake preschool love doe think statutory leave grandparent great idea mum wa still working first baby wa born use holiday came see grandson help nappy seems unfair family decide pay grandparent time claim childcare element tax credit grandparent go process becoming registered childminder government giving grandparent financial help looking grandchild get tax break statutory leave parent pay grandparent get tax credit would employed childminder,"['charity', 'grandparent', 'plus', 'ha', 'called', 'government', 'change', 'rule', 'give', 'recognition', 'grandparent', 'help', 'childcare', 'asking', 'two', 'week', 'granny', 'leave', 'grandchild', 'first', 'year', 'extension', 'flexible', 'working', 'practice', 'cover', 'grandparent', 'well', 'parent', 'childrens', 'grandma', 'house', 'right', 'dressed', 'fed', 'two', 'underfours', 'dropped', 'little', 'boy', 'preschool', 'make', 'minute', 'journey', 'house', 'every', 'wednesday', 'arrive', 'shes', 'retired', 'nurse', 'say', 'early', 'morning', 'doesnt', 'bother', 'time', 'u', 'catch', 'train', 'day', 'work', 'childcare', 'shared', 'nursery', 'mum', 'retired', 'hasnt', 'battle', 'employer', 'get', 'time', 'help', 'u', 'make', 'sure', 'shes', 'never', 'pocket', 'clearly', 'support', 'week', 'help', 'u', 'financially', 'huge', 'way', 'shes', 'flexible', 'commitment', 'work', 'sometimes', 'hang', 'around', 'bit', 'need', 'work', 'extra', 'day', 'often', 'help', 'much', 'child', 'wednesday', 'grandma', 'day', 'make', 'thing', 'play', 'train', 'set', 'read', 'endless', 'story', 'take', 'bakery', 'cake', 'preschool', 'love', 'doe', 'think', 'statutory', 'leave', 'grandparent', 'great', 'idea', 'mum', 'wa', 'still', 'working', 'first', 'baby', 'wa', 'born', 'use', 'holiday', 'came', 'see', 'grandson', 'help', 'nappy', 'seems', 'unfair', 'family', 'decide', 'pay', 'grandparent', 'time', 'claim', 'childcare', 'element', 'tax', 'credit', 'grandparent', 'go', 'process', 'becoming', 'registered', 'childminder', 'government', 'giving', 'grandparent', 'financial', 'help', 'looking', 'grandchild', 'get', 'tax', 'break', 'statutory', 'leave', 'parent', 'pay', 'grandparent', 'get', 'tax', 'credit', 'would', 'employed', 'childminder']",186
ive got an interview but have now found out that im pregnant q i am a hardworking selfemployed professional and married woman in my s i have an interview with a large nationwide organisation employing a huge number of women and with a supposedly familyfriendly outlook i have requested parttime hours or a jobshare and the organisation is aware i have a young child i recently found out i am pregnant i was not when i submitted the application form i had very short maternity leave for my last pregnancy and would hope to take a similar period of time off with this one before returning to forge a longterm career within this organisation i feel i should inform the interview panel of my position prior to interview but my husband and friends say i should mention nothing unless i am offered a job i strongly feel this would be dishonest i am reluctant to accept a job offer only to drop this bombshell early in my employment as i would be fearful of losing the respect of my team and senior managers my options appear to be a not mention it unless i am offered a job and then mention it either immediately upon accepting the job or soon after my employment b to write a letter prior to interview so they have the information in good time or c mention it at the interview i dont know which is best i would love to work for this organisation have a lot of relevant experience and feel i would be an asset i am reluctant to give them a reason to have future doubts about employing women of my age who they suspect might leave quickly to have children i have always been uncomfortable with women who join organisations just to get the maternity benefits or who take generous maternity benefits from small companies with the plan of going back to work for a few months to keep the benefits before leaving i try to be as honest as possible but see many other women taking advantage of the system and giving the rest of us a bad name am i being stupid for trying to act honestly even though the law would allow me to mislead my employer all i want is a good job which i can fit in with raising my children but i feel that as soon as i reveal my pregnancy they will look for a reason not to employ me a i tried quite hard to edit your letter still further but found it impossible youve given all aspects of your predicament admirably thorough and dispassionate thought and they all deserve inclusion still im sure you should follow your initial instinct you deeply dislike the idea of dishonesty and hate the thought of devious action on your part damaging the credibility of other women after you to me even if absolute and immediate openness might work against you thats the route you have to take this company is large and employs many women it seems open to flexible working and it will have experienced just about every ruse that people in your position may be tempted to employ i suspect that the people there will have learned to appreciate honesty so i think you should go for option b and write immediately start with the truth that at the time of application you didnt know you were pregnant stress your respect for their organisation with specific reasons if possible and your ambition to make a longterm career with them remind them of your qualifications and why you believe you could be an asset and close by expressing the heartfelt hope that the news of your pregnancy though clearly an inconvenience for them wont in any way influence their decision as to whether or not youre a suitable career candidate as a ps you might want to add the point about the short length of the maternity leave you took after your last pregnancy you may of course not be offered this job and youll never be certain why but deliberate deception on your part wont guarantee it either leadership is not my strong point how can i transform myself q my company runs a prestigious internal graduate training scheme for its future managers i meet all the requirements comfortably except one leadership i havent got the first idea how to lead or motivate people can this be learned a ive always been a bit wary of the phrase born leader i suppose theres something in it but it suggests there are lots of other people who are born followers and that i dont believe i suspect your own greatest handicap is one of your most endearing features the kind of selfdoubt that intelligent people often entertain by contrast one of the most evident characteristics of those who believe themselves to be born leaders is an almost reckless confidence these are leaders who can all too easily lead their more thoughtful but diffident followers into the valley of the shadow of death so browse among the thousands of pieces of advice you can readily find in books and online the training scheme should give you an opportunity to try things out bit by bit youll need to exhibit rather more confidence than you feel but thats not cheating thats what all the best leaders have to do

two recent news stories the announcement of an ipcc investigation into the death of katie summers murdered by her exboyfriend last october and the conviction of serial rapist john worboys who was previously arrested by police then freed to attack women again and again and again underline in the bleakest of ways how far our public services have to go in the fight against violence against women meanwhile a substantial section of the population continues to believe that a woman is somehow culpable if she is assaulted whether by a partner or a stranger there have been calls for a stephen lawrencestyle public inquiry following the summers and worboys cases but what we really need is a massive public education drive along the lines of those relating to drinkdriving and hivaids to bring about the kind of cultural shift necessary to end the silencing and mythmaking that persists around violence against women its a campaign that needs to be funded and backed by the government rather than the voluntary sector to make it truly meaningful of course resources are limited but given that domestic violence alone costs the taxpaper m a year roughly the same as the defence budget it would be costeffective for the government to invest in an infrastructure of services but that infrastructure must apply across the country too many women now are losing out because provision varies wildly from one local authority or police force to another victims deserve a set of national standards sending a message that whether you live in penzance or penrith sexual and domestic violence will not be tolerated and will be dealt with effectively,2009-03,two recent news story announcement ipcc investigation death katie summer murdered exboyfriend last october conviction serial rapist john worboys wa previously arrested police freed attack woman underline bleakest way far public service go fight violence woman meanwhile substantial section population continues believe woman somehow culpable assaulted whether partner stranger call stephen lawrencestyle public inquiry following summer worboys case really need massive public education drive along line relating drinkdriving hivaids bring kind cultural shift necessary end silencing mythmaking persists around violence woman campaign need funded backed government rather voluntary sector make truly meaningful course resource limited given domestic violence alone cost taxpaper year roughly defence budget would costeffective government invest infrastructure service infrastructure must apply across country many woman losing provision varies wildly one local authority police force another victim deserve set national standard sending message whether live penzance penrith sexual domestic violence tolerated dealt effectively,"['two', 'recent', 'news', 'story', 'announcement', 'ipcc', 'investigation', 'death', 'katie', 'summer', 'murdered', 'exboyfriend', 'last', 'october', 'conviction', 'serial', 'rapist', 'john', 'worboys', 'wa', 'previously', 'arrested', 'police', 'freed', 'attack', 'woman', 'underline', 'bleakest', 'way', 'far', 'public', 'service', 'go', 'fight', 'violence', 'woman', 'meanwhile', 'substantial', 'section', 'population', 'continues', 'believe', 'woman', 'somehow', 'culpable', 'assaulted', 'whether', 'partner', 'stranger', 'call', 'stephen', 'lawrencestyle', 'public', 'inquiry', 'following', 'summer', 'worboys', 'case', 'really', 'need', 'massive', 'public', 'education', 'drive', 'along', 'line', 'relating', 'drinkdriving', 'hivaids', 'bring', 'kind', 'cultural', 'shift', 'necessary', 'end', 'silencing', 'mythmaking', 'persists', 'around', 'violence', 'woman', 'campaign', 'need', 'funded', 'backed', 'government', 'rather', 'voluntary', 'sector', 'make', 'truly', 'meaningful', 'course', 'resource', 'limited', 'given', 'domestic', 'violence', 'alone', 'cost', 'taxpaper', 'year', 'roughly', 'defence', 'budget', 'would', 'costeffective', 'government', 'invest', 'infrastructure', 'service', 'infrastructure', 'must', 'apply', 'across', 'country', 'many', 'woman', 'losing', 'provision', 'varies', 'wildly', 'one', 'local', 'authority', 'police', 'force', 'another', 'victim', 'deserve', 'set', 'national', 'standard', 'sending', 'message', 'whether', 'live', 'penzance', 'penrith', 'sexual', 'domestic', 'violence', 'tolerated', 'dealt', 'effectively']",201
whether it is burglary firearms or knife crime it seems there is no issue that the government does not think can be solved by a summit of course the primary purpose is generally to allow them to show that they are doing something without actually taking any action but there is always a danger that somebody might miss the point and use the occasion to say what they really think about what the government is doing so it was this week with jacqui smiths summit on violence against women at which sandra horley the respected chief executive of refuge failed to stick to the script and instead rightly criticised the home secretary for resorting to gimmicks this weeks summit launched the governments longawaited consultation on a violence against women strategy i have for some time been calling on the government to address the fact that there still is not a coherent crossgovernment strategy on tackling violence against women the logic behind such an approach is clear violence against women whether through domestic violence rape stalking or another form is not simply an issue for the criminal justice system but touches on a wide range of policy areas so instead of yet more piecemeal initiatives we need a fully thoughtthrough strategy that focuses as much on preventing violence as it does on responding to it and supporting its victims last year the conservative party presented its vision for ending violence against women in a wellreceived policy paper our view is that we must work with schools police healthcare professionals and the voluntary sector on preventative measures that can stop violence occurring in the first place that means for instance ensuring that police officers receive appropriate training in dealing with the different forms of violence that women experience it means that we need more health visitors to support women who have just given birth the time at which the risk of domestic violence can be greatest and it means helping schools develop lesson plans on these issues so that they can for example teach not just about sex but about relationships and the meaning of consent none of these measures will stop violence by themselves but we must be clear that together we can work towards ending violence where women have been the victims of violence we must back the vital services that do so much to help them sandra horley is an impressive advocate for the work of womens refuges they do important work that is why i am concerned by aspects of the recent changes to the arrangements by which lone parents claim benefits although these reforms were broadly welcome they have a potentially negative effect on the women that rely on benefits to fund their stay in a refuge under the new arrangements women with a youngest child aged seven or over will in time be required to look for a job in order to receive certain benefits asking a woman who has just fled a violent relationship to go out and get a job straight away is simply not appropriate we should not be putting them under pressure to return to work immediately conservatives are proposing a threemonth grace period during which time women who are housed in refuges following domestic violence will not be required to seek work in order to qualify for benefits this will be an important step in supporting the work of refuges and ensuring that survivors of abuse have the protection that they need there is also more we can do to support another vital service rape crisis centres due to funding uncertainties there are now only centres affiliated to the rape crisis network down from in the government has been dangerously complacent on this and only this week harriet harman rejected conservative plans to offer stable threeyear funding for centres and to set aside m from the victim surcharge towards the creation of up to new centres so i understand the frustration that many practitioners have over the governments announcements this week after years in office and despite some steps forward not enough has been done to ensure violence against women is tackled effectively and with an appropriate emphasis on prevention as they launch their threemonth consultation they are fast running out of time to implement the measures that are needed if they do not act in time then the conservatives are ready to take

joan smith is right to call jacqui smiths plan for a database of violent male partners a headlinegrabbing gimmick the proposal has inevitably caught the medias attention but reading through the home offices consultation document on violence against women it is not all that leaped out at me remember tough on crime tough on the causes of crime well i went through all pages of the document looking for any discussion of the causes that might lead some people to be violent towards their partners the closest i got was one section asking how do social attitudes towards girls and women affect the problem of violence against women within that section only one question raises a possible causal link between social factors and violent behaviour specifically is there a link between sexualised images perceptions and actual violence the answer to that question of course is that it depends who you ask it seems unlikely that after a week consultation the home office will be able to answer a question that has divided the worlds best social scientists for half a century or more although on past form i doubt that will stop them beyond this one loaded question there is absolutely no attempt to investigate the actual causes of violence against women or for the less deterministically minded what factors lead some people to behave in such a way this is absurd it is like launching a consultation into how we can reduce the incidence of cancer without considering what causes the disease the reason the home office doesnt consider it necessary to ask about the causes of intimate partner violence is we must presume because they think they already know violence against women occurs because it is an expression of patriarchal power relations men beat women to keep them in their place to control them and entrench male privilege that has been the ideological standpoint of most domestic violence and rape prevention charities for years and appears to have been accepted unquestioningly by the current government as ive argued before this explanatory framework is demonstrably false if it were true we would see little or no equivalent violence by women against men or in samesex relationships in reality dozens of research projects have shown that such incidents are relatively commonplace if violence against women is not explained by patriarchal social pressures what might explain it while we will never know exactly why one individual chooses to throw a punch or pick up a knife there is a large body of criminological and psychological research that has picked out factors that increase the probability that someone will become violently abusive in adulthood there are disputes about their relative importance but key elements undoubtedly include physical and emotional neglect or abuse in childhood according to straus et al a child who grows up in a family where the adults are violent to each other is almost three times as likely to display violent behaviour as others another study found that a child subjected to physical abuse who also witnesses domestic violence is between five and nine times as likely to become an abusive adult there is also a compelling suggestion put forward by lonnie athens that violent adults are in many cases taught to be violent as children not just by imitation and social learning but by their carers actively instructing them to respond to perceived insult challenge or obstruction with their fists in isolation any one of these factors will increase the possibility that an individual will develop violent behaviour towards others especially their intimate partners in combination they make up a robust if inexact recipe for a violent abuser this knowledge should be enough to make us question the whole narrative of the home office consultation violence against women does not happen on a sociological island but within a complex web of conflict and interpersonal abuse violence against women cannot be rigidly separated from violence against men and especially violence against children it is all part of the same selfperpetuating machine there is one social factor that i certainly do not dispute violence of any kind is much more likely within families that tolerate or even encourage it and within societies or cultures that do the same with that in mind there should be no objections to society sending the strongest possible messages through education awareness campaigns and where necessary the judicial system to say that domestic violence is never acceptable by anyone towards anyone much more can be done on this front not least more public recognition of the extent and harmfulness of violence against men ill make a humble personal submission to the home office consultation myself i will suggest that to reduce violence against women we need to find ways to break the cycles of abuse that might mean quality parenting classes and better education it would require effective and wellfunded social services it would certainly need family conflict services that could be accessed by struggling couples to help them control and change their behaviour in addition to emergency shelter and refuge not instead such services need to be marked less by fingerpointing blame and shame and more by a mutual desire to bring peace to a household and above all ill be asking for policies and services that are driven by best evidence and best practice rather than ideology violence against women can no longer be seen as one front in a perpetual war of the sexes we are all on the same side and its time to call a truce thats what ill be telling them if you feel similarly i suggest you do the same,2009-03,joan smith right call jacqui smith plan database violent male partner

womens status in cyberspace has been at the forefront of my mind since i guestedited labours main blogging site labourlistorg for international womens day since its launch in january the site has been criticised for being a talking shop for labour lads when i first met the sites regular editor derek draper and his allmale staff to discuss potential questions for an online survey he suggested with a grin that i ask is domestic violence always wrong and then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to set me up with james purnell but to his credit draper did let go of the editors seat since then i have been helping to redress the gender imbalance by filling labourlist with sassy intelligent female voices the response was interesting moderating the comments i developed a newfound solidarity with women on the web particularly harriet harman who had to deal with a predictable cabal of sexist comments hapless hattie harriet harpie is it the time of the month to name but a few that no male minister would have to face as one lone female commentator put it yesterday its not surprising women dont bother joining the debate according to the un the average woman speaks words a day while the average man speaks just but when it comes to political conversations online women are still massively underrepresented increasingly the political blogosphere is coming to mirror the boys club that is the house of commons it wasnt supposed to be like this untainted by years of institutionalised male dominance the internet was supposed to be a liberated space for women bloggers like penny red have argued that the anonymity of the web would secure their confidence its interactive nature would prevent male dominance and its zero barriers to entry would ensure free female comment unfortunately this hasnt happened traditional maledominated institutions are reproducing their inequalities in cyberspace and women are being pushed to the political sidelines check out the fts debate online or mps websites if you dont believe me cif is a good exception to the rule but i still wonder how my posts would be received if i traded in my profile photo for one of man why does womens exclusion from the political blogosphere matter first online communities are now at the forefront of shaping political debate policy and social norms if women are excluded from these forums it will be just as hard to win measures on gender equality as if they were barred from the house of commons as cath elliot has said we owe it to those who fought for womens suffrage to make the most of the internet second its worrying because like any forum virtual spaces develop institutional cultures over time the house of commons building might be gender neutral but fill its chambers with mainly men for hundreds of years and sexism begins to looks like part of the furniture so too with cyberspace unlike parliament the internet was not made exclusively for men but mainstream political blogs are starting to become defined as such in such a context its hard to stay true to yourself online when editing labourlist i felt the need to turn up the aggression to be more cutting than i would like to be and less willing to compromise online i felt a similar pressure that thatcher may have felt in the commons the need to compensate for my femininity in a world dominated by aggressive masculinity but facing that world alongside other female bloggers gave me hope i was lucky enough to have commentators like sadie smith tweeting alongside me and blogreaders like grace fletcherhackwood questioning the maledominated blogroll while editing i saw firsthand that given a critical mass the internet can work for women as well as against them but changing the content for one day is not enough if women dont keep up a lively presence online the blokeosphere will rule ultimately the internet is what we make it this poses a challenge to mainstream political blogs who have a responsibility to make space for female voices and to women who have a duty to fill them,2009-03,womens status cyberspace ha forefront mind since guestedited labour main blogging site labourlistorg international womens day since launch

to mark international womens day losservatore romano the vaticans official newspaper has graciously commented on womens lib for us its editorial decrees that the washing machine has contributed more to the emancipation of western women than the pill or the legalisation of abortion or being able to work outside the home but it would wouldnt it abortion and pills arent allowed over there washing machines are what a bizarre world losservatore describes with its image of the superwoman smiling madeup and radiant among the appliances of her house its more than half a century ago back in that the automatic washing machine took off and women apparently went mad in the suburbs turning to drink and sex only i didnt notice my mother and her chums being radiant and smiling they may have got rid of their heavy mangles and twintubs but it was still a fairly bleak life stuck at home fiddling with these new machines and its still a bore today were still trying our best to perk up doing the housework not so long ago the daily mail discovered a new social phenomenon countless british women doing housework in the nude put in the powder close the lid and relax reads losservatores headline but it isnt that simple vatican honestly it isnt have you ever tried it i thought everyone knew that the more time these new appliances saved us the more tasks we found to fill that time but why bother even to hope that the vatican mouthpiece would see sense it nabbed its headline from the blurb for electroluxs washy talky a bilingualtalking washingmachine launched in india in an electronic maid which helps with laundry and reminds the absentminded housewife how to use the appliance if the user accidentally leaves the lid open she will say please close the lid washy talky doesnt just talk she also thinks and makes decisions she assesses the load weight and chooses the optimum programme one could always just refer to an owners manual except that according to an electrolux spokesperson women often prefer not to have to read manuals and this is the machine that the vatican feels has helped us so much with our liberation sometimes i wonder whether progress really is progress i dont like to wallow in nostalgia but in what may have been the first laundromat was opened by a gold miner and a carpenter in california their shirt machine was powered by donkeys it sounds like much more fun but they didnt have the contraceptive pill then which would have made life even more fun than the washing machine dr paul kelly headmaster of monkseaton community high school on north tyneside has suggested that teenagers be allowed to spend two more hours in bed and arrive at school at am because experiments have shown that teenagers between and have bodyclocks that make it frightfully difficult for them to get up in the morning theyre not lazy just biologically programmed to get up late what a nuisance scientific research can be for how is everyone to work round these teenagers circadian rhythms will staff have to work late and what does kelly think will happen two hours later than the old gettingup time by then the parents will have probably gone off to work theyll have to leave the house with their children still mouldering in bed and just hope and pray the lazy little toads get up at all and if they do that they remember to turn the gas off shut the front door and windows properly and dont just decide sod school lets have our friends round for an allday rave or slobin or does kelly assume that the teenagers will spring up at the appointed time and unsupervised eat their breakfast nicely wash up find and gather together their oyster card homework packed lunch and pocket money and perkily trot off to school refreshed by their pleasant liein and keen to acquire knowledge perhaps im just embittered by experience but i think most teenagers have been a pain in the bottom since their invention decades ago one can pander till the cows come home but it wont make a scrap of difference weve shelled out up to a year to keep them going cost of the average teenage lifestyle according to the office for national statistics on consoles mobiles and all the rest of the crapola that is now called basic essentials weve built them shiny new schools monkseaton is about to open a new most technically advanced m school building and our children are still the most miserable children in the world last week walking to the vet at am i mingled with a load of them on their way to school slouching and screeching along the pavement and i spotted a couple of teenage boys bringing up the rear and puffing away at a giant spliff lets hope it turned them mellow rather than psychotic for the teachers sake at least they were up functioning and on their way to school we must be grateful for small mercies but im not what happened to early nights consistent sleep schedules no caffeine no fiddling on facebook and no scary films before bed that might be an easier way to sort out the teenage zombies that kelly is so worried about this week michele saw red riding on channel nasty gruelling but riveting with brilliant acting from everyone i shouldnt have watched it at bedtime she also saw harry hill in that ghastly collar on the front of the radio times ripped the page off and destroyed it i cant take too much horror in one

women who fall in love with violent men would be warned off the relationship by police under controversial new proposals to be published by the home secretary tomorrow jacqui smith told the observer that serial perpetrators of domestic violence could be monitored in a similar way to paedophiles allowing police to identify and alert any new partners to their records in the hope of preventing future abuse wife batterers also face new conditions restricting their movements or habits such as forcing them to seek treatment for drink problems under a wideranging review of violence against women however the idea of the state interfering in adults love lives will be highly sensitive raising new questions over privacy and over whether any genuinely repentant offenders would be able to leave their pasts behind after a series of errors by the criminal records bureau where job applicants were wrongly accused of having a criminal past there will also be concerns over the potentially devastating consequences of mistaken identity smith will ask brian moore chief constable of wiltshire and the association of chief police officers spokesman on domestic violence to lead a review of how such changes could be introduced she said it would be targeting serial offenders who basically go from one relationship to another beating up the women focusing on ways to break the cycle arguably there is a duty of care if you know that this guy has already beaten up women to consider whether you should warn the next woman she said this is a sensitive area and that is why i want brian moore to look at it the proposals come on international womens day with the weekends annual protest march against violence against women given added impetus by the case of singer rhianna whose boyfriend the rnb star chris brown was last week charged with assault over an alleged attack on her in los angeles leaked photographs of rhiannas bruised face prompted outraged fans to form facebook groups supporting her and condemning violence however some of yearold browns supporters responded by accusing her of provoking the alleged attack by being too controlling while scurrilous rumours were circulated about her behaviour on gossip websites smith declined to comment on the case but said it was clear the belief persisted in some quarters that violence could sometimes be excused adding i dont think we should ever be complacent about allowing to creep back the idea that any woman in any circumstances in any relationship deserves to be in a position where their partner is being violent the crossgovernment consultation is also expected to study new ways of preventing sexual assaults including changing male attitudes to consent the youth worker camilla batmanghelidjh has warned of a shocking increase in gang rapes of young girls in inner cities with sexual violence being used to intimidate and punish girls regarded as disrespectful towards gang members there is some evidence anecdotally if not more than that about rape as part of initiation rites and about the way in which these may be linked to gang culture and certainly i think it would be worthy of consideration as part of this consultation smith said the review will look at lessons to be learned from a pilot allowing new partners of convicted paedophiles to be alerted to their criminal records to prevent children being unwittingly put at risk although treating battered women in the same way risks charges of infantilising them smith said the nature of domestic violence left many women powerless domestic violence and its repeated incidence has the impact on women of putting them in a situation where its actually very difficult for them to make choices if they were given information by the police it would be up to them how they responded she said she signalled the government may stop short of a full register in favour of tracking selected repeat offenders however chris grayling the shadow home secretary questioned whether police had the resources to monitor the relationships of serial perpetrators all of us are concerned about domestic violence but we also have to be realistic about what our police can achieve at a time when forces are cutting numbers i struggle to see how on earth the police can be expected to keep tabs on people in this way he said other measures to be considered by the review include socalled go orders requiring a man accused of domestic violence to be temporarily removed from the couples home for a short period while his partner considers pressing charges,2009-03,woman fall love violent men would warned relationship police controversial new proposal published home secretary tomorrow jacqui smith told observer serial perpetrator domestic

germaine greer offers up an impressive intellectual explanation of why she recently commented that women arent as funny as men beaten to the punchline g march her exploration of the male versus female comic psyche includes some extremely valid observations of why men are more comfortable with being funny but i would like to add a perspective based on my experience as a producer of female comedy for the last six years greer says though it may be comforting to believe that simple misogyny prevents women being given a fair go even this will not wash well this does play a part sadly as promoters continue to resist booking female comics even though a growing band of them are out there ready and willing to work if audiences are not given the opportunity to see female comics how do they know whether or not they like them moreover there has been a common perception that comedy is a hostile environment for women we are compliant in creating this image the practicalities of life on the circuit are not for the fainthearted many hours on the road and antisocial hours do not engender a traditional home life many a promising female act has given up the juggling of career marriage and motherhood even temporarily for the sake of an easier life every year produces a new crop of women standups who will take the world by storm and when the froth subsides very few names persist greer says i agree even though my mission is to provide more standup opportunities for women it is harder to sell live female comedy not helped by the promoters vicious circle of supply and demand it is not because women lack staying power there is less work for them on the circuit than men and there are fewer women working the women who do succeed are very good greers observation that men bond as they drink play and joke together and her claim that women are less competitive are not in step with todays young women just take a look at the hen parties stalking a town centre near you on a saturday night women do as much drinking playing and joking as men but they do laugh at different things which are no less valid plus women are incredibly competitive in their own way and in my experience an ambitious woman is not to be messed with with a bit of effort men can find feminine material funny and may even find out something about us that they didnt know before no im not just talking bras periods chocolate weightwatchers here after all weve been laughing at mens scatological jokes for years my everyday experience is not just rooted in the comedy circuit i run workshops and coach women from all walks of life about how to use humour for confidence and better communication greer herself uses humour very effectively on sunday we are celebrating international womens day with a charity

they are one half of the parental equation but fathers are poorly represented when it comes to support groups for single dads go along to any toddler or baby activity and the majority of carers will be mothers or female childminders all single parents have to juggle childcare with work but for many men bringing up children alone there is no network of help advice and support however fatherfocused services are gradually gaining ground and this year a new service is due to open in london which will focus solely on lone fathers fresh on the scene with registered charity status dads house wants to offer temporary accommodation for fathers and children the first of its kind in the city in london alone there are male lone parent households in addition there are fathers who are not living with their children and are classified as absent fathers according to national statistics updated in figures from show there were million single parents and million dependent children in total up to twothirds of them living in rented accommodation one in nine of the single parents is a father research suggests there are about single fathers in the uk with about dependent children living with them under the project homes for families and fathers hoff dads house plans to set up a day centre with accommodation for up to single dads and their children a typical house will provide family bedrooms and a restaurant where parents children and visitors can get three meals a day the charity is also hoping to have onsite counsellors and specialists providing advice on subjects including finance and law the dads house run by paid staff and volunteers would also function as a dropin centre where fathers could go to to get support alongside a crche the founder of the scheme is william mcgranaghan who grew up in a singleparent family and then had to bring up his own baby singlehanded after the mother left mcgranaghan found he was left to care for his son sam who is now without help so began an awkward life of mixing parttime and temporary employment with the demands of childcare all against a budding sense of alienation as a single father one job he had was as a builder it was impossible he says work like that does not allow any flexibility who wants a builder who might have to leave a job early because he has to pick up his kid from school he moved on to work in sales which allowed a bit more flexibility but made life difficult in terms of financial security mothers appear to get more support from employers or more flexibility he argues perhaps because there arent as many single dads as single mothers mcgranaghan says he believes in gender equality and has worked hard to persuade london boroughs to recognise the importance of dads house the response i have had from local authorities has been very positive dads house can provide something that local services cannot give in terms of facetoface services says mcgranaghan yes its a sales pitch but mcgranaghan who with his long hair and tall slim build has something of the rocknroller about him says the main idea is fathers will have a chance to be involved in the work and development of dads house we do not want a typical dads house to be solely run by a housing association or the local council we have to find a way of integrating our work with theirs he explains kensington and chelsea council is considering taking on the pilot project a spokesperson confirmed plans to hold meetings with dads house to discuss a partnership the borough which is a dynamic and diverse area of inner london is the second smallest local authority in the country and the most densely populated with people per sq km although average household income levels are well above the london and national averages its boundaries contain some of the most disadvantaged areas in the uk in the borough was home to about lone parent households low compared to other local authorities figures suggested children lived with their mothers and children lived with their dads north kensington has a very high percentage of births to lone parents over and about half of those were recorded by health visitors as lacking family support dr jayne osgood a sociologist of education focusing on early childhood education and care at london metropolitan university has been approached by dads house because of the work she has done within kensington and chelsea while she has not taken on an official role as researcher for the charity she has given advice looking at the needs of dads house locally and nationally it is typically the mothers who are approached by the local authority she saysbut she believes the every child matters government strategy pushed the fatherhood issue into the limelight policy has shifted with evidence that parenting support is beneficial to school attendance and general social awareness mcgranaghan believes men often find it hard to talk to someone when they are under emotional stress its a man thing he says current information and advice for single fathers is far too internetbased we want to offer a place for them to go where they can open up and be a part of something that makes them more involved he says the groups website gets between and hits and the office fields between and calls each day other plans for dads house include life coaching sessions and cookery classes mcgranaghan also wants to develop preventative action schemes to help teenagers avoid the struggle for advice he endured were working on a promotion video for teenage dads says mcgranaghan i dont want these kids to become single dads just because they ended up becoming fathers at such an early age,2009-03,one half parental equation father poorly represented come support group single dad go along toddler baby

when equity the actors union had the brilliant idea of analysing the tv schedules they studied the cast lists of every drama that went out on terrestrial channels for a week they discovered that twothirds of all fictional characters on tv are men women were markedly underrepresented and this was alarming particularly since women make up more than half the nations tv audience now a petition calling for the redress of this imbalance is doing the rounds and has garnered more than signatures and the support of leading actors such as imelda staunton and harriet walter this lack of women characters is hardly surprising though when you think about it we might all talk about highend drama such as cranford but the meat and potatoes of tv dramas are the socalled precinct shows cops and doctors spooks lawyers and vets and the fact is that women are underrepresented in these reallife professions just as they are on television there are still far fewer women in top jobs than there should be the equality and human rights commission recently reported on the snails pace of womens progress at the rate were going they calculated it will take years for women to be equally represented in parliament almost as long they say as it would take a snail to crawl the entire length of the great wall of china only of secondary head teachers are women and only of senior police officers things are better in the medical profession where half of all graduates are now women but half of those say theyll want to work parttime for some of their lives women are still scuppered by having children they end up with lower pay lower status and less time imagine if tv really did reflect womens lives imagine if clocking off had been called part time a scintillating drama about carers in nursing homes supply teachers and supermarket checkout personnel no tvs commissioning editors say that would be dreary and it would because the reality is dreary lets have some aspirational stuff they say so instead of part time we get mistresses in which just being a woman is a drama all by itself in fact being a woman in this context entails such an illadvised and disastrous sex life that theres absolutely no time left over for serious pursuits such as breaking through the glass ceiling which has anyway turned to concrete following the credit crunch but women dont really aspire to being mistresses they might watch the programme as a kind of spectator sport to see what the ladies are wearing this week and to splutter exasperatedly at the idea that a woman who has just had her first child might be getting up in the middle of the night not to feed or settle or pace but to get into a cocktail dress and go out to a bar and pick up men like that really throws any kind of light on the lives of most women in this country like that really makes any woman pause for a thought other than how bloody ridiculous mistresses by the way is written by a man and just as women are underrepresented on the screen theyre underrepresented in the screenwriting world of the oscar nominees for screenwriting best screenplay and best adapted screenplay only one was a woman well i suppose well have to fall back on gay men then sex and the city the tv show not the ghastly film was one of the most successful shows for women in recent years and deservedly so and this was a series famously run by gay men gay men who liked women it would seem here at least the women although ostensibly in pursuit of men were really in pursuit of themselves they talked like people not women and if you compare sex and the citys smart witty wayoftheworld lunch scenes with the bonding scenes in mistresses chardonnay leading to lewd sex talk leading to helpless giggles youll see what i mean then theres the business of being a woman writer and only being asked to write about women or at least about womens stuff relationships that means theres less work for women on those meatandpotato cop shows and less work for women generally the writer of mistresses richard warlow recently said that he rarely asks himself how will this woman react instead he asks himself how will this person react fair enough but women are almost never hired to write the great dramas for men but there is one ray of light mamma mia yes i know it was absurd shallow stuff although laced with an undeniable joie de vivre but it has taken such staggering sums of money globally that it may change the business of selling drama whether on tv or film for good this story about what meryl streep at called three old

grandparents who look after their grandchildren so that the parents can go out to work will be able to claim credits towards the basic state pension the move means people who choose to give up work to provide childcare for their grandchildren will no longer miss out on national insurance contributions which allow them to qualify for a full basic state pension in his speech alistair darling said increasingly grandparents play a big role in family life and in looking after their grandchildren to reflect this we will for the first time ensure these caring responsibilities for grandparents of working age will count towards their entitlement for the basic state pension under the move grandparents and other adult family members who care for members of their family aged or younger for more than hours a week will qualify for national insurance credits towards the basic state pension from the charity grandparents plus last month called for greater financial support for grandparentswho help to care for their grandchildren so their children can continue to earnchief executive sam smetherswelcomed the changewe warmly welcome the introduction of the grandparent ni credit one in three working families rely on grandparental childcare we know that working age grandmothers on low incomes are the ones who are most likely to be providing that childcare until now they have done so with the risk that they could miss out on a full basic state pension she said but this is also an important victory for the principle that the care grandparents provide does count and should be recognised we believe this has implications for other areas of government policy but toby ryland partner at chartered accountants blick rothenberg said the move did not go far enough the token gesture allowing grandparents of working age who look after their grandchildren to earn credit towards a state pension is welcome but falls far short of the immediate financial help that this important support network desperately needs he said in another move aimed at helping families on lower incomes child tax credit will increase by an extra above indexation from the chancellor said the government had been supporting families through tax credits and providing extra help for people suffering a loss of income he said more people were working shorter weeks and seeing irregular work patterns and reduced wages and that those on lower incomes would see an automatic increase to compensate for loss of income and added that families were receiving on average a week more support through tax credits according to the treasury nine out of families with children and million working people without children already qualify for tax credits the chancellor also announced help for children with disabilities in the form of additional contributions to child trust funds children with disabilities will receive an extra a year and while those with severe disabilities will receive each a year john reeve chief executive of family investments said the government should have done more we would have liked to have seen the government introduce more measures aimed directly at helping families

the amount of money women are entitled to when they take maternity leave differs enormously across europe despite the priority given to gender equality by the european union to our shame the uk has one of the lowest levels of statutory maternity pay in the eu third only to greece and luxembourg a study by mercer consulting found that a woman earning a year would be entitled to statutory maternity pay accumulated over six months of just in the uk compare this to in italy and in denmark and norway and it is clear how much better other new mothers on the continent fare in comparison to the uk however all this may be set to change as the womens committee of the european parliament of which i am a member agreed a new maternity directive this week to extend full paid maternity leave to weeks across europe more than tripling the fullpaid leave entitlement currently in the uk also under these newly agreed proposals six weeks leave will be made mandatory after childbirth and women will be protected from dismissal for a full year following their maternity leave the directive says that if a woman is dismissed in the months following the end of maternity leave it shall be assumed to have arisen on grounds of discrimination no such provision is currently made in the uk unfortunately amendments to this directive to extend paternity leave from two weeks to four weeks were not agreed by the womens committee so the minimal two weeks leave allocated to fathers remains the same the european parliament womens rights and gender equality committee has consistently called for improvements to the existing european legislation on maternity and paternity leave and i will support this directive as it continues through parliament it will be up for debate and then again be voted on and may in the final strasbourg session however as much as i believe that women need better remuneration while on maternity leave i disagree with this reports reinforcement of the separation of the gender roles why should paternity leave remain so low in comparison to maternity countries where shared parental leave is on offer such as sweden where days at of earnings is available to be shared between parents as they wish tend to have correspondingly lower gender pay gaps swedish women are paid on average less than men compared to english women who are paid less i prefer the uk equality and human rights commissions recent recommendations for a fundamental change in parental leave cutting maternity leave down to six months in exchange for an extra four months parental leave that can be taken by either parent such a measure may well reduce the aggravation that women of childbearing age sometimes face from their employers as it would mean that men would become just as capable as women of taking extended leave to start or increase their family this topic of shared parental leave is currently being discussed with the european social partners which include trade unions when the conclusions of these discussions are made public they might then be included in this maternity directive as this report is still at the very early stages it has yet to be agreed by the gender equality committee before it can be voted on by parliament on may it is open to many new changes i will certainly be pushing to make sure that increased parental leave in preference to increased maternity leave is one of them,2009-04,amount money woman entitled take maternity leave differs enormously across europe despite priority given gender equality european union shame uk ha one lowest level

charities for battered women have been threatened with the loss of their funding unless they help male victims of domestic violence under new equality laws womens aid the domestic violence charity whose patrons include the prime ministers wife sarah brown says its femaleonly services are essential to reassure battered women and children that they will be safe however some local authorities are demanding that services such as counselling and outreach be opened to both sexes fiona mactaggart the former home office minister said some refuge services had lost grants or contracts in what she said was an unintended consequence of changes in equality law there are some local authorities who interpret equalities to mean that a refuge has to provide for men not only for women said mactaggart cochair of the womens parliamentary labour party a grouping of female mps there are some stupidnesses developing in the system that nobody intended although of men say they have been physically assaulted by a partner according to the most recent british crime survey the extent to which men suffer domestic violence is disputed surveys have suggested that many allegations of being assaulted by women are made by men facing prosecution for domestic violence nicola harwin chief executive of womens aid said its branches were still allowed to exclude men from refuges but were being told when council contracts came up for tender that they must provide services such as advice and outreach to men or lose their funding decades of progress in setting up refuges were being undermined she said in some cases contracts were being given to inexperienced providers who would deal with both sexes but did not follow important safeguards to prevent violent partners continuing to harass victims there is one independent domestic violence advocacy service where they were dealing with both male and female victims sometimes in the same relationship when a man says actually she is abusing me not me abusing her obviously that has to be treated seriously by police but you shouldnt have the same person dealing with them she said that many volunteers and staff at domestic violence charities were survivors of abuse for whom it was important that the organisation was allfemale we are going to see a shrinking of provision women do appreciate being engaged in womenonly organisations when you have been disempowered and had no control of your life through domestic violence its important for a lot of women to see that this is an organisation run by women for women womens aid refers male callers to groups specialising in male victims but mens rights groups say services for them are much patchier mactaggart wants ministers to resolve the problems unwittingly created by the socalled gender equality duty which requires local authorities to ensure that services do not discriminate on grounds of sex the government equalities office said councils were being overzealous about the new duty

well done david starkey well done it worked last week while talking about henry viii you said one of the great problems has been that henry in a sense has been absorbed by his wives which is bizarre but its what you expect from feminised history the fact that so many of the writers who write about this are women and so much of their audience is a female audience you said this because you are promoting a tv series about henry viii and you thought you would wind up the feminists flush them out to write irritably in the press and plug your show and look here i am obedient as little red riding hood trotting out of the woods with my wicker basket of annoyance but april fool david starkey for i am not going to include the name of your series nor when its on nor where instead id like to take this opportunity to recommend the wire on dvd excellent anyway back to the wives how dare he i mean how dare he david starkey actually thinks and of course he doesnt think it but he is actually prepared to say that the hapless wives of henry viii have enjoyed undue historical prominence and should be scaled down thats what you expect is it starkey that is what always happens the power of female historians has resulted in a massive cultural overemphasis on the contribution of women throughout time our history books are so skewed towards the female angle that we must despatch a few of these insignificant chicks back to their rightful place bloody hell im almost too irritated to type i cant enjoy true satisfaction without poking my finger fully into david starkeys eye and standing on his foot and then weeing in his fridge do you know how many women we can name from history david starkey about six of those are the wives of henry viii one of them is his daughter elizabeth then theres marie antoinette joan of arc and florence nightingale done if youre a bookish type you might stretch to mary wollstonecraft wife of the more famous william godwin or mary shelley wife of the more famous shelley at a push you might get nell gwyn mistress of the more famous king charles ii known to the more famous samuel pepys as pretty nell but if the lely portraits are anything to go by pepys was probably being sarcastic she looked like jimmy tarbuck you might remember lady godiva wife of the powerful earl of mercia who rode naked through coventry to shame her husband into lowering taxes perhaps that was the only way for a woman to have any chance of influencing politics by marrying someone important then threatening to make her sexuality public if she wasnt listened to these days of course its the other way round dont knock richard timney for putting in the porn claim it was just his way of protesting against identity cards any more any more historical ladies after a really long think you might dredge up julian of norwich bride of the more famous jesus christ from the medieval period then its a long wait until the turn of the th century when you get mrs pankhurst marie curie and a couple of aviators but mrs pankhurst wife uniquely of the less famous mr pankhurst doesnt count since if other women had been accorded any value by history wed never have heard of her we have no idea what female influence there may have been on the men who wrote and fought and legislated throughout history for whole centuries its only logic that tells us women were even there but they probably were there david starkey werent they in roughly equal numbers with opinions and everything we might be allowed to hear their names as long as their influence was such that a king was prepared to split with rome and form the church of england in order to marry them unfortunately thats quite a big ask only one ever managed it so lets not erase her from the record books eh as for this notion of feminised history focusing too much on personal lives and creating a soap opera of the past why such scorn we could use a bit more of that approach history went wrong as a school subject when somebody decided to scratch all the old emphasis on character no more humpy richard iii virgin elizabeth i crafty guy fawkes or nasty hitler by the time i studied gcse history the syllabus was medicine throughout time half an hour on florence nightingale no mention of clara barton and two years on the surgical principles of the asclepian temple these days they study the history of twitter its said that you cant put a value on education but id certainly be prepared to offer if only we heard more about the wives and marriages family feuds and twisted flaws of character maggoty food and firehazard crinolines syphilitic explosions and writing of greensleeves kids might start enjoying the subject again making space for the role of women does not just make history more meaningful since without them we cant begin to imagine what the past was actually like it also makes it far far more interesting but you know that dont you david starkey and that is why you yourself five years ago published a book about the wives of henry viii and you knew that we would notice that hypocrisy bring up the old title in print and thus give you the doubleplug but april fool again dr starkey for i have room left only to mention that i am currently enjoying charlie brookers dawn of the dumb and recommend it as an excellent read failing that you cant go wrong with a bit of marina

its very how do they say in therapy conflicting as a feminist having to talk about the wags of the g first theyre all ws none of them are ags the sanctity of marriage in the lurve between a leader and a lady is the one cultural commonality of the whole bloody world apparently countries who invented the phrase womens movement can happily turn a blind eye to the leaders who have not one but seven wives though tactfully king abdullah bin abdul aziz al saud of saudi arabia didnt bring any of them but nobody would be so bold as to bring his girlfriend you see already i have got cross and i havent even got to the women who are attending the conference i have stalled at the ones who arent even there heres the thing feminist orthodoxy requires us to say some of them have highpowered jobs of their own this is true the australian first lady thrse rein is a selfmade multimillionaire she set up an ethical employment agency the canadian wife laureen teskey harper doesnt have what youd call an enormous career but she does have a motorbike and that goes a long way on so many levels michelle obama obviously had a tremendous career and now has a flexiconstitutional role we wouldnt want to sneeze at that by for instance talking to her about makeup all these women underline the loopy anachronism of wives being invited to the summit in the first place when they are people in their own right yet once you start down that culdesac the inference is that the wives who dont have jobs are secondleague those who have given their job up the better to perform helpmeet functions sarah brown or who werent allowed them by their tyrannical husbands russias svetlana medvedeva or whose authentic socialist beginnings on a factory floor prevented their getting a phd brazils marisa da silva or who have been similarly kept in a state of quasienslavement political correctness forbids me from listing the countries in which even women within the political elite arent worth a damn to anyone except as an earring tree you concentrate on careerist spouses and even those with impressive jobs the doctors the academics come to seem less worthy and the wives accidentally born into the political aristocracy japans chikako aso turn into the tim nicebutdims of the gathering in the very act of attempting a modern assessment of these spouses eyeing them through the prism of equality one ends up subjecting them to much harsher standards of excellence than anyone ever subjects their husbands to who knows what kind of a degree sarkozy got who cares and yet the alternative is to talk about their clothes and their upper arms and their nice smiles to accept that in a world of bread and circuses the men are the bread and the women are the circuses there is no way the leaders of the world can travel with their wives without some nauseating misogynist cliche being thus perpetuated apart from the problems of how you talk about these women what do you give them to do all day they cannot be part of anything serious they arent elected politicians so you need to arrange some trivia to busy them but it cant be too trivial at the g in japan last year they had a kimonofolding lesson i think that might have inched over the wrong side of the line charity visits are apolitical but deeply serious so finally a use for people who have terminal cancer the sheer gender insult of all this spreads like a virus though you have some state dinner like the one hosted by sarah brown at downing street on wednesday you need guests they end up being prominent women in fairness who else are they going to get its not a hen night plus the chippendales are too old so youve just got a roomful of randomly selected birds sarah browns mother over here jk rowling over there naomi campbell over yonder imagine if theyd celebrated the arrival of the obamas by getting all the successful black people they could think of into one room it would have been amusing to observe what the organisers would have done had the two husbands or first men decided to attend nstor kirchner is a former president of argentina himself mr merkel aka joachim sauer is a quantum chemist would they have folded kimonos or have been invited to dinner with rowling the truth is they couldnt have come it would have unmasked the whole thing for the absurdity it is whether or not they arrived at this conclusion themselves or were just casually not invited history doesnt relate there is no role for a political husband to inhabit he cannot be an adornment he cant be meek or unemployed because if hes emasculated the wife is defeminised and this dents her humanity since the basest understanding of a human is first off what sex are they but he cant be a powerful figure otherwise idiot talk flies about how shes the puppet and hes the master witness hillary it would be so much simpler if this hypothetical female leader were allowed to be single but of course that is totally taboo even more taboo than the lesbianism of which it was once held to be the obvious indication because the image of the female leader is still not truly accepted there is no acceptable role model for her husband either but the fact that these people exist these menhelpmeets with no wellworn groove to disappear into effectively turns them into free radicals waiting to make trouble rather were waiting for trouble to explode from them this isnt to say that david millss dishonesty doesnt reflect badly on tessa jowell in the case of richard timney left i think its actually a good thing that his porn scandal broke upon the pair of them since they were both claiming expenses and the piquancy of that story was the sight of smalltime moneygrubbing made er flesh but the fact remains a husband can only disgrace a wife in public office he can never bring credit to her since his attainments are not hers and the shame he unleashes in the event of misdemeanour is greeted so riotously we should really formalise it into a public holiday they disturb the natural order and must be punished the leaderhusbandcompanionwife conversely reinforces the natural order even when it makes no sense at all so they must be rewarded with cake and

women why arent you running the world yet frankly im disappointed in you men are still far too dominant for their own good and consequently weve made a testosteronesodden pigs ear of just about everything politics the economy religion the environment you name it its in a gigantic manwrought mess the worlds been one big dickswinging contest and weve caught our collective glans in a nearby desk fan by rights we should be squealing for your help but were not because were too damn stupid and too damn proud we swagger convincingly and thats about it and swaggerings fine for scraping by in primitive times but the world weve built is altogether more complex now weve got stock exchanges and nuclear warheads its too easy to swagger your way into big trouble without even realising well weve had our turn its time for the rise of the ladies we dont need a few women in conspicuous positions of power scattered here and there we need a year prohibition on all forms of male power seriously a decade in which men dont get to control anything from the remote control upwards imagine the consequences for one thing there would be an instant and massive reduction in armed conflict around the globe sure nations would routinely bitch about each other in secret and with a new haircurling viciousness but thered be fewer intercontinental punchups and a far smaller bodycount the economy should clearly be run by women city boys are dicks plain and simple look at them listen to them consider the carnage of the past years what the hell were these idiots thinking even now theyre still at it in any sane world theyd all be herded into a shed and blasted with hoses until they promised to stop everything they say think do watch read and fill up their ipods with is awful even their girlfriends are awful straight women reading this if your partner is a city boy leave him leave him now dump him with a text message right this very second itll hurt for about six days then your life will improve beyond measure sod that little numberswapping dick who dares call himself a man lob him in the shed with the other squeaking fakes and train the cold jets on the bastards shut the door and let them shiver men love machines because machines remind them of themselves as a result men quickly became very very good at building machines and then driving them round rather too quickly shouting toot toot look at me in my brilliant car this was cute for a while but the noveltys worn off now that the planets teetering on the brink of becoming an inhospitable cinder please women for all our sakes just lock us in a room with some lego or something im sorry but were just too bloody stupid to save the planet looks like youll have to clean up our mess once again mankinds depending on you this is all very well but none too realistic thinks the female reader men arent just going to hand over the reins that easily i know what men are like theyre selfrighteous and stubborn just like women but worse oh you pretty silly you weve got you brainwashed see thats what our incessant ruinous swaggering was all about pretending to be more complex and dangerous than we actually are in truth your suspicions are correct were very very simple were lazy and we like blowjobs thats all there is to us literally thats it from sir john betjeman to barack obama from copernicus to liam gallagher the core software we run on could fit in the memory of a digital watch circa without even scraping the sides and you know this you women you know this of course but its so dazzlingly obvious you actually doubt its true most of my friends are women i often find myself counselling them as they agonise for hours trying to fathom what men are thinking what men want yet no matter who theyre talking about or what the circumstance from my perspective the answer always seems so glaringly basic it could be scratched on the back of a button this one wants a shag that one wants a biscuit every time the butler did it the only mistake women make is crediting men with far more mystery than theyre capable of were impulsive yet thuddingly predictable and youd better learn to love us for it because thats just about all we can muster thats why we bollocksed the planet up we didnt mean to were men thats all and now surely now its time for you to shunt us off the podium and take charge for a decade if only as an experiment to see what happens i for one welcome our titted overlords give us our toys and our daily bread and permit us to lie on the sofa for whole years like snoozy spluttering pigs we get to loll

yes says sue evans partner with law firm lester aldridge llp the possibility of an employee taking maternity or paternity leave is most likely a factor considered by a number of employers albeit subconsciously maternity leave involves both pay and absence for the employer as the majority of pay can be recovered from the government it is often the issue of absence and return to work which causes greater practical problems under current provisions qualifying women receive pay for their first six weeks maternity leave with the lesser of a prescribed statutory rate currently per week or pay for a further weeks an additional weeks leave is then available bringing the total up to weeks paternity leave is for two weeks and is paid at the lesser of the statutory rate or pay either parent can take unpaid time off up until the child is five years old in qualifying circumstances the recent proposals from the equality and human rights commission working better report provide that for the first weeks of maternity leave a woman should be paid at of her salary beyond that leave can be taken in three blocks of fourmonth periods one for the mother one for the father and the third for either parent the proposal is that the first eight weeks of each block would be paid half at and half at the statutory rate long term the plan is for this leave to be paid at for weeks or for weeks these blocks could be taken any time up until a childs fifth birthday the ehrc is also proposing that the qualifying period of employment for entitlement to statutory maternity and paternity pay be dropped and that the two weeks paternity leave be paid at an employer can recoup the majority of maternity and paternity pay from the government however the employer will still have to devote resources to recruiting and training suitable cover for those on leave the arrangements would be a massive change for employers the blocks of leave would be like sabbaticals to care for the child the timeframe of five years within which parents could take leave could make this difficult it is likely to have a significant impact upon an employers ability to undertake strategic planning for the future only shortterm planning may be possible with the looming possibility that an employee may opt to take substantial periods of leave at present and as unpalatable as it may be when considering two equally qualified candidates for a role an employer may be minded to chose the male rather than the female this could obviously be discriminatory if the government goes ahead and changes the law as proposed in the equality bill an employer will be able to do precisely the opposite choose the woman as a form of positive discrimination and this would not be discriminatory however in conjunction with the ehrc proposals this will not actually assist either the employer or employee since it could be the male or female employee taking a block of leave the risk therefore is that it is employees with young children generally who are a cause of concern for employers this dilutes the intended impact of the positive discrimination no says nick clegg leader of the liberal democrat party parental leave in this country doesnt suit mothers or fathers or kids but whenever anyone suggests designing it around what families need critics pop up to claim that it would make life too difficult for employers the implication is clear you cant be a good parent and a reliable employee but lets look at this another way if we dont change the current arrangements for parental leave who is it that misses out when the pay rises are handed out or the promotions decided its women because our grossly unfair system gives fathers a measly two weeks to spend with their newborns compared to up to a year for mothers and for employers that all too often makes women a liability as long as parental leave is divvied up so unequally simply imploring companies to treat the sexes fairly wont get us very far because the way leave works perpetuates the idea that retaining and promoting women is bad for business while male employees are a much more rational investment hence the widening pay gap hence the glass ceilings hence the scandalous persistence of the notion that gender equality at work is all well and good but when push comes to shove its better for everyone that men take responsibility for bringing home the bacon and while women lose out at work men lose out at home many fathers would love to take on a more involved role with their young children but the division of labour entrenched by maternity and paternity leave emasculates those who seek to ive seen it firsthand at westminster earlier this year when i would mention that id be taking two weeks off following the birth of my son eyebrows were raised its ironic that this is where we legislate on improving the countrys worklife balance the equality and human rights commissions proposal for sharing leave much more evenly is a massive step in the right direction instead of asking employers to put their better nature ahead of their business nous it takes away the temptation to do otherwise but i do accept that planning around the ehrcs proposed blocks of leave would take a bit of getting used to for companies thats why my party has its own more straightforward proposals we would introduce months of interchangeable parental leave with no parent taking more than a year parents could divide it between themselves perhaps taking nine months each or they could choose to take time together and by insisting the leave is shared essentially on a use it or lose it basis we avoid the trap of mothers feeling under pressure to take the whole year and a half its also crucial to introduce these changes over time they would represent a revolution in worklife balance in britain and could not be introduced overnight although i differ on the detail with the ehrc i share the principle men and women with young children as well as those who are likely to have children at some point make up a major part of the workforce in the long run it is in the interests of employers to get the best out of these people companies benefit from loyal longserving staff understanding and facilitating their family needs is one way to get that return what do you think are you happy with the new parental leave

this most recent debate among feminists began with a naive assertion by nona willis aronowitz that mothers who write blogs are disconnected from feminists nonsense i said in a lengthy comment citing both momocrats and womencount both cover issues of interest to women and have begun working to influence political decision making for example yesterday i sent a message to the communications director for congressman tim ryan democratohio to ensure that he would cover womens healthcare during his television appearance absolutely he replied rep ryan and rep rosa delauro are working towards greater federal funding for those issues as well as contraception thats action while being a mom using social media social media is a great tool in the feminist arsenal in any arsenal it is extremely valuable to mothers who need schedule flexibility access to networks and efficient communication tools women built enormous influential networks online bloghers survey found women report they are significantly more likely to make a purchase decision based on customer experiences reported on blogs of women made decisions based on information they read in social media thats not limited to purchasing decisions women will also make choices about voting and issue position are perusing social media daily moreover up to are mothers mothers are talking influentially and mothers are listening politicians and corporations are listening but are feminists listening the article got coverage on other news sites and the myth that mothers are disconnected from feminists spread like wildfire i share aronowitzs concern that mommy bloggers arent flying the feminist flag but thats just the tip of the iceberg wrote one new mom and feminist again i disagreed asserting that we all need to instead focus on expanding the idea and concept of feminism to include the many and varied ways different women are working to improve the state of women then i went further and suggested we include men men can be wonderful allies in our cause in my article double x double slam women mothers marginalized more than ever i shared my husbands support of my efforts many men support feminism because theyre good people but there is purpose to it when women receive more equitable treatment for example at work through fair pay it benefits men too it benefits all of us however when i bring up parenting issues such as child care or family leave i hit the childfree feminist wall many call us breeders and say our choice to breed should not constitute special support a deep cut by a fellow feminist criticising our choice in the feministwon right to reproductive choice to some reproductive choice exclusively means choosing not to reproduce admittedly theyve got a right to be angry there is societal pressure on women to have children still and a study found that working women without children receive less respect from employers than working women with children it certainly seems to explain a perceived gap among feminists and feminist mothers that perceived gap can close though by broadening our concept not just of who constitutes a feminist but what constitutes feminism and activism if we think outside the now membership box we will see that many mothers may not be touting their feminist and activist achievements but that they are just doing it kyla hebert is young a mother a student working towards medical school and an activist she came to activism unintentionally her young daughter has a complicated condition that has affected her vision hearing and motor skills my friend began a blog to chronicle her familys challenges and triumphs her readership swelled but unexpectedly the family lost their health insurance cutting the toddler off from essential medical care kyla became an advocate for childrens health insurance program shes testified before government been featured in news articles and more shes exemplary of a broader movement the very act of blogging about motherhood is revolutionary and many women are very active motivating others to action as well some volunteer for nonprofit groups others work diligently in the schools some are community organisers on the grassroots level ensuring that the domestic violence shelters have clothes and goods some write about it but to most its simply one more thing they do because they care there might not be an acronym associated with it but it is still valuable and an important aspect of the feminist movement we cant overlook influential groups that work for women such as momsrising neither can we ignore mothers or men who advance the status of women and families people talk about the next wave of feminism theres an organisational chart heres the mission statement to include acknowledge and value the individual

i was prepared to hate double x see i read about slates new online magazine for women before i read it the site spawn of the now defunct slate blog xx factor has sparked a load of controversy in the feminist blogosphere its no wonder since it launched on tuesday double x has posted a succession of articles aggressively critical of feminism in fact on the day of the sites premiere writer linda hirshman penned a fingerwagging piece blasting the popular thirdwave feminist blog jezebel for encouraging young women in promiscuity and reckless boozing feminism is about womens equality double x is a magazine for women that the site would launch with a litany of hackneyed antifeminist pieces does not compute heres a taste of what i found there but the feminism of the first and second wave has never been the feminism or the womanism of my mother grandmother and greatgrandmother for example take the question of whether to work what some women struggled with as a point of politics my foremothers had done simply as a matter of survival feminism framed the issues in a way that spoke to different women from all walks of life then presented solutions that tended to favour women of a certain race and class ironically my lesbianism had something to do with this disenchantment with mainstream or institutional feminism there was always a difficulty of course even in the s one had puzzled over it namely what ones straight sisters were going to do how would they ever reconcile a putative belief in womens emancipation with what so often seemed an utterly depressing erotic and psychological fealty to men as a generation of young women is discovering and as polemicists from camille paglia to ariel levy have pointed out theres something missing in both points of view women can pretend theyre female chauvinist pigs but its still women who are more sexually vulnerable to stronger men due to the possibilities of physical abuse and pregnancy i was prepared to hate double x but i do not there is truth in these critiques if not necessarily for me for some women what many of double xs contributors seem to be railing about is feminism with a capital f the tired movement that tilts at old windmills and believes that the needs of a small group of women generally white urban upper middle class liberal heterosexual cisgendered american women are the needs of every woman the real struggle for womens equality has always been about feminisms many movements for many women of many races and many classes and many ages and many political persuasions in many countries and places onesizefitsall feminism is a lie because onesizefitsall womanhood is a lie so too the onesizefitsall formula for womens media double x is markedly different from popular and hightraffic feminist blogs such as jezebel and feministing that is ok those sites represent only one way to talk about and to women i do not agree with every point of view on double x hirshmans screed with its blaming of female victims of assault was loathsome but criticising double x for not adequately representing women is as misguided as hirshman accusing jezebel of harming women the modern womens

the feminist journalist and campaigner julie bindel explained on these pages last week that she has never worn makeup because she doesnt feel the need to dress for male attention she proceeded to point out that men are under no pressure to cover themselves in chemicals in order to look normal the piece attracted many responses from those who agree that makeup is unnecessary to others who embrace it wholeheartedly and prompted discussion around whether women really have a free choice about wearing it here is a selection of that feedback as a woman who chooses to wear makeup i have to disagree with this article i do not hide behind my makeup or use it as a mask i see it as an extension of my personality not a coverup i am creative and love decorating and painting things from my face to my fire escape i would argue that wearing makeup is actually more revealing of your personality than not you are painting your likes and dislikes your tastes all over your face you are saying this is how i choose to make myself look rather than this is how i was born and i see no reason to change it carlyylrac ive been an avid feminist all my life and also an avid makeup user i dont see myself as doing it for men at all i like to look my best in terms of face hair clothes just as i like my possessions and interior design to work well look good and reflect my personality men dont cover themselves in chemicals to attract women no but as all good feminists are aware they try to do it in other ways braying loudly about themselves buying penisshaped cars expensive suits expensive gadgets all equally boring skrim as my favourite feminist put it there are profound and powerful rewards in our society for women who conform to the femininity ideal correspondingly there are a variety of negative reactions to those who reject it ranging from simply being ignored to being verbally or physically attacked for looking say butch a free choice to shave your legs only exists if not shaving your legs is also a neutral option remember the fuss about julia roberts hairy armpits nothing neutral about that we all know the truth of this most of us have experienced the different reactions when were dressed up and when we slob out no one has said that succumbing to the endless pressure to look good is a betrayal of feminism however i would say that we owe it to ourselves to be honest enough to acknowledge those pressures finisterre i agree with every word you say julie but you missed something makeup costs loadsamoney my daughter recently bragged that she had bought yet another addition to her small suitcase full of makeup she has quite a low level habit say a month plenty of women could double that easily makeup comes in lots of pretty packaging in gorgeous colours my sixyearold granddaughter cant resist it any more than my daughter its about selling something jewellike to women who are constantly told they are hideous marketers simply have to convince women that they arent pretty enough and they have made a sale notvnocar we males are forced and conditioned into drabness from an early age and any attempt to break out of that is quite often met with hilarity and the imposition of a corrosive sense of shame women can dress in a masculine way and no one really bats an eye in fact there is practically no limit to the variety of dress and appearance open to women which they can access without stigmatisation plus they can use dress and makeup to transform themselves and to make themselves appear a lot more sexually attractive than they would be by just relying on their ordinary unadorned appearance whereas men are pretty much stuck with what theyve got robbo i have a skin condition called rosacea which during flareups causes a raised red rash across my nose and cheeks i have always covered this with makeup but recently because i suspect makeup exacerbates the condition i have experimented with going without during a flareup without exception it has been other women who have commented in a derogatory way about my appearance have you been drinking whats with the red nose rudolph etc if men have noticed then they havent commented or seemed bothered by it sadly it seems that women are our own worst enemies when it comes to perpetuating the beauty myth sidgrunge i think the personal choice argument regarding makeup doesnt entirely take account of the difficulties involved in not wearing it as someone said earlier youre not really making a free choice to shave under your arms if its socially unacceptable not to do so i wouldnt criticise anyone for wearing makeup i dont but im a sucker for hairbands plaits and costume jewellery so the appeal of dressing up isnt lost on me but it would be nice if people appeared without it rather more often just to establish the principle that it really is optional llamaperson i take a perverse pride in my incompetence with makeup as i do in my unpierced ears and inability to walk in high heels i frame these things as badges of my refusal to become a female impersonator as germaine greer says i have a friend who gets up in the morning three hours before she goes out so she has time to wash blowdry and style her hair apply her makeup and choose her outfit before she leaves the house and she is often late even if someone guaranteed me societys adulation i would not be willing to pay that price mscaparty its heartbreaking to read that some women think their best and their beauty can be bought at a cosmetics counter to me it screams insecurity neediness and conformity i am a girly gal and love dresses and skirts i just dont want to hide my face msim i really object to the notion that by choosing to put a bit of colour on my cheeks and a slick of mascara on my eyelashes im betraying the sisterhood and that all i really crave deep down is for men to think im pretty and ultimately want to have sex with me so that i feelworthy and more importantly can have millions of babies annarose,2009-05,feminist journalist campaigner julie bindel explained page last week ha never worn makeup doesnt feel need dress male attention proceeded point men pressure

julie bindel when can we do this email interview julie burchill whenever you like would be happy to do it asap am about till oclock and am in the mood ps i am going to a local synagogue to meet with a brilliant lesbian rabbi next thursday bindel who is the lezzer rabbi burchill dont have me saying lezzer can you imagine the pervs reaction bindel what word would you prefer burchill there isnt a word for homosexual i do like having said that i would never describe myself as heterosexual straight or anything else especially not bisexual it sounds like a sort of communal vehicle missing a mudguard i like spontaneous as a sexual description bindel you describe yourself as a militant feminist what does that mean to you burchill a girl who likes to have fun and a lot of other stuff obviously someone who realises that womens human rights are more important than cultural sensitivity like its sensitive to cut someones clitoris off someone who doesnt give a toss about the approval of others men and women a woman that cheeks and insults men righteously and politically but also for kicks and fun i like men and get on much better with them one to one than i do women who can be a bit emotional but part of what makes a man a man is that he never takes offence when you see sadsacks like what was his name neil something lyndon author of no more sex war the failures of feminism mens lib thats the opposite of a man to me just shut up and take your lumps and then we can all have a laugh obviously having had the father i had i have very high expectations of men on the whole in the west where feminism has made its mark i think theyve done great its so lovely that even in prison men who arent touchyfeely have to be stopped from beating up rapists not just child molesters but rapists of grown women its a shame that educated middleclass leftwing men cant take feminism on board so effectively bindel i much prefer women to men a lot of them are emotional cripples have you not found that are we such different feminists do you think burchill i dont want to hear about every last thing someone is feeling i think most men have it about right all men should be like my dad bindel i still have a laugh now about us falling out over princess diana i wrote in this newspaper that i fancied camilla parker bowles but never found diana attractive burchill oh my gosh did we i thought it was about israel wasnt there a time when you joined the islamlicking lobby and thought that i was some sort of zionist zealot my mistake bindel then we made it up temporarily and fell out again when i wrote in g that i thought that there were too many dildos in your tv drama sugar rush burchill ive said some dumbass things in my life but that was one of the dumbest totally agree with you and am totally baffled by sex toys there was a telling incident when i left a message for my husband and his flatmate picked it up when you come over tonight can you please bring the toys i was talking about zippy and george from rainbow bindel what on earth are you talking about burchill dan her husband and i arent loveydovey but we have zippy and george dolls that dan won in a torquay amusement arcade years ago during an amazing holiday we had there zippy says you know im really very clever and george says oh dear you are naughty for obvious reasons theyre very dear to us when we row we leave icy messages requesting their return whoever has them bindel i really laughed at this but does it mean you are not the sexcrazed vixen many men have you down as has marriage finally tamed you burchill i have always been married since i was went from tony parsons to cosmo landesman to charlotte raven to dan raven charlottes brother without a break so its the only life i know ive never been single but as i have such a rich inner life and am essentially a solitary person i dont feel the need to be i look at single people and they dont seem particularly happy as a species my advice is marry often and live apart best of both worlds bindel i have just read your new book not in my name a compendium of modern hypocrisy i loved it do you think you have ever been a hypocrite burchill if i have i cant recall it but then i cant recall a lot bindel are you a serial monogamist with your friendships you love them and then go off them burchill i am certainly very honest about my friendships and if i can tell that they have ceased to give pleasure to the people involved i will certainly end them i would rather be a great fullon friend for a short time than a drudging grudging friend for ever and ive seen a lot of mercy friendships i have a friend who would occasionally cry before she went to see a friend she was bored of and then cry again when she got back out of boredom remembered i persuaded her that this wasnt sensible and i think shes happier since i dont fall out with people easily but several female friends i have had to cut loose because they would press their unwanted sexual attentions on me when they were drunk and as ive said i fancy women very rarely and when i do theyre in their s its so sucky being a feminist hugh hefner you tell a broad in her s that shes too old for you to fancy it puts her in a mean mood and really sours a friendship and a lot of bitries as they hideously call themselves are very loath to take no for an answer they really think that if i slept with one woman i must want to sleep with them all im sorry but ick double ick bindel but why did we fall out then i didnt make a pass at you did i burchill ha ha i wish na it was just me being a bitch as per i thought you were too soft on islamists you thought i was orthogroupie supporter of jewish orthodox religion and then there was the camilladianasugar rush business just regular girl trouble bindel would you ever consider having sex with a woman again burchill i only like young women and i really dont want to be an old perv so best leave it bindel what do you mean young women burchill i only find young women attractive not kids obviously but girls in their s and only once about every five years so im hardly a seething volcano of sapphic lust bindel i know you get really pissed off with what seems to be a liberal consensus which results in a loverelationship between the british left and fascist muslim fundamentalists is the guardian also guilty of this burchill very much so its really weird how many allegedly leftwing men are prepared to forgive and even justify the most reactionary statements and behaviour so long as those peddling it are darkerskinned amazingly babyish and simpleminded bindel you are very outspoken about the burkha being a tool of womens oppression burchill apart from the obvious repressive and misogynist offensiveness of the burkha and it insults men as well as women implying as it does that they are slavering beasts who will turn into rapists with one glimpse of an ankle it strikes me as extremely disrespectful to the creator we are saying that the body he created is sinful and must be hidden away like a nasty little secret god created women to look like women he didnt create them to look like parrot cages with a nightshade chucked over it bindel i know you dont live with your husband how does that work burchill i like it very much im an only child and i like my freedom and privacy im not saying for sure that this will be my final marriage because people change but im still enjoying it after years and thats a record for me bindel what is your relationship like these days with cosmo landesman burchill i dont have relationships with my exes once youve sucked all the juice out of an orange why would you keep it around but his book starstruck was great fun especially the stuff about me bindel you told me once that you were giving up hackery to study religion but you didnt give it up did you lie or change your mind and did you go to jesus school anyway burchill i thought about whether sitting in a classroom i was planning to do religion at sussex not go to jesus school whatever that is debating how many angels can fit on a pin was a good way to understand christianity and i decided that i could learn more by doing voluntary work which i did for three years until my charcot diagnosis and subsequent bootincarceration put paid to this last autumn i loved it though and am very much looking forward to going back when my boot comes off soon burchill has advanced charcot syndrome a neurological disease that progresses from the nervous system to the bodys muscles sufferers gradually lose the use of the affected limb bindel how is your foot burchill healing very well aircast comes off in may the lord willing bindel is your christian faith still important burchill i would rather be a jew i find it hard to think of myself as an anglican while the head of the church is a cowardly suckup like rowan williams im hoping that dr john sentamu the archbishop of york will get the gig next hes my absolute hero bindel why would you want to be a jew burchill i love everything about the jews but i probably wont become one as i like the view from the outside i will probably just remain a christian zionist its a long and honourable tradition bindel what do you have lined up burchill i would love to write a book of short stories and a great television drama series my ultimate professional ambition is to write a song for girls aloud bindel do you have any regrets burchill i wish id started voluntary work earlier and slept around more ive been very selfish all my life if i have any regrets its to wish that id given more of myself to others less fortunate than me in all arenas mind you theres still time bindel thanks julie its really nice that we are friends again burchill its a pleasure i know weve had our spats but youre a proper heroine whereas i am a performing pony a really good one though i dont mind that youve slagged me off either in fact blush i get a very mild sex kick from it so there

i welcome tristram hunts contribution to bringing friedrich engels out of the shadow of marx and to prevent his being forgotten by history feminist friend or foe g april in these turbulent times engels still has much to say of relevance hunt rightly emphasises that engels was a pioneering feminist and gives prominence to his book the origin of the family private property and the state however i take issue with his claims of hypocrisy the article says friedrich engels condemned prostitution but enjoyed it himself in his wild youth while alone in paris for a short period engels enjoyed the company of les grisettes but these were workingclass girls who enjoyed a good time and were not synonymous with prostitutes in manchester he practically lived with mary burns an irish workingclass woman and after her early death with her sister lizzie he was as far as we know loyal to both in referring to the burns sisters hunt claims engels had once condemned the tendency of mill owners to take advantage of female hands here he did just that but there is no evidence that either of the burns sisters worked in the mill and rather than just a fleeting relationship with mary engels shared most of his free time with her in her humble cottage which he preferred to the official residence in town he was as a manager in the mill obliged to uphold her place was as he said a refuge in his double life as a revolutionary and as a capitalist after he left the firm he was finally able to live openly with lizzie burns as an accepted partner though he rejected marriage as a bourgeois institution and married lizzie only on her deathbed in respect for her religious sentiments even though they were functionally illiterate as hunt states mary and lizzie burns were both highly intelligent and passionate informed supporters of the fenian movement this relationship stimulated engels own interest in british colonial history and celtic culture in fact engels was not even a mill owner but an employee of a mill partowned by his father there he endured a job he hated for someone of his intellectual calibre and vitality sitting at a desk each day adding up columns of figures and dealing with the firms multilingual correspondence would have been extremely tedious and left little time for political activity or research engels never inherited the mill when his father died his family feared he would squander the legacy on his communist friends and he was unable to withdraw any capital from the firm for years he left the mill in but retained shares and invested in the stockmarket to provide an income that allowed him to continue supporting marx and to write and work for the cause of socialism engels did not hinder the establishment of socialism in britain as hunt suggests in another article the marxist misanthrope comment may he recognised the weakness of middleclass fabianism and often despaired about british pragmatism and the lack of interest in

in the united states as in the united kingdom weve just celebrated the centennial of fathers day it was first introduced a century ago but didnt become a legal holiday until but just what are we celebrating for decades pundits have been heralding the birth of the new father has he finally discarded his pupae stage and emerged a fullfledged multifaceted multitasking parental butterfly well yes and no the evidence from two decades of social science research paints a complicated picture on the one hand most american men now find themselves in a dualcareer couple in which both adults work outside the home across europe and the us young married men assume their wives will work outside the home and assume and desire a more active and engaged fatherhood than they often experienced with their own fathers the average american father spends three hours a day on the weekend with his family up significantly from estimates in earlier decades men are more likely to hug their children and tell them that they love them than in previous decades a poll in newsweek magazine found that of fathers say that being a parent is more important to them than it was to their fathers and say they spend more time with their children than their fathers spent with them on the other hand a dualcareer couple doesnt necessarily mean a dualcarer couple mens participation in housework and childcare continues to be best expressed by two twoword phrases we help out and pitch in we dont quite share in both europe and the united states mens increased participation in childcare also carries some dangers in many middleclass families dad is becoming the fun parent he takes the kids to the park and plays soccer with the kids she stays home what a great time we had with dad the kids announce as they burst through the kitchen door to a lunch mum prepared while also folding the laundry and vacuuming the living room american mens participation in family life lags behind the rates of participation in other industrial countries in australia canada and the netherlands mens rates are about double the rates in the us while in britain the rates are about higher its amazing what state policies that enable workfamily balance such as paid parental leave can do for involved childcare in fact the us is one of only five countries that offer no paid parental leave to either parent the others according to research by the project on global working families at mcgill university in canada are swaziland liberia lesotho and papua new guinea since we cant always rely on the opportunity provided by state policy we have to rely on increasing mens motivations simply put if american men are going to become the fathers they say they want to be we have to show them that it is in their interests to do so fortunately the evidence points decidedly in that direction research by sociologists scott coltrane and michele adams looked at national survey data and found that when men increase their share of housework and childcare their children are happier healthier and do better in school they are less likely to be diagnosed with adhd less likely to be put on prescription medication and less likely to see a child psychologist for behavioural problems they have lower rates of absenteeism and higher school achievement scores whats more when schoolaged children do housework with their fathers they get along better with their peers and have more friends and they show more positive behaviours than if they did the same work with their mothers because fewer men do housework than women said adams when they share the work it has more impact on children fathers model cooperative family partnerships when men share housework and childcare it turns out their partners are happier this is intuitively obvious wives of egalitarian husbands regardless of class report the highest levels of marital satisfaction and lowest rates of depression and are less likely to see therapists or take prescription medication they are also more likely to stay fit since they probably have more time on their hands and the benefits for men are even greater men who share housework and childcare are healthier physically and psychologically they smoke less drink less and take recreational drugs less often they are more likely to stay in shape and more likely to go to doctors for routine screenings but less likely to use emergency rooms or miss work due to illness theyre also psychologically healthier they see therapists are diagnosed with depression and take prescription medication less often they report higher levels of marital satisfaction they also live longer a finding that caused the economist to quip change a nappy by god and put years on your life oh and they have more sex research by psychologist john gottman at the university of washington also found higher rates of marital sex among couples where men did more housework and childcare this last finding was trumpeted by mens health magazine with the headline housework makes her horny although i suspect that is less true when she does it it is probably worthwhile pointing out that these are what social scientists call aggregate statistics over the longterm there is no onetoone correspondence and so i would advise male readers of this essay not to harbour any expectations if they rush home upon reading this essay and begin to load the washing machine but load it they should the evidence is clear that the more men share housework and childcare the happier and healthier are their loved ones as well as the men themselves fatherhood is not simply a state of being its a set of practices things people do and when men share those tasks that are normally called parenting everyone benefits,2009-06,united state

overburdened workingclass grandparents are far more involved in childcare than their middleclass counterparts a report on shifting social responsibilities reveals today and the experience may be driving them into poverty the trend towards later parenthood most pronounced among careerminded professionals is producing two distinct experiences of family life the charity grandparents plus suggests workingclass women are now four times more likely than wealthier couples to become a grandparent before their th birthday the statistics show and more than twice as likely to do so before their th birthday that trend the study suggests is imposing increasingly severe strains on poorer grandparents forcing them out of fulltime work earlier reducing pension contributions and accentuating socioeconomic differences for the middle classes the greater generational gaps between childrearing are resulting in beanpole dynasties with fewer children being born over longer periods by contrast the less welloff are sandwiched within compact family networks spreading across four or even five generations where grandparents face dual duties of extended support for elderly relatives thanks to increased longevity as well as caring for their childrens offspring the distinction between the two patterns is reinforced by several factors one is the greater geographical separation of middleclass families with grandparents opting for rural retirement and young professionals moving to follow job opportunities another is the fact that those in betterpaid jobs can afford to leave their children with nannies au pairs and private nurseries among professional families use such formal childcare arrangements the comparable figure for the unskilled according to grandparents plus is just the term grandfars has previously been coined to describe grandparents remote in distance and age from their grandchildren the cosy stereotypical image of the benevolent middleclass grandparent with the resources and time to spoil their grandchildren is familiar for some but it does not reflect the reality for many reads the charitys report the poor relation the disparity is most visible in the numbers of grandmothers under the age of that category accounting for about of middleclass women in had effectively disappeared by for workingclass women however the numbers doubled over the same period if you have a career and are a relatively high flier in your s you are less likely to do childcare said sam smethers the chief executive of grandparents plus if you have a lowpaid job that isnt satisfying you are far more likely to look after grandchildren but it hits pension entitlements the report notes longer life expectancy means that people are spending longer as grandparents this has resulted in a larger number of sandwich generation grandparents those with both living parents and grandchildren some of whom will also have dependent children living with them the uk has an expanding population of grandparents up from in to in there are around million grandparents half of whom are aged under latest figures show that the uk has the highest average age of mothers at first birth in the oecd younger working age workingclass grandmothers are among those most likely to be providing high levels of daytime childcare they also have a higher likelihood of giving up or reducing paid work than middleclass women the report says it suggests that for at least some of these younger grandparents it may be the struggle of combining caring for their families with work which explains why they are finding it difficult to manage financially that dilemma those with fewest resources being under most pressure has been observed elsewhere the report notes in the us young lone parent grandmothers particularly those from black and minority ethnic groups those who are already at greater risk of poverty stand the highest chance of being called upon to take on fulltime care of their grandchildren grandparents plus is calling for the childcare provided by grandparents to be rewarded financially the charity wants to see the governments taxcredit system extended to cover family members so that parents can pay grandparents for their childcare time and claim some of it back if policy is going to have a positive impact on the financial wellbeing of all generations the reports says it is essential we recognise and reward grandparents for the time they spend caring for their grandchildren as well as making sure work can be flexible and that it pays,2009-06,overburdened

out of sight out of mind that seems to be the case for mothers returning from maternity leave who according to reports are increasingly being singled out for redundancy in the economic downturn so what can you do if your boss targets you just because you are a new mum its extraordinarily difficult to pursue an action for pregnancy discrimination reckons ros bragg director of maternity action whilst the law is clear its often very difficult to prove plus women who are in the late stages of pregnancy or at home looking after a baby or who have just returned to work simply dont have the time or energy maternity alliance is part of a new campaign the alliance against pregnancy discrimination which also includes citizens advice working families maternity action the fawcett society and the single parents group gingerbread they all report an alarming rise in the number of women claiming that they have been victims of pregnancyrelated discrimination in the workplace working families helpline has received calls this year including at least one a month where a woman is dismissed on or soon after the day she informs her employer of her pregnancy case worker vanessa wheeler reports the case of a young single mum who was told maternity leave had been scrapped and that as a concession she could take two weeks annual leave following the birth she didnt take action fearing she would lose her job sophie worked at a wellknown media company for almost two decades and as business director held one of the most senior posts in march she returned to work after giving birth to charlie i was ready to go back after months leave i had a nanny and my fouryearold daughter was in fulltime nursery she says on my first day back my boss said hed meet me in the bar all very media instead of going to my office he walked me into a glasssided room in human resources in full view of everyone then the penny dropped sophie was told she was on notice of redundancy out of a department of about i was the only person made redundant i happened to be the only person on maternity leave she says her employer put her forward for two jobs neither of which were suitable in one case the prospective employer cancelled the interview half an hour beforehand and appeared to forget a second rescheduled one the second job was as she puts it totally inappropriate and the offer only made after she was made redundant they decided to get rid me after years unblemished record the treatment was appalling my overall feeling is one of anger and sadness camilla palmer an expert in discrimination law at leigh day amp co also a member of the alliance is advising sophie the question for women like her is what would have happened had she not been on maternity leave if she would not have been made redundant but for her maternity leave this will be discrimination the courts have also said that if there is a failure to consult a woman because she is on maternity leave that in itself is discrimination current legal protections are in theory at least very strong but as cathy rogan rights adviser for working families says there are two significant difficulties women have to prove discrimination and they have to enforce those rights proving discrimination is often problematic particularly where it amounts to snide comments and a gradual freezing out says rogan if you suspect this keep notes and talk to your employer if that doesnt work there is always the employment tribunal take speedy advice from an adviser who specialises in maternity discrimination you have to bring a claim within three months less a day of the act complained of there is no legal aid to pay for a lawyer to represent you although there might be for initial advice a good place to start is the working

more than three decades before sex and the city became a television phenomenon helen gurley brown wrote sex and the single girl a guidebook for women who wanted to live large and stay single the book was a rallying cry for unmarried women exploding myths of lonely spinsters and became a sensation on both sides of the atlantic it was published in countries and languages and the fame it brought led brown to the position for which she became legendary editor of cosmopolitan magazine with its provocative covers featuring lots of hair bare skin and cleavage the magazine quickly came to stand for a new kind of female fearless independent and undeniably sexy it too became an international success after the british edition was created in other countries followed and the magazine eventually reached more than m readers around the world over the years brown has been interviewed by countless journalists but ignored by scholars critics point out that she peddled cleavage on every months cover of cosmo suggested that women should work the system rather than overthrow it and even saw her offices taken over by protesting feminists yet to me brown deserves a place in the pantheon of thcentury feminist leaders she was not just an infamous promoter of womens sexual liberation she was a workingclass womans role model who declared herself her magazine and her message feminist but can a woman who peddled cleavage be a trailblazer helen gurley brown was an early and influential advocate of open discussions about female sexuality in the postwar period western women got lots of advice on how they should live their lives namely through men and marriage with sex subordinate to both single women who could not attract a husband were pitied single women who had the temerity to choose not to marry were scorned during those years brown a secretary and then an advertising copywriter held off on marriage and dated widely including colleagues and bosses living as she would advocate for her readers in superlative style she allowed herself to feel and act on sexual desire which she considered as natural for women as for men you inherited it she said simply encouraging other women to allow themselves the same sexual desires and freedoms men enjoyed when sex and the single girl hit the bookshops in browns philosophy resonated deeply and broadly the book spent months on the bestseller lists and was published in countries the kinsey reports the fruits of research into postwar sexual practices had already demonstrated that americans practised more sex than they preached sex and the single girl went further it offered women inspirational case studies rather than scientific analyses women who hoped to find their own proclivities for sex and sensuality affirmed found in the unapologetic brown the spokeswoman they craved by focusing on womens calls for steamy sex rather than matching washerdryers she developed an enormous following among single and married women alike in the aftermath of the books publication she received so much fan mail that her local post office eventually decided they would no longer deliver it three years later brown took over the ailing cosmopolitan magazine in part to connect with these devoted fans her followers considered her a liberator who freed them from the confines of an outdated but still intact ideology brown also came to understand that her high sales figures meant she could have fairly free reign over her publications which included numerous books but had she had her way lesbian sexuality would have emerged in her writings from the start brown fought first with her publisher and then with the higherups at hearst to include queer sexualities not as aberrations but as normal elements of grownup life in drafts of her most important books and in the template for cosmo she had stories of lesbians inside and outside of the workplace brown lost the battle several times but waged it anew from time to time wanting to celebrate the many ways in which women found expression socially and sexually her notions about sex were lesbianfriendly from the start browns famous cosmo covers were visual examples of her philosophy and they resonated with millions of women and across more than three decades contrary to what some other feminists might have believed or hoped brown intuitively understood that not just men but women enjoyed looking at beautiful women and believed that all women benefited from seeing female sexuality writ large she understood well that women as feminists later would claim performed femininity as they put on and took off skirts of varying hemlines cosmetics and heels she balked at the idea promoted by other feminists of the day that women had to forgo these practices to become liberated yes womens sexy appearances invited men to look but brown would never apologise for that sex and sexiness formed tools if not weapons in womens arsenal unlike betty friedan the author of the feminine mystique who wanted to liberate middleclass housewives from their boxedin lives or gloria steinem whose ms magazine targeted collegeeducated women brown deliberately targeted workingclass women with her game plan for liberation a child of the great depression who came of age in a singleparent family she had the brains but not the opportunity to attend college instead she worked in lowpaying whitecollar jobs in her earlier years and felt an affinity for the secretaries retail clerks and airline attendants who read her books and magazine like her these women often had to find ways to work the system since they hardly had the privilege to beat it even if they wanted to leave off wearing makeup and dresses which many did not they would have been hard pressed to find jobs that allowed them to reject the female uniform of the day these women largely pursued jobs not careers and if they worked the system again after hours by relying on men to pay for their nights out well they could hardly have had much of a social life on their salaries alone it wasnt that brown did not push for greater changes for women she actively worked for the equal rights amendment which would have constitutionally guaranteed women in the us rights equal to those of men and for reproductive rights including abortion she looked for opportunities to promote the practical changes endorsed by more political feminists but still maintained that her women had to play the system as best they could brown advocated work not men as womens greatest ally but she also understood the limitations of the work world just as she understood the limitations of men she knew that her workingclass followers might find only one or two job titles available to them regardless of their skills and might repeatedly watch lessqualified men be promoted over them they should as a result always allow men to pay for nights out for babysitters if they were single parents and for alcohol if they happened to invite a man in to their apartment when others repeatedly faulted her for this philosophy of manipulating rather than refashioning the economics of sex and gender relations browns response was simple and direct i deal in reality in feminists targeted cosmopolitan among other womens magazines as being hopelessly stuck in an anachronistic past they took over the offices of the staid us womans magazine the ladies home journal and once inside feminists were able to push the magazine to offer greater coverage of womens paid work and interests outside the home but when they tried to take over the offices of cosmopolitan and demand feminist content they encountered not an uncertain male editor but a woman who let them know that she saw her magazine as already feminist her readers she knew wanted to read about men and sex as well as money and work and she saw it as her responsibility as a feminist to give them more rather than fewer choices about how they lived their lives in the end many women who remained only partly aware of or unmoved by other feminist leaders found an affirming vision and voice in brown countless women were touched by this pioneer who promoted womens empowerment and feminism in her own upbeat practical and fearless way bad girls go everywhere the life of helen gurley brown by jennifer scanlon is published by oxford university press on

the number of pregnant women and new mothers losing their jobs has shown an alarming rise as employers target them for redundancy ahead of childless colleagues according to an alliance of support groups launched this week the alliance against pregnancy discrimination in the workplace has identified a sharp increase in women consulting lawyers or calling helplines because their jobs have been terminated during maternity leave or pregnancy it appears that some employers are using the recession as an excuse to break the law on discrimination the alliance warnedyesterday campaigners said that the longterm consequences of job loss as a result of pregnancy or maternity leave jeopardise womens financial security for their whole lives about women are estimated to lose their jobs as a result of pregnancy every year according to the equality and human rights commission but that figure is expected to rise because of the economic downturn the government is not collecting data on this kind of discrimination and it is too early for the tribunals service to have tracked a spike but campaigners say a wealth of anecdotal evidence suggests there has been a steep increase camilla palmer a lawyer specialising in pregnancy and maternityrelated discrimination with leigh day amp co said that more people were losing their jobs across the board but that pregnant women and new mothers appeared to be disproportionately affected cases where women on pregnancyrelated leave lost their jobs because whole departments closed were discounted she said but the firm was dealing with more calls from new mothers singled out for redundancy the increase in calls from women concerned about pregnancyrelated unfair dismissal was so steep that the company launched a dedicated helpline last month to offer preliminary advice on employment rights in this area elizabeth gardiner parliamentary policy officer at working families a campaign group on worklife balance that is part of the alliance said women had approached them with more severe examples of discrimination in recent months employers seem much more willing to flout the law she said campaigners are concerned that attitudes towards maternity rights have hardened among many employers whose businesses are struggling in the economic downturn the alliance believes that new mothers will be seen as fair game for dismissal during the recession

despite government consultations and highprofile failings such as the john worboys case violence against women continues to be a hidden issue in many communities particularly rural ones new research commissioned by the national federation of womens institutes confirms this low profile with nearly three in four of women reporting that issues such as rape domestic violence and sexual harassment are not talked about openly in their local area the impact of this is farreaching a failure to acknowledge the widespread scale and nature of domestic violence only compounds the sense of isolation felt by many sufferers looking at the statistics it is impossible to believe that any woman suffers alone but the awkward silence across many villages and streets will make it feel as though she does most people accept in principle that violence against women is a problem but there is often a reluctance to think it happens to people like them this seems to be especially true in rural areas where our research found respondents were less likely to think violence against women occurred in their communities despite the research finding equal levels of abuse among rural and urban women furthermore the specialist services women need to seek justice and rebuild their lives are unavailable across great swaths of the country local authorities will always bend to the loudest voices and petitions over pot holes will make a bigger impact in town halls than a collective silence over rape and domestic violence the postcode lottery of support services is well documented with research finding one in four local authorities lacking any specialist services for violence against women our research concurred with rural women reporting they had least access to services such as rape crisis centres and womens refuges the services women trust most to tackle violence against women and low reporting rates continue to suggest that women lack confidence in the police with most people choosing to disclose to friends and family in the absence of expert support systems but friends and family cannot be expected to help women navigate complex legal systems and extricate themselves from potentially fatal situations friends and family are also not immune from the unhelpful myths that continue to condone violence against women and focus attention on victims rather than perpetrators behaviour when our researchers asked women who had experienced violence why they did not seek help sooner three themes emerged a sense of shame the lack of services and scepticism when they had tried to seek help by keeping quiet about violence against women we are failing vulnerable victims cultural attitudes are not impervious to change successful campaigns against drinkdriving have shown that the national federation of womens institutes is calling for the government to lead a real national conversation on violence against women and launch a nationwide campaign condemning it this must challenge the attitudes that accept it contradict the myths of what violence against women looks like and inform women what help is available only by speaking out loudly and impatiently against it can we end

jeannie was just and married for less than a year when her husband began beating her for almost a decade she lived in fear of a man she says was controlling vicious and whose behaviour was psychopathic he beat her regularly putting her in hospital many times estranged from her family and with small children to bring up jeannie felt totally isolated what made matters worse she says was living in a closeknit rural community which made it difficult to talk openly about family problems there was no one for me to talk to absolutely no one when i ended in hospital i was simply patched up and sent home again now in her early s happily married to another man and with the years of abuse long behind her jeannie is one of the members of the womens institute campaigning for the voices of rural victims of domestic violence to be heard the wi which in recent years has swapped its jammaking image for campaigning on tough social issues ranging from mental health in prisons to chemical pollution has championed the struggle against domestic violence for some time today it is calling for the government to launch a national public information campaign to raise awareness of the problem and the particular difficulties that women in rural areas face it will also demand better local facilities for women at risk and will recommend training for gps to help them identify women affected jeannie like others in the wi who are attending its annual meeting today in london is determined to use a new piece of research to show that rural domestic violence is a hidden problem the research carried out by bristol university surveyed almost women in urban and rural settings were wi members it found that although the occurrence of domestic violence was similar everywhere women in rural areas assumed it was more of a problem in cities they were also more likely to be concerned about confidentiality if they came forward to ask for help and wanted better local services to help those in trouble the main distinction between rural and urban women was in terms of isolation and lack of services in rural areas including transport for women to reach and use existing services the report concludes the wi chair fay mansell says domestic violence remains a hidden issue in many areas many victims do not speak out due to fear and shame we want people in all communities to acknowledge that violence is there and takes many forms not just physical abuse it is time the government launched a campaign to end violence against women lack of services nicki norman deputy chief executive of the charity womens aid praises the wi research for drawing attention to the additional problems women in rural communities face she points out that these often intensify their sense of isolation this is then exacerbated by the lack of available services with a quarter of local authorities in britain still having no specialist service for women at all she says as well as awareness campaigns longterm funding for specialist support services for rural women and their children needs to be bolstered norman says over the last few years investment by the government has focused mainly on criminal justice responses to domestic violence without a requirement from central government to address violence against women at a local level services will diminish domestic violence is an issue for every community and funding must be made available so that access to safety and support is not dependent on which area women live in kate webb research and campaigns officer at the wi says the research was carried out because of growing awareness that little was known about the problems of victims of domestic abuse outside towns and cities because of our background in rural areas a lot of politicians and policymakers were asking us what the specific issues were she says but when we looked we realised there was very little research on this subject although the government has launched some good initiatives around domestic violence webb says until now little was known about how aware rural women are of the help that is available the wi research found that women are largely ignorant of even basic services such as the national domestic violence helpline an easily accessible telephone service that could be a reliable first port of call for isolated women the research shows that statutory and voluntary services alike need to think local and consider more imaginative approaches including outreach services to find women who need them webb says its not just about what services are available its about making sure women know what is available and where a spokesman for the home office which is leading the governments domestic violence strategy says everyone has a responsibility to address violence against women and girls within our families within our communities at our places of work or study and within our society at large he adds that government recognises that raising awareness of violence against women which includes physical and psychological harm is critical to raising awareness and preventing harm in the future we welcome this report from the national federation of wis which provides valuable information on how best to target such work he says a crossgovernment consultation launched by the home secretary has just ended on violence against women and girls it is the biggest consultation this country has seen on this issue it has been very highprofile and the government engaged with the public frontline professionals and service users to inform a crossgovernment strategy now a deputy chair of her local wi branch jeannie believes that more publicity about the fallout of domestic violence on women and families is essential i dont know why the message still isnt getting through she says the wi is a big organisation with thousands of members and it is right that they speak out on this issue theres strength in numbers and i really think we have a chance of being listened to details of the wi domestic violence campaign are at thewiorguk the national domestic violence helpline is women on top ever since the wi slowhandclapped tony blairs speech on traditional values at its annual meeting in june its public perception as women who just make jam or knit has well and truly altered however what is perhaps less well documented is the degree to which the organisation has thrown itself into campaigning and lobbying on issues that are far removed from its conventional image domestic violence has become a key plank of the organisations campaigns culminating in this years push on the issue along with membership of the end violence against women evaw coalition other campaigns include mental health in prisons a focus since a member brought the plight of women in prison with a mental illness to the annual meetings attention the wi has been lobbying for policy changes that would prevent people with mental health problems being placed in prison instead of a mental health facility climate change a growing area of interest for wi members covering issues such as the link between women in developing nations and climate concerns as well as galvanising women in the uk to campaign on environmental matters protests and democracy encouraging women to vote protests against closure of community hospitals and local

barbie dolls have been widely derided by feminists since they first appeared years ago accused of objectifying women and portraying an unrealistic view of the female form and yet given how many personas manufacturers mattel have given barbie over the years would it be possible to make a feminist barbie if so what she would wear hold the dungaree and body hair jokes for just as women come in all shapes and sizes despite barbies improbable vital statistics feminists come in all different outfits too barbie has outfits for dancing and outfits for watching tv outfits for the boardroom and outfits for cleaning the loo and perhaps it is wrong to consider making a specifically feminist barbie because feminism is not about one single look identity or set of rules and all of these outfits could potentially be feminist barbie and just as you cannot judge a barbie doll or a feminist by her outfit you cannot judge a feminist book by its cover in these pages last week libby brooks did just that in deriding my book the noughtie girls guide to feminism for being indistinguishable from a chick lit novel this was a deliberate design decision to appeal to readers who wouldnt normally pick up a book with feminism in the title its target readers are those women and men who start conversations with im not a feminist but before going on to espouse feminist concepts such as equal pay and better division of domestic labour these feminisnts as i call them are put off precisely because they feel that to be a feminist you are expected to look a particular way and sign up to a very specific set of beliefs the feminism i believe in has at its core two beliefs equality and choice it demands that women have equal access to work opportunities money and property and that they are judged on behaviour sexual or otherwise by the same standards as men and it demands choice over the many daytoday decisions in our lives what it doesnt do is tell you what choice you must make essentially that means that a woman could make many traditionally feminist choices such as using the title ms keeping her surname if she gets married having a successful career and sharing domestic and caring responsibilities but she could equally well choose to do none of these and still be a feminist i have come under criticism for diluting feminism by emphasising this choice and therefore as one critic put it making the concept of feminism less scary but feminism should not be scary or a fringe movement it should be a movement for the good of all society perhaps the key difference between me and my critics is that while i am keen to look at our everyday lives in the context of the society in which we live they seem to prefer the idea of overthrowing the patriarchy the belief that society is run by men to the detriment of women not only do i think it is impossible to start again redrawing society from the beginning according to an equal opportunities policy but if its just going to be replaced with a prescriptive matriarchy that discounts the idea of individual choice i am not sure that i want to my feminism is about realism looking at the issues and choices that face us every day what to wear whether to put on makeup who cooks dinner whether the route home is safe whether to apply for promotion at work and so on to see an insistence on choice in these areas as individualism is lazy because theres nothing inherently individualistic about making your own choice providing it does not adversely affect others in fact making our own choices about our lives and enabling others to do so is far better for the collective than being told what we must believe in and what we must do by selfappointed moral arbiters,2009-07,barbie doll widely derided feminist since

oh its like ruddy buses you wait a decade for some britborn feminist literature then four books come along at once since natasha walters new feminism a work as buoyantly optimistic as the new labour moment it refracted came out in mainstream publishing about gender has been horribly absent in this country sure there have been the us buyins to keep us talking susan faludis discourse on the consequences of for women ariel levys roar against raunch culture jessica valentis full frontal feminism and undoubtedly theres been a platform shift the hottest discussions about british feminism now happen online at sites like the fword or between cluedin types on twitter so this is really not reflective of my luddite thrill at having another volume to slot into my bookshelf next to marilyn french its an opportunity to think the hard thoughts and to ballast the resurgence of activism with theory over the next months four very different women of diverse ages and agendas offer their slant on contemporary british feminism hopefully generating a level of debate that we men as well as women havent known for years kat banyard of the fawcett society assesses the equality illusion examining how the language of liberation has become coopted and arguing that feminism remains the most important motor for social justice of our time catherine redfern founder of the fword surveys the activist trend and uncovers why younger women are engaging like never before walter returns to the fray challenging a cultural sexism she admits she didnt take seriously enough in her last book all three will be published early next year and lest this read like a roll call of knityourownyoghurt worthiness ellie levenson a writer with rather less locus than the three aforementioned has delivered her noughtie girls guide to feminism complete with rape gags and a section on why women bosses are shits as i write this shes just tweeted about how she can be a feminist and still have a leg wax yawn ok so that last paragraph requires some deconstruction its wrong to suggest that banyard redfern and walter will be received as dull because theyre serious just as i shouldnt imply levenson isnt serious because she doesnt have a bachelors in gender studies but does have jokes its as well i didnt say that observing feminism wont wind you up in a huge fankle but herein lies the particularly scratchy rub what levenson suggests with a spangly cover that renders her book indistinguishable from the latest marian keyes novel is that feminism needs to be rebranded to be made friendlier and more accessible to women born after who balk at the word though not necessarily the principles it represents while agreeing its a cute marketing ploy to pass off politics as chick lit im already exhausted if we are to have the nomenclature discussion all over again plus levensons invocation of a judgmental cohort of older feminists beating up their daughters for choosing to shag around with shaved legs resurrects another weary canard that secondwave feminists of the s and s were pofaced antisex misandrists and there is a line not a skip and a jump away from the medias appetite for women fight like cats in a bag again stories that suggests all feminists go into lockdown when presented with a thesis that doesnt fit their own prescriptive view i just dont buy that in a blog about initial responses to her book levenson says infighting harms feminism but does it the women i meet of every generation are desperate for debate especially if it can be conducted under the unflattering lights of the mainstream and take in katie price as well as crappy rape conviction rates and when older women remind younger ones about the history of the movement its because many of the answers to our present day questions can be found there if infighting means having an unashamedly intellectual rigorously conducted unflinchingly honest discussion about what feminism is and what it isnt at the end of the noughties then count me first in the ring and i wont be alone consider object the campaign group that has recently gained traction for its work on lapdancing club reforms its meetings are stuffed to the rafters with twentysomethings both female and male who have clocked that their right to choose striptease lessons does not obviate the exploitation inherent in the industry and yes the presence is predominantly white middle class and university educated as are the writers of these books so lets get infighting about that too feminism can never equate with individualism no matter what the pickandmix proselytisers might tell you that a single woman feels empowered to make a particular choice means nothing if the grassroots organisations and political lobbies dont exist to manifest real social shifts it is still collective theory and collective action that changes the world at a moment for british feminism when the theory is fresh and the action is vibrant all of us should be thinking and doing and mindful that theres nothing so empowering as a good scrap about what we believe in,2009-07,oh like ruddy bus wait decade britborn feminist literature four book come along since

if the stereotype of a feminist is an angry woman steam streaming righteously from her ears then dr katherine rake seems the polar opposite the director of the fawcett society the uks leading campaign for womens rights is a calm avuncular presence with an unnerving ability to pluck silver linings from clouds as with most public feminists she has faced some vicious ire in her time with a commenter on the guardians website apparently denouncing her as worse than hitler does she balk at the backlash no i dont think its been a problem she says sunnily as we sit by a canal drinking coffee comments like that remind you that there are people who really struggle with the idea that you should afford women dignity and respect then unexpectedly she finds an upside to such attacks i think those people are actually an endangered minority and thats one of the reasons theyre so venomous because they know the tables are turning its an impressive sleight of hand rake has needed all the magical thinking she can muster over her last seven years at fawcett a period during which she has established herself as one of the countrys most prominent feminist voices because fawcetts remit is incredibly wide hers has been too the group campaigns for more representation of women in parliament a better deal for ethnic minority women an end to maternity discrimination it has also encouraged people to embrace the term feminist and spoken out against the postcode lottery for rape victims today is rakes last in charge of the organisation and she leaves it in good standing with supporters and a turnover that has tripled in the time she has been in control but this hasnt been an easy era to campaign for womens rights while its often assumed that the movement towards equality is one of constant progress there has actually been significant slippage with the uk sliding down the world economic forum rankings on gender equality and the pay gap widening last year says rake currently only one in five of british mps are female if the conservatives sweep to power at the next election those numbers will sink further the sex industry has gained ground with easy access to pornography meaning the objectification of women on a daily basis almost goes unnoticed says rake its not just hardcore pornography thats a problem i remember an article a couple of weeks ago about profits at next and what was it illustrated with a picture of a woman in her underwear when did that become normal and accepted then theres maternity discrimination its estimated that women are forced out of their jobs each year simply because theyre pregnant rake says that the number of calls to fawcett about this issue have been rising since the recession began and of course theres the rape conviction rate this has crept up in the last few years from to around for reported rapes which end in a conviction on that charge so the movement is absolutely tiny she says fawcett recently highlighted that in dorset less than one in women who report a rape secured a conviction on that charge yet somehow rake finds the positive side of even this most devastating fact she notes that in cleveland one in five reported rapes ended in a conviction and says that this provides a beacon of hope it shows that its not beyond the wit of humankind to get a decent provision of services for rape victims the rape debate seems to push her closest to fury so much of it focuses on alcohol she says and this question of whether a woman is culpable if shes been drinking i mean most of the victims of gbh are drunk but nobodys ever suggested that there should be a lesser charge for defendants in those cases as soon as you draw that parallel you think well the argument surrounding rape is an absolute outrage is that the issue on which shed be most likely to cast off her calm rational approach in favour of a radical one then she laughs on a personal level of course i get incredibly irate about certain issues but for the organisation i dont know that being angry is necessarily a healthy way of creating change shouting at people doesnt actually get them to move very much what fawcett says is based on evidence and often on a very technical and detailed understanding of the policy areas on that basis were very challenging the government and the opposition parties say they feel were pushing them to change their agenda very hard rake was brought up as the youngest of four children to parents who held progressive values and a mother who was she says very feminist as a result she has always had a strong belief in womens rights after studying at the lse rake did postgraduate work on womens access to pensions and while this wasnt obviously the most exciting topic it was one that i found deeply fascinating in the s she lectured at the lse and was seconded to the labour governments womens unit where she put together a report on the lifetime cost of the pay gap she is a bit of an anorak at heart naturally drawn to policy and research and the evidencebased approaches to change that would send some people to sleep but her tactics seem to work in her years at fawcett the group has helped ensure significant political movement and raised the profile of issues as varied as womens pensions and most recently the licensing of lap dancing clubs her feminist heroine is naturally millicent fawcett who began her peaceful campaign for womens votes in and saw it reach fruition in when women were finally granted the vote on the same terms as men fawcett died a year later she had run a more moderate campaign than some suffragettes but was incredibly determined says rake and also very visionary while the suffrage colours were green white and violet standing for give women votes fawcetts were green white and red which stood for give women rights so she always understood that the vote was a gateway to a much bigger set of requirements for equal citizenship and she fought for that all her life what keeps rake chipper in the face of backlash and backsliding she says is that feminist issues are now common parlance common currency i think that theres been a rebirth of consciousness these issues arent just the province of one political party any longer theyre an issue for all the political parties her next challenge lies at the research organisation the family and parenting institute and she leaves fawcett for now in the hands of her other feminist icons the young activists who work at the organisation they totally blow my socks off she says theyre full of passion and enthusiasm and are all incredibly committed to the cause and they give the lie to the idea that there is no new feminist generation and with that she heads off to have her photograph taken positive to the

women with children earn about less than their male colleagues according to a new report that explores the devastating impact of motherhood on earnings before becoming parents men and women are equally likely to be employed but childbirth marks the start of a great divide which continues even after children have left home and does lasting damage to womens careers the report finds around of mothers with children under five are in paid work compared with of men according to the research published by the fawcett society partnered women without dependent children earn less than men on average but for mothers working fulltime who have two children the pay gap with men in the same situation is for each year she is absent from the workplace a mothers future wages will reduce by says the study entitled not having it all how motherhood reduces womens pay and employment prospects mothers are also much more likely than fathers to adjust their work to fit in with their childrens schedules it is critical that those mothers who choose or need to be in paid work should be able to do so without suffering a pay penalty said katherine rake director of the fawcett society mothers often return to work parttime which has a critical impact on wage levels this is because parttime work is more likely to be low paid and women working parttime are less likely to be promoted will have less access to training and are more likely to be made redundant mothers are faced with impossible choices to find jobs that are compatible with childcare they have to make major compromises trading down their careers so that they can meet their childrens needs the challenge now for government is to support mothers to maintain their position in the workforce and achieve the family life that they want rake said the pay penalty is one of the highest in europe according to separate research published by the university of manchester the study showed that working mothers in the uk are half as likely as childless women to work in highearning professions and eight times more likely to work parttime these figures put the uk in last place out of the six countries studied the others being finland denmark germany the netherlands and france poor access to childcare is the main reason for this disparity the report concludes britain offers the shortest parental leave entitlement of all six

i awoke yesterday in ira levins brain scientists have used embryonic stem cells to make synthetic sperm my first thought is does it come in pink but the possibility grows and im wilfully hopping and skipping and bouncing over the science bit here that we will at some vague point in the future be able to breed without men and so a misanthropic fantasy is conjured what would a world without men be like would it be a gently slumbering paradise full of women eating pot noodles and watching dallas would there be more gilded stripy cushions but less armed robbery or would it be like being trapped in an overeaters anonymous meeting or at an all girls school for ever let us examine our history and see how men the master race for all of our recorded history in almost every corner of every human civilisation have fared so far applying all the fairness and equilibrium of my sex naturally and then i must ask myself could women do better war girls dress dolls boys stab them from action man to adolescent stabbings to creaking armchair generals shouting at fox news while eating cheese straws men have always enjoyed or been willing to maim not all men are drooling warlike psychopaths but most drooling warlike psychopaths happen to be male complain if you must but surely this doesnt happen by accident freud said nothing happens by accident not even an overboiled egg where did that sea of blood come from obviously war has at times been an agent for useful social change smashing the nazis plucking women out of the kitchen and into the workplace and so forth but generally speaking i think most humane humans would agree that wars are a bad thing and on the whole women dont do war defensively maybe but not for fun and not to compete with other women because we know that there are worse things you can do to another person than merely kill them nah i cant be bothered to invade russia enders is on then holby city arms race to buy bracelets possibly leadership it would be mean to list only the maniacs but i cant resist there are so many flowers in this garden edward i flayed his enemies and nailed their skin to the chapel of pyx then he invaded scotland because it was there would he have done this if he had been a woman i doubt it no woman would use skin as a wall motif ivan the terrible threw cats why cats off the walls of the kremlin and thumped people with redhot pokers because they were there joseph stalin watched musicals while his peasants starved female rulers i am certain can and have already done better not always indira gandhi suppressed womens rights and elizabeth bathory murdered random virgins and no i havent forgotten margaret thatcher but elizabeth i practised religious tolerance in england while it was still fashionable to eat protestants in france icelands prime minister jhanna sigurardttir liberian president ellen johnsonsirleaf and helen clark who has just finished four terms as pm in new zealand are all seemingly sane they stand for fewer insane policies and less mass murder due to feelings of inadequacy which im in favour of religion if you believe as i do that religion is more dangerous than an elephant on cocaine wearing high heels in legoland the invention of religion is a very black mark against the creatures that love football in the dock we have abraham of ur kasdim representing judaism st paul of tarsus and joshua of nazareth in the catholic later protestant and catholic corner and muhammad bringing up the rear for islam holding the hand of the nineyearold child he married we also have l ron hubbard scientology the cravatwearing author of buckskin brigades and our current pope who thinks men who kiss men are devilish he expounds this idea while dressed as father christmas spirituality you say congratulations boys on the greatest bullshit ever told what of women in religion we are followers not leaders we are the gilding on this mad lily everyone knows that nuns do what they are told and that they are terrible drivers i believe most women go to churchmosquesynagogue for something to do and for the nibbles its not the body of christ its a biscuit without men attendance at religious services would dramatically decline we would of course have nothing to pray for the environment this is a tricky one because women use hairdryers and hairdryers use electricity and i want to be fair im using a hairdryer now as i type my spleen but its been scientifically proven that cars and aeroplanes contribute more to global warming than hairdryers and curling tongs and who buys the magazines car and automobile and car and driver and aircraft and combat aircraft and hot rod you know who its m whats that strange noise its the imminent destruction of our shared habitat and we have no escape pods foxtons doesnt have a branch on pluto id laugh except im on fire i think this has to go down as another serious black mark for men psychiatry thank you dr freud and dr jung good work but i for one am still crying women also practise psychiatry its called empathy this is a good moment to posit the idea that in a manfree world makeup and beautyproduct sales would decline because we would have no one to preen for the fashion industry would die like an insect in autumn it is also possible that all women would be fat music it is a very true truism that men are good at music because they prefer it to speech but i have to say thank you for the teenageshagging elvis and the wifebeating frank because in a world without men i believe the music would be rubbish it would probably be like a suzanne vega concert love songs would disappear wed sing songs about crop rotation and vomiting babies and wed sit down at rock concerts literature written by the losers in life and therefore superb can women write as well as men well there is george eliot although she was not really called george she was really called mary ann cinema it would disappear we would talk instead ditto video games and that is my female planet i can feel you raving now i can smell your hate women are complicit in the madness you will say we fly in the planes and we eat the mouldy fruit salad we applaud the decapitations and read vogue too but men are the rulers of our planet the ambassadors of humanity you cannot dispute this and be truthful we women have never had the opportunity to fully express our own evil or our own goodness and so for absolute enlightenment to really make up my mind i turn to the bonobo thesis the bonobo is a type of ape it lives only in the congo and its one of our closest living relatives it lives in a matriarchal society there are blokes but the birds are in charge and it is more peaceful than the chimpanzee world they dont kill each other like chimps do they like french kissing and oral sex and they sleep in a nest so if we use the bonobo thesis it seems likely that a femaleonly planet would be more peaceful and more lecherous than our masculineled one but as i fantasise about this sweet new world the question pops up who would i have sex with i like women but i couldnt eat a whole one seriously though the paradise is cracking and crumbling and sundering around my unwashed ears in truth i would miss men i would miss their smell and their fragile sweetness and the way they look at match of the day in that lopsided manner like a lion ogling a chicken and i am certain that should the men all leave something terrible something even worse than all the terrible things they have already done would happen stay men stay,2009-07,awoke yesterday ira levins brain scientist used

in the forced marriage unit fmu dealt with cases up from in this increase can be attributed to a greater awareness of the issue as a result of campaigning and the governments sympathetic response in terms of protections offered to women and girls at risk through guidance to statutory agencies as well as the passing of the forced marriage civil protection act in the likelihood is that there are still a large number of forced marriages that go unreported the fmus comprehensive set of guidelines pdf which runs to pages to all frontline staff dealing with women and girls across a range of agencies such as social services health police and schools was published yesterday these guidelines are an updated amalgamation of different guidelines issued piecemeal to different agencies it is the culmination of many years of struggle by minority womens groups to get forced marriage recognised as a form of domestic violence so that all the protections afforded to victims of domestic violence would also be extended to those facing a forced marriage and girls running away from home would no longer be taken back by social services on the grounds that it was part of their culture to accept marriages arranged by their families in fact these attempts at mediation remained a stumbling block for a long time in official responses to forced marriage long after they had taken on board the fact that forced marriage was a violation of womens human rights groups such as southall black sisters which had a hand in drafting these guidelines argued very strongly that mediation endangered lives in no other domestic violence situation would agencies propose mediation the guidelines show a welcome though belated recognition of the dangers of mediation they warn against family conferences and the dangers of applying the principle that the best place for a young person is with their family these guidelines also represent an advance on previous documents as the fmu appears to have finally accepted that this is not a genderneutral issue for of cases affect women and girls it is in the implementation however that we get to see the real measure of it and no announcements have been made on what sort of inspection regime will be established implementation isnt just about good intentions but following the guidelines sensitively and judiciously for example there is a recommendation to doctors to be alert to such danger signals as a young woman being accompanied by her parents to the clinic on its own it might appear ridiculously interventionist taken together with the one chance rule that is that practitioners may only have one chance to speak to a potential victim and save a life could tip them over the edge into potentially racist assumptions doctors need to take the whole picture into account is she always accompanied are the relatives always doing the talking is she withdrawn and so on the central weakness of the guidelines however is that it focuses mainly on young women born and brought up in this country there is a significant minority of women from overseas who are forced into marriages with british men and subject to an immigration rule known as the two year rule if the woman leaves before the marriage has lasted two years she may have no recourse to public funds and therefore no access to refuges or any of the benefits available to other women in the same situation if the government is serious about protecting all women from violence then this differential must come to an end,2009-07,forced marriage unit fmu dealt case increase attributed greater

in a group of women set about smashing the nuclear family buoyed by the womens liberation movement they had become so enraged by the idea of mens work and womens work that in a spirit of correction they set up a commune here they explored new nonsexist ways of living they shared cooking laundry cleaning and childcare men were permitted but only on condition that they assuage their male guilt through housework they strove to eliminate patriarchal systems of oppression and the most radical was to subvert the blatantly phallocentric ritual of surnames we questioned why we would use the surname of the father recalls jo robinson commune pioneer then we thought why should it even be the mothers surname why cant the child have its own name so they came up with an arbitrary surname wild all the children born in the commune would bear the name wild the first wild commune was in a threestorey house in islington north london the idea soon spread to oxford then leeds hebden bridge and sheffield there were about loosely connected wild communities by by the mid to late s the wild movement had petered out their radical experiment obscured by the intervening decades except of course the women left a legacy the wild children live on so what does revolutionary feminism do to those conceived within it are they proud or disappointed by their pasts do they agree with their mothers dreams or do they find them hilarious al garthwaite and her daughter shelley wild a media producer and training director al lives in leeds shelley an re teacher was born in a commune there she is divorced with two children sophia six and william three and lives in lancashire when al garthwaite first heard of the wilds in she was a recent graduate of durham university living in oxford high on the idea of revolutionary politics and tribal systems of childrearing she had satin over the vietnam war dressed as a cow to help save a childrens playground and embraced the african saying it takes a whole village to raise a child this was in stark contrast to her own background the daughter of a brigadier general who went on to become treasurer of the local conservative party al had a privileged childhood going to boarding school but feeling isolated a lot of us felt very constrained growing up in the s which was a dismal and very conventional decade as a child she had felt her mothers frustration her only outlet was charity work and the churchyard flower committee she wasnt using a large part of her brain by al had moved to leeds where houses were cheaper to set up a commune with five adults two men three women loosely couples and two children we all looked after the children they didnt have a primary relationship with their mother nonbiological parents were as equally important as biological parents al acted as a mother to maya wild and cass wild before having her own daughter everyone had their own bedroom but the kitchen and sitting room were communal and the children shared a room with bunkbeds we started a creche and two of us would take it in turns to look after what became four children by the time shelley was born in al had come out as a lesbian her sexuality she says is a determined political stance and the commune was womenonly shelley was looked after by four mothers her father was an old friend then not involved but whom shelley now sees quite a bit shelley remembers reclaim the night and women against violence against women posters lentils market vegetables and lots of attention i had four people interested in my wellbeing reading bedtime stories taking me swimming it meant the adults who were looking after us were fresh and not tired she called all the women by their christian names including al i see all my mums to this day apart from rose because she died last year it was she concludes fantastically positive with no resentment of her mothers attachment to those who werent her real children but defence she admits is her default position because we were called wild people assumed we were feral and rampant barefoot in the street with no adult supervision in fact if anything it was the opposite we were given so much attention wild was simply to do with freedom to be who we wanted to be when shelley was five the commune split up partly because the house was a frequent focus of attacks it would be dog poo on the door handle eggs on the window and abuse as we walked down the street remembers shelley al moved with shelley to a different part of leeds but continued to subvert traditional models of family life by keeping an open house for various children including maya wild and lesbian lodgers but shelley rebelled she switched from womens studies to religious studies at lancaster university she wore highheels short skirts and went out with men i just wanted to fit in she says i was rebelling against al id had enough i was fed up with everything being political and then there were the clothes oh god she used to wear this horrible thing like a babygrow in shelley married a torysupporting civil servant al came to the wedding and as mother of the bride spoke apparently she had this massive speech a feminist rant actually but two of my mums got to it first and crossed out loads last summer the couple separated i should never have married a tory she says now a mother of two shelley is starting to look back with more than fond nostalgia as a single parent now i can see how fantastic it would be to have all that support youre not stuck with them day in day out getting bored or frazzled youve got a break and space and so really enjoy their company today she is close to her mother who only lives an hour away als marvellous shes got a phd and still does work in the community she just does so much but in the spirit of rebellion shelley still wears highheels al for her part has some regrets i think we were unrealistic about thinking that five adults living in a house would go on living in the house for ever she continues but relationships have endured shelley is my only biological child but she and cass and maya always look out for each other and if i become infirm and need care shes not going to be on her own thinking im the only child plus age has softened her having been scornful of the word mum she is very happy to be known as grandma as for wild shelley dropped it when she got married but plans to reinstate it when the divorce is finalised its my identity she says jo robinson and her son sam sky wild a gardener midwife and teacher jo lives in walthamstow london her son sam a journalist was born in a wild commune in islington he is single and lives in hong kong jo robinson was a notorious figure on the feminist circuit in the early s she wore motorbike leathers and rode a honda at a protest against the miss world competition at the royal albert hall in she sprayed a bouncer with blue ink from a water pistol that protest completely changed our lives she recalls i had a direct feeling of contact with years of patriarchy and repression after that i just questioned the whole thing of what women should do her early experience of family life was not good her father a butcher and her mother a housewife shared the same house in blackpool but communicated via notes such as the coalman is coming today can you leave me some money it was stifling she says an only child living with two grownups who didnt get on life outside the family was more exciting they should have separated she says but the divorce reform act making it easier to escape marriage didnt come into effect until people like my parents couldnt divorce she says it was horrible and expensive so lots of people stayed together she moved to london aged after art college in blackpool at first it was a struggle and i had a nervous breakdown and life was very dark then she was introduced to politics by a group of people she met while working for a theatre designing posters theyd just come back from france and had taken part in the student may protest she explains everyone was just full of the idea of revolution shortly after she swept into the womens liberation movement and soon found herself pregnant and living with friends in islington north london one other woman had recently had a baby and they both came up with the wild idea they didnt for a minute expect it to be copied she says there were adults living in the house and three children plus a creche used by other children living off benefits trusts and parents there was a rota for cooking childcare and washing i have great memories of constantly being in the company of kids who were akin to being brothers and sisters says her son sam who lived in the commune with jo and her partner until he was five his father always lived nearby and they shared the childcare a group then moved east to hackney where they separated into different houses sam and jo lived with a few others but continued to share food and the children moved between homes we were a series of satellites spinning around each other says sam with something common at the core but from his early teens sam was an uncooperative participant in the communal programme i had jeans with an embroidered rainbow on the back pocket now that would be brilliant then it marked me out as different sam wanted cream wrangler cords and adidas trainers he wanted to watch the professionals they didnt want me watching those macho guys running around with guns shooting people friends would sneer at his name on the housework rota frown at the missing bannisters and lentil stews i certainly kept my parents and their lifestyle at arms length he dreamed of being a banker and prowled around dodgy housing estates in a bored feral way there were times when i used to resent my parents for being different why couldnt they be normal so that was the downside it lacked stability however it wasnt all rebellion he went on to belfast university to read politics and is now a journalist he is constitutionally incapable of settling down of course there were elements of it that were naive and overly ideological but fundamentally what they were seeking to achieve had a good heart jo went on to become a midwife and then a teacher retiring two years ago to become a gardener she hasnt lived in a commune for years but age hasnt diminished her political activism she recently joined the tamil protest in parliament square i feel most proud of the way we challenged the way houses are formed partnerships are formed and the way children are brought up she says today were used to the nuclear family breaking up then it was a challenging notion instead of being a very passive person who had had a nervous breakdown i saw i had something to give me now

i would have started writing this earlier but i had to go and stare at some socks such innocent rather mundane objects how can it be that once again they are key to a feminist debate fay weldon old feminist exfeminist a woman with a new novel to promote however she cares to define herself has opined its such a waste of time trying to tell your husband to pick up the socks or clean the loo its much easier just to do it yourself quite fay quite as for feminism the author of the life and loves of a shedevil feels that her contemporaries usually come around to my way of thinking im probably the only one the only feminist there is only feminist there is her way of thinking well aint the little lady getting uppity indeed shut that yammering hole woman shouldnt you be sorting out some socks in some ways its stupid to react it has been difficult to take weldon seriously since she described rape as not the worst thing that can happen to a woman if i recall correctly at the time she even supplied a delightful anecdote about some rapelite fumble shed once had in the back of a cab her tone almost being dont worry ladies get your own back at dinner by choosing the lobster however its on her alltime favourite topic of how modern women should stop being so hard on men undermining them despising them being mean to them that weldon shows her true colours indeed maybe its time to ask what is it with older women whove lived their own lives how they wanted to in an essentially feministdefined fashion enjoying the kudos and the spoils suddenly turning around and telling younger women to shut up and put up clean the loo pick the socks up stop being so mean what is it with the surrendered feminists surrendered feminists are like the surrendered wives only creepier women like weldon ride the feminist wave for all its worth then suddenly inexplicably sometime in late middle age go all gooey and protective over the boys i once interviewed doris lessing and otherwise sage fierce and brilliant go doris she was coming out with this modern women are too hard on men guff too despite having herself fled early on from a life of soulsapping domestic drudgery lessing reminded me that both she and weldon had sons a good point but it only flies so far of course mothers want sons to be happy but presumably daughters too this is what the likes of weldon forget as they trill about how much happier men would be if they had their coffee stirred socks balled lavatories scrubbed enjoying being pampered is not a man thing its a human thing so never mind the guys whos going to pick the girls socks up clean their loos what was that fay nobody id really like to know how do men feel about this do they enjoy weldons thesis that theyre such simple creatures you can keep them happy by sorting their smalls actually maybe i wouldnt like to know indeed it would be funny if it werent so tragic here are we embroiled in a gender debate but not about love art work death destiny whatever but the crucial matter of socks perhaps weldon and other purveyors of surrendered feminist claptrap should take on board that there are women out there probably just like their younger selves who dont fancy the idea that their worth their identity even the way they show love should be defined by domestic chores that like me women have had a good hard look at socks and come to the conclusion that theyre not that sodding interesting unless men start picking ours up now that would be news oasis put rock music back to where it belonged in the gutter can it be true has noel gallagher really walked and oasis split how can people tell with other bands arguments cancelled shows and smashed guitars would be all the evidence required but the gallagher brothers have always been like this from the start their relationship had an old testament pulse cain and abel with soundchecks one even marvelled at how noel could fit in a successful songwriting career around his day job of trying to kill liam if oasis have split its sad and not only because latterly theyd succumbed to the cliched rock star manner of conveying anger and contempt the travelled in separate tour buses how very fleetwood mac what next boys refusing to share the toblerone and little jar of peanuts from the hotel minibar however an oasis split is sadder than that love them or hate them they were culturally important not only for the songs but because they took popular music back where it belonged to the working class they helped stem the everincreasing tide of dreary posh boys with alevels in music theory and selfentitlement writing whiny bitter boostrumhoo songs about girls who didnt fancy them oasis did more than most to return british rock to the sexy strutting gobby gutter where it belongs to paraphrase oscar wilde all the better to look at the stars so when weve stopped rolling our eyes perhaps we should hope its not truly the end come on guys give each other a manhug that cain and abel thing is so bc binge drinkers arent the problem its stealth drinkers one thing you cant fault katie price for is her alcoholic honesty for the uncrowned high priestess of bingedrink britain it takes by her own admission only a sniff of the barmaids apron for her to start sliding down the wall resembling a bad xena warrior princess inflatable as a semiretired binge drinker i can say with some authority that this is the truth of binge drinking not drinking regularly it takes surprisingly little for us to become less than fragrant and being sociable creatures this tends to occur in full public view then we wake up with a hangover that feels like a dress rehearsal for senility and a couple more of our smother me now anecdotes in short were idiots but were open about it we laugh at ourselves and heres the clincher were fun in fact give or take a couple of soggy livers bds are arguably the best kind of drinkers if you dont believe me look at the competition i happen to know some very nice nondrinkers but science is science a study from a norwegian university assessed the physical and mental health of nearly norwegians and concluded that teetotallers have significantly higher levels of depression and fewer social skills and friends than people who enjoy the odd drink so thats nondrinkers for you miserable socially inept billy no mates always a cranberry snapple away from abject desolation who knew not only that another study pinpoints not binge drinkers but the middleaged middle class as the heaviest drinkers in britain they drink regularly as much as five times a week seemingly unaware of the increased strength of modern wine did you hear that middle class youre trashed moreover they drink by stealth presumably this means in front rooms or under patio heaters from dusty glasses hating their lives and their partners like some longlost philip larkin poem about middle england existential despair they fuck you up those oddbins threeforone deals these people probably pride themselves on being a cut above common binge drinkers but such depressing activity surely merits its own damning label dingy drinking cringe drinking whatever its enough to know that

the binge drinkers will grow up to be wives and mothers if you see enough pictures of young girls drinking outside pubs and falling over you decide young women are all like that and despise them but theyre all right and they will be all right i find the phrase organised criminals comforting when i hear it i thank god somebody somewhere knows what theyre doing and has a plan i never said rape was good i said once that it was better than being killed or being raped and then killed id rather be raped than killed if both things are going to happen to you well thats really bad having been raped and having had my children ill and in mortal danger well the latter is worse rape is awful but it is not the worst awfulness and to suggest that it is is probably socially unhelpful you end up with a woman in angola who is thrown out of society because shes somehow polluted i shouldve said exactly this and defended myself properly at the time the backlash was hurtful i phoned germaine greer who was wonderful she said oh its only a penis for gods sake no amount of sex education is going to help a young person not get pregnant it just makes them feel even more sexy and now girls have the state for fathers why are we surprised i was accused of defiling the novel the deal was that i must mention bulgari times in a novel i wrote for them as a giveaway my agent was terribly good and knocked them down to nine and a half mentions in the end i mentioned them times they refused to publish me in sweden after bulgari but my husband still drives a saab theres an incredible extraordinary dependency on physical appearance its the great diversion from the fact that the asteroid and swine flu are about to strike people would really far rather not read any of that stuff but look at someone in a bikini i love being retouched in photographs i absolutely encourage it one sort of believes in recycling but one believes in it as a kind of palliative to the gods i like sex ive had feedback but men will feed you back anything wont they what you look like never seemed to matter i went through my early years buttoned up to the neck but then i found myself on a bar stool with not many clothes on when i worked as a hostess men instantly clustered around but then you attract men you dont necessarily want to keep around you have to have a man to survive culturally weve reached a stage where women feel the same as they did years ago truly miserable without one vibrators are nothing compared to men sex is more than an orgasm if any woman says to me i dont need a man ive got a vibrator i think well what sort of life have you had its a myth that i thought up the slogan go to work on an egg it was one of those late nights when the clients rejected everything and youre the copy chief and desperate i flicked through some stuff from and spotted it go to work on an egg so we put that up at the top it didnt sell any more eggs of course but everyone remembers it i cant

when the new york times one of the most powerful newspapers in the western world highlights women in the developing world as key agents of ending world poverty it is a revolution fourteen years ago in beijing the new york times journalists covering the un conference on women said openly that they had been told to cover hillary clinton and not bother with the conference issues but that was then and this is now with the times giving a lesson in how the media can change agendas when it decides to the new york times writers of these articles are mainly men with prizewinning war correspondent dexter filkins reporting on a girls school in afghanistan and one of the papers bestknown and most prolific columnists nicholas kristof ranging across africa and asia it has been decades since everyone in the aid world knew that research showed how improving womens education led to better health for their families and communities which led in turn to economic possibilities and theoretically to the growth of societies which would demand better governments the nobel prizewinning economist amartya sens famous dictum that no famine has ever taken place in the history of the world in a functioning democracy can be seen as a buttress for this argument educated women resist ignorant dictators who impoverish their countries but the change in womens lot never came as so many of us thought it would because women were not a priority neither in their own societies nor in ours however there are now changes in the most unlikely places invisible to most outsiders and the new york times has given us a glimpse of what is there to build on in recent years kristof has been the most consistent hardhitting reporter on the worst of womens fates in societies where they are considered secondclass citizens and on the women who have fought back sex trafficking brothels full of homesick young girls mass rape needless deaths in childbirth forced marriage and untreated fistula are among the subjects he has forced onto his papers oped page and filled pages of blog posts with kristof and his wife sheryl wudunn who have a book out next month half the sky turning oppression into opportunity for women worldwide say the st century has one paramount moral challenge as slavery was for the th century and it is the brutality inflicted on women and girls in so many countries around the world was hillary clinton attempting to rise to this challenge this month when on her lightening trip to seven african countries she took the time to visit and listen to the women of eastern democratic republic of congo where an estimated women and girls have been raped in the wars of the last years that have destroyed their society for most of that time anneke van woudenberg has been the most meticulous researcher into these horrors for human rights watch and a tireless advocate for the women in another sign of todays changed attitudes to this subject van woudenbergs work has come right into the us intellectual mainstream with an excellent article in the current new york review of books by another powerful male writer the distinguished historian of the congo adam hochschild the thesis behind this great spread of new york times articles is that from afghanistan to zimbabwe things are finally beginning to change for women in myriad ways in part because exceptional women in developing countries are making change and partly because other women such as the wellendowed who are part of the usbased womens funding network are targeting giving to women notably for education it will take a lot more than the new york times muscle to force kristofs moral challenge of the st century onto mainstream agendas to stay but clinton for one has a chance to focus her power on it and for all the

and so it transpires that it is not as i have mistakenly presumed for the past years about equal pay or miss world or domestic violence or lapdancing or childcare or dungarees uhuh feminism isnt even about sex its about socks and specifically the picking up thereof of course im being mischievous as i suspect fay weldon was being when the daily telegraph dispatched their token youngfairandfemale columnist bryony gordon who attests to finding feminism dreary to interview the yearold about her latest novel during their conversation weldon bounces from the governments attitude to ham to the social benefits of teenage pregnancy instructing how to pick a man must be semigoodlooking and ablebodied get a man dont go to bed with him easily and keep a man dont let him know if youre cleverer than he is as for socks there are women at work and theres mating behaviour and women get them confused at work gender should not come into it women are right to refuse to make the coffee but when you get home im afraid you have to make the coffee its such a waste of time trying to tell your husband to pick up the socks or clean the loo its much easier just to do it yourself oh fay first there was the time she announced that rape isnt the worst thing that can happen to a woman and called for the charge to be reduced to one of aggravated assault then there was her effort what makes women happy which included the instruction to ladies to stop taking frequency of orgasm as the measure of good sex it would appear that weldon decided when she grew old not only to wear purple and eat butter by the pound but to throw out verbal grenades at regular but random intervals to irritate and alienate as many folk as possible these latest remarks for example are galling not only because they recommend a bloodless rulesoriented approach to straight relationships but because they assume all men to be helpless hopeless dolts easily flummoxed by a wily female adopting a bloodless rulesoriented approach to relationships but i only intend to be needled for a moment i take weldon very seriously as the writer of praxis puffball and life and loves of a shedevil but as a sage on contemporary gender issues not so much nor am i convinced that she intends to be taken entirely seriously herself to paraphrase wonderlands duchess she only does it to annoy because she knows it teases but theres a semiserious point to be made here whenever weldon enjoys an episode of interlocutary incontinence her words are leapt upon by parts of the press doubtless partially quoted at the easily offended and thus presented as yet another example of feminists fighting like cats in a bag yet i very much doubt that our fay considers herself a feminist these days if she ever did given the frequency with which she dismisses the theory as boring and the practice selfdefeating and fair dos i have no intention of forcing her to come to a party she doesnt like the sound of just as id never eject anybody because i didnt like the sound of them though lord knows ive been tempted but when the media only ever shows interest in handbags at dawn while a woman who attacks feminism is bizarrely labelled feminist as a debate trope it draws energy away from those really essential conversations we need to be having now more than ever and thats heaps more troubling than the distracting

men are responsible for most cases of domestic violence but women are three times more likely to be arrested for incidents of abuse research reveals today a report into domestic abuse and gender by bristol university found that the majority of cases involved alcohol misuse that women were more likely to use a weapon to protect themselves and that children were present in the majority of cases previous research has shown that the vast majority of domestic violence perpetrators recorded by the police are men and their victims mainly female with many more repeat incidents recorded for male than female perpetrators while the majority of incidents of domestic violence recorded by the police involve maletofemale abuse little is known about the nature of incidents where men are recorded as victims and women as perpetrators nor about the circumstances where both partners are recorded as perpetrators the new study by professor marianne hester of the university of bristols school for policy studies and carried out on behalf of the northern rock foundation looked at examples from perpetrator profiles tracked from to the research looked at cases where women were the aggressors where men were in that role and where it was both partners it found that of the cases were related to couples still in a relationship involved violence after separation and the rest involved couples in the process of splitting up some of men had at least two incidents recorded one man had in contrast of women recorded as perpetrators had only one incident recorded and the highest number of repeat incidents for any woman was eight men were significantly more likely than women to use physical violence threats and harassment and to damage the womens property women were more likely to damage their own mens violence tended to create a context of fear and control the researchers said whereas women were more likely to use verbal abuse or some physical violence but women were more likely to use a weapon although this was often to stop further violence from their partners all cases with seven or more incidents most of which involved men led to arrest but in general women were three times more likely to be arrested during the sixyear period men were arrested once in every incidents and women arrested once in every three issues of divorce and child contact were common in dual perpetrator cases and also included the greatest number of instances where both partners were heavy drinkers children were present in of cases when the violence or other abuse took place in cases involving postseparation violence problems of child contact were cited in of cases hester said both men and women can be violent but there are significant differences in the way men and women use violence and abuse against their partners and also the impact of such behaviour this needs to be taken into account if we want to ensure greater safety for individuals the research has crucial lessons for the criminal justice system in this respect,2009-08,men responsible case domestic violence woman three time likely arrested incident abuse research reveals today report domestic abuse gender bristol

despite feminists reputation and contra my own individual reputation cultivated over five years of public opinionmaking as a blogger i am not a manhater if i played by misogynists rules specifically the one that dictates it only takes one woman doing one mean or duplicitous or disrespectful or unlawful or otherwise bad thing to justify hatred of all women i would have plenty of justification for hating men if i were inclined to do that sort of thing most of my threatening hate mail comes from men the most unrelentingly troublemaking trolls at my blog shakesville have always been men ive been catcalled and cowcalled from moving vehicles countless times subjected to other forms of street harassment and sexually harassed at work always by men i have been sexually assaulted if one includes rape attempted rape unsolicited touching of breasts buttocks andor genitals nonconsensual frottage on public transportation and flashing by dozens of people during my lifetime some known to me some strangers all men but i dont hate men because i play by different rules in fact there are men in this world whom i love quite a lot there are also individual men in this world i would say i probably hate or something close men who i hold in unfathomable contempt but it is not because they are men no i dont hate men it would however be fair to say that i dont easily trust them my mistrust is not as one might expect primarily a result of the violent acts done on my body nor the vicious humiliations done to my dignity it is instead born of the multitude of mundane betrayals that mark my every relationship with a man the casual rape joke the use of a female slur the careless demonising of the feminine in everyday conversation the accusations of overreaction the eye rolling and exasperated sighs in response to polite requests to please not use misogynist epithets in my presence or to please use nongendered language humankind there are the insidious assumptions guiding our interactions the supposition that i will regard being exceptionalised as a compliment youre not like those other women and the presumption that i am an ally against certain kinds of women surely were all in agreement that britney spears is a dirty slut who deserves nothing but a steady stream of misogynist vitriol whenever her name is mentioned right always the subtle pressure to abandon my principles to trash this woman or that woman as if ill never twig to the reality that theres always a justification for unleashing the misogyny for hating a woman in ways reserved only for women i am exhorted to join in the cruel revelry and when i refuse suddenly the target is on my back and so it goes there are the jokes about women about wives about mothers about raising daughters about female bosses they are told in my presence by men who are meant to care about me just to get a rise out of me as though i am meant to find funny a reminder of my secondclass status i am meant to ignore that this is a bullying tactic that the men telling these jokes derive their amusement specifically from knowing they upset me piss me off hurt me they tell them and i can laugh and they can thus feel superior or i can not laugh and they can thus feel superior heads they win tails i lose i am used as a prop in an ongoing game of patriarchal posturing and then i am meant to believe it is true when some of the men who enjoy this sport in which i am their pawn tell me i love you i love you my daughter i love you my niece i love you my friend i am meant to trust these words there are the occasions that men intellectual men clever men engaged men insist on playing devils advocate desirous of a debate on some aspect of feminist theory or reproductive rights or some other subject generally filed under the heading womens issues these intellectual clever engaged men want to endlessly probe my argument for weaknesses wrestle over details argue just for fun and they wonder these intellectual clever engaged men why my voice keeps rising and why my face is flushed and why after an hour of fighting my corner hot tears burn the corners of my eyes why do you have to take this stuff so personally ask the intellectual clever and engaged men who have never considered that the content of the abstract exercise thats so much fun for them is the stuff of my life there is the perplexity at my fury that my life experience is not considered more relevant than the opinionated pronouncements of men who make a pastime of informal observation as if womanhood were an exotic locale which provides magnificent fodder for the amateur ethnographer and there is the haughty dismissal of my assertion that being on the outside looking in doesnt make one more objective it merely provides a different perspective there are the persistent tiresome pronouncements of similitude between mens and womens experiences the belligerent insistence that handsome men are objectified by women too that women pinch mens butts sometimes too that men are expected to look a certain way at work too that women rape too and other equivalencies that conveniently and stupidly ignore institutional inequities that mean x rarely equals y and there are the longsuffering groans that meet any attempt to contextualise sexism and refute the idea that such indignities grim though they all may be are not necessarily equally oppressive there are the stereotypes oh the abundant stereotypes about women not me of course but other women those women with their bad driving and their relentless shopping habits and their pms and their disgusting vanity and their inability to stop talking and their disinterest in important things and their trying to trap men and their getting pregnant on purpose and their false rape accusations and their being bitches sluts whores cunts and i am expected to nod in agreement and i am nudged and admonished to agree i am expected to say these things are not true of me but are true of women am i seceding from the union i am expected to put my stamp of token approval on the stereotypes yes its true between you and me its all true thats what is wanted from me abdication of my principles and pride in service to a patriarchal system that will only use my collusion to further subjugate me this is a thing that is asked of me by men who purport to care for me there is the unwillingness to listen a ferociously stubborn not getting it on so many things so many important things and the obdurate refusal to believe to internalise that my outrage is not manufactured and my injury not makebelieve an inflexible rejection of the possibility that my pain is authentic in favour of the consolatory belief that i am angry because im a feminist rather than the truth that im a feminist because im angry and there is the denial about engaging in misogyny even when its evident even when its pointed out gently softly indulgently carefully with goodwill and the presumption that it was not intentional there is the firm fixed unyielding denial because it is better and easier to imply that im stupid or crazy or hysterical that i have imagined being insulted by someone about whom i care just for the fun of it than it is to just admit a bloody mistake and say simply im sorry not every man does all of these things or even most of them and certainly not all the time but it only takes one randomly and occasionally exploding in a shower of cartoon stars like an unexpected punch in the nose to send me staggering sideways wondering what just happened well i certainly didnt see that coming these things are not the habits of deliberately cruel men they are in fact the habits of the men in this world i love quite a lot all of whom have given me reason to mistrust them to use my distrust as a selfprotection mechanism as an essential tool to get through every day because i never know when i might next get knocked offkilter with something that puts me in the position once again of choosing between my dignity and the serenity of our relationship it can come out of nowhere and usually does which leaves me mistrustful by both necessity and design not fearful just resigned and on my guard more vulnerability than that allows for the possibility of wounds that do not heal wounds to our relationship the sort of irreparable damage that leaves one unable to look in the eye someone that you loved once upon a time this then is the terrible bargain we have regretfully struck men are allowed the easy comfort of their unexamined privilege but my regard will always be shot through with a steely anxious bolt of caution a shitty bargain all around really but there it is there are men who will read this post and think huffily dismissively that a person of colour could write a post very much like this one about white people about me thats absolutely right so could a lesbian a gay man a bisexual an asexual so could a trans or intersex person which hardly makes a comprehensive list im ok with that i dont feel hated i feel mistrusted and i understand it i respect it it means for me i must be vigilant and make myself trustworthy every day i hope those men will hear me when i say again i do not hate you i mistrust you you can tell yourselves thats a problem with me some inherent flaw some evidence that i am fucked up and broken and weird you can choose to believe that the women in your lives are nothing like me or you can be vigilant and make yourselves trustworthy every day just in case theyre more like me than you think postscript this piece was originally published at shakesville on august in the interceding days it has been widely linked and extensively discussed and has spawned dozens of posts by other writers on intersectional topics such as transphobia fat hatred disablism and racism among others it has also been uncommonly quoted and rather than one good line or passage being repeatedly singled out as is typical nearly every part of this piece has been excerpted somewhere each paragraph meaningful to different people for different reasons countless individual experiences rarely shared seldom discussed at the request of readers who wanted this conversation to be ongoing weve had three followup threads at shakesville so far and ive received an enormous amount of email in response the vast majority of it from women thanking me for writing it and sharing with me the sometimes funny sometimes infuriating and sometimes genuinely tragic details of their own terrible bargains struck with partners fathers brothers friends bosses ive also received emails from men most of it also grateful and complimentary though some of it critical and most of that from readers who fundamentally misunderstood that i was writing about men who are important to me thats not of course an incidental fact it is the centrepiece of the essay which i wrote in response to a need that took its shape in the comment threads of shakesville and in my conversations with female friends formed by frequent references sometimes oblique and slightly embarrassed sometimes blunt and angry to womens upsetting interactions with the men in their lives about whom they care the subject is one of the most popular themes of emails i get from women im paying more attention to the things my male partnerfatherbrothermale best friend says and im challenging him more and i am scared that if i said everything i wanted to say our relationship would explode into a million pieces it is a discussion that feminist women talk around a lot but never quite have in detail that men we love express misogyny and that it is alienating functionally undermining the intimacy of the relationship and sometimes the entire relationship itself its so much easier to talk about misogyny emanating from men who dont care about us and about whom we dont care this is a much more difficult subject one i had been trying to find a way to broach in a meaningful way for awhile to miss the point that its not about men but about individual and specific men with whom individual and specific women have individual and specific relationships is to miss the point entirely its not about misogyny but about how misogyny functions in intimate and familiar relationships in wanted relationships or as the case may be in unwanted but nonetheless existing relationships from which extricating oneself is difficult complicated or biologically impossible and in some cases imminent women have told me stories of showing the piece to a partner only to have him react in a way that confirmed their worst fears i have been asked how my husband reacted to the piece he reacted by proudly tweeting it emailing me to tell me he loved it and pointing to the places in which he saw himself things hes done things weve talked about its not like weve never argued or that ive never had to explain where im coming from but the thing hes always had going for him is that he doesnt want to hurt me a sentiment i return naturally and so hes been willing to hear me out when i say what youre doing is hurting me if he hadnt been our relationship wouldnt exist if i couldnt say this behaviour hurts me and have that matter i couldnt feel safe if i cant trust you to care when i tell you youve hurt me how can i trust you at all thats the terror underlying this terrible bargain the secret we dont speak or didnt until i made a little noise and a cacophony of voices rose,2009-08,despite feminist reputation contra individual reputation cultivated five year public opinionmaking

in my mothers bare breasts got her into the sun though not in the way you might think roughly of the same generation as germaine greer she is a feminist albeit one whose wavemaking was on a more modest scale in fact we were both in the paper her decision to feed me as baby while teaching at a girls school was not in her eyes a radical act of defiance it was simply common sense yet when it comes to the position of women common sense was then as now in short supply breastfeeding in public still ludicrously causes a fuss watching trilogy a play now in its last week at the edinburgh festival and billed as a celebratory venture into modernday feminism i was reminded that my generation needs feminism just as much as our mothers did with performances culminating in audience members joyfully singing jerusalem naked on stage nic greens remarkable show is rightly the talk of the town many though seem to be discomfited by its second segment based on the landmark debate on womens liberation in new york a blustering affair featuring greer and chaired bizarrely by that archmisogynist norman mailer i imagine it was this footage including the high jinks of jill johnston the village voice writer rolling around onstage with girlfriends that afterwards prompted a woman my age to say arent we past all that the answer ringing in my head more loudly than ever after watching green and co is no we may be past all that if the that is being able to shave our armpits and wear sexy shoes without fear of betraying the sisterhood we are not however beyond the need for feminism like green im a woman in my twenties and though my mother probably suffered more sexism than i will women and men of my age must carry on where our mothers left off weve come a long way the distance we feel from the entrenched sexism of sixties america for example is largely what makes mad men such compelling viewing yet theres just as far left to go from the bothersome ageist double standards of tv executives to the simply horrifying more than one in four believe that a woman is totally or partially responsible for being raped if she is wearing sexy or revealing clothing to the comments last week from gosports conservative associations chairman that hed only select a female mp if they were attractive were deeply mistaken to think of this as a postfeminism era when i was five and watching pmqs no doubt waiting for sesame street to come on rather than displaying political precocity i apparently asked why everyone on tv was a man nineteen years on i could ask the same question britain has just three full cabinet ministers who are women only of mps are female can anyone seriously believe these figures are dictated by merit women still do not have the equal opportunity to play an equal part in society my generation needs to embrace the sort of feminism that has nothing to do with manbashing and everything to do with greens goodhumoured and simultaneously deeply serious outlook it bothers me greatly that we arent all calling ourselves feminists as television presenter lauren laverne asked last week how stupid do you have to be to say i believe in gender inequality more

abusive partners could face restraining orders even if they are acquitted of assault under new powers to be introduced next month enhanced legal protections for victims of domestic violence will come into effect on september making it easier for courts to grant injunctions against abusive partners previously judges in criminal cases could only impose nonmolestation orders for example if defendants had been convicted of either harassment or putting someone in fear of violence the change belatedly implementing legislation passed five years ago was today welcomed by womens aid charities and refuges breaking the terms of an order can lead to a jail term of up to five years a home office spokesman said courts will be given greater powers to impose restraining orders on husbands who beat their wives from next month abusers accused of any criminal offence could find themselves hit with a court injunction judges will even be able to impose an order if the defendant is acquitted at the moment only those convicted of two distinct offences harassment or putting someone in fear of violence can be hit with an order unless victims take a separate civil action according to the home office domestic violence accounts for of all violent incidents and involves more repeat victims than any other crime repeat victimisation accounts for of all incidents of domestic violence of victims have been victimised three or more times home office minister lord west said domestic violence is a devastating crime which impacts across all communities the additional powers will help victims in need of immediate protection and spare them the need to take separate civil action womens charities insisted the powers to impose orders on those acquitted of domestic violence did not represent a significant breach of human rights pointing out that nonmolestation orders can already be granted in civil proceedings before the final hearings nicola harwin chief executive of womens aid said we must improve protection for those affected by abuse these restraining orders will provide a valuable new tool to help protect victims evidence shows that although many young people will not tolerate domestic violence up to a million girls and boys in the uk are at risk every year sandra horley chief executive of refuge a charity that helps women and children who have experienced domestic violence said we are pleased that five years after the domestic violence crime and victims act was passed the government is going to give the criminal courts greater freedom to grant restraining orders when violent partners are prosecuted abused women will now be able to obtain protection without having to go to a separate court or to find the funding to pay for civil orders the restraining orders can be put in place for an indefinite period of time if necessary providing ongoing protection however refuge is still concerned that this initiative will only be as good as the people who are enforcing it so often court orders are not recorded on police computers and breaches of orders are not always taken seriously the new restraining orders can only be issued by the courts when a violent partner is convicted or acquitted the police can impose bail conditions at the time of arrest but bail conditions are often breached and not rigorously enforced thereby leaving a woman vulnerable in the time leading up to trial there are numerous examples of men who have breached such bail conditions with impunity and have been left free to murder their partners refuge would like to see bail conditions such as a noncontact condition pending trial much more rigorously enforced every week two women are killed by a current or former partner and women commit suicide to escape domestic abuse,2009-08,abusive

a spectre is haunting britains supermarkets the spectre of lesbianism following concerns about the word lesbian tesco and other major retailers are stocking versions of the film lesbian vampire killers with stickers that obscure the word lesbian and part of the image of a cleavage that appear on the sleeve strange that allegra mcevedy and sue perkins might not look quite like your average lady tv presenters but id hardly consider them scarier than vampires and killers not content with covering the frightful lword some versions of the censored dvd carry another sticker which states warning may display sexually suggestive cover image another sticker that only partially obscures the cleavage says warning contains explicitly fit bloodsucking hotties clearly sexism is considered acceptable in these family environments tesco sainsburys asda and borders are among the stores that have chosen to stock the censored cover but no one is owning up to having requested the wording to be obscured a spokesperson from sainsburys admitted that it did have a policy of censoring some magazine covers but hmv is the only one major store to stock the dvd au naturel this storm in a sapphic dcup comes as no great surprise over the years diva has encountered a peculiarly negative reaction to the word lesbian from certain major retail outlets asked for shelf talkers the publicity strips that run along news stand shelving some suggestions incorporating the dreaded lword have been rejected whenever we print our annual sex issue one magazine specialist requests we submit the cover image for approval in short supermarkets and other family stores or brands such as amazon are afraid of the lword its been a while since radclyffe halls novel the well of loneliness was banned for obscenity and every copy destroyed i would rather give a healthy boy or healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel an editorial in the sunday express declaimed stories involving lesbians may leap a little higher in the headlines than comparable cases involving heterosexuals might do but there are some who still believe that lesbianism should be policed when touting for advertising certain agencies have said no thanks were a family brand there is another side to this story of course anyone whos wasted the full minutes required to watch director phil claydons saucy epic will know that its heterosexist fantasies of buxom faux sapphic lovelies are specious and degrading to men and women alike i dont believe that grown men actually want to see this stuff any more than women regardless of sexuality sex and sexuality are nefarious subjects in popular culture what is considered too sexual or obscene is subjective and a onerulefitsall approach isnt helpful for example although i consider divas annual sex issue covers show respectful nudity that is not degrading to women others may disagree one of the reasons we print a sex issue is because we believe its important for lesbians to see their sexuality depicted in an attractive positive informative and healthy way every womens magazine runs sex features about heterosexual sex and diva does the same for its lesbian and bisexual readers unfortunately for us the censorious scandal that emerged from the reaction to halls chaste representation of lesbianism persists today albeit in different scanty clothing cheesy sexist dross like claytons movie that portray lesbianism in a sleazy manner add to the nervous reaction to certain types of lesbian imagery what to do challenge sexism and lesbophobia wherever it

for anyone who thought the backlash against feminism was predicated on nothing more than the fevered imaginings of bitter manhating old harridans the past few weeks must have been quite an eyeopener from the mainstream medias desperate attempts to convince its audience that feminists dont even exist to calls for harriet harman and hillary clinton to shut the fuck up and stop being uppity the attack on both feminism and feminists this summer has been relentless while the victorians may have thought children should be seen and not heard its clear that many in our socalled modern and progressive stcentury western society would much prefer it if women would slink off to the nursery or better still the attic to be called on to speak only when theyre prepared to toe the line the existence in our national parliaments of female politicians may be held up by some as evidence that the last great bastions of male privilege have been breached and gender equality accomplished but let any one of those stateswomen talk out of turn and shell be slapped back down again faster than you can say female window dressing this antipathy to women in public office is nothing new of course susan faludi and others have been documenting it since the late s and early s and experienced public figures as they are im sure both harman and clinton are now used to finding themselves on the receiving end of misogynists ire so the recent onslaught wont have held any great surprises for them or indeed for any feminist whos been around for a while well apart from the levels of vitriol now being employed and the ramping up of the hateful rhetoric such successful women are now expected to endure rod liddles pathetic hissy fit and dana milbanks sketch about obamas beer summit where he suggested clinton should drink mad bitch beer have been the tip of the iceberg in a summer that has seen both women subjected to the most execrable abuse laurie penny has expressed the endearingly naive view that harman should simply take some tips from the younger generation about her presentation and oratory style to avoid invoking the wrath of white men everywhere but the only lesson to be learned from the demonisation of the most powerful woman in british politics is that no matter how she tries to tell it and no matter what the message is an outspoken feministidentified woman will be shot down in flames before the words have left her mouth harman could have been talking about the indisputable cuteness of small fluffy kittens and someone somewhere although probably at the daily mail would have found a reason to tear her apart indeed i cant be alone in thinking that some of this years omg who left that bint in charge of the country articles had already been written long before harman took the helm and that fleet street was just waiting for an opportune moment to stick them through the presses last year for example it was quentin letts at the mail who was tasked with envisioning a harmanled government in a piece entitled so what if harriet harperson was pm this year it was david thomas who came up with the goods my womanifesto with gordon on holiday harriet harman has launched an antimale blitzkrieg but what would she really be like as pm hillary clinton has suffered a similar fate to harman with coverage of her day tour across africa dominated by sneery headlines about her alleged inability to keep a civil tongue in her head forget the endemic rape and sexual violence of the women of the democratic republic of the congo that shes been valiantly trying to highlight all were allowed to remember about this state visit is that she gets a bit tetchy when asked for her husbands opinion instead of her own and who can blame her personally i think she handled it admirably i know how id have reacted in that situation the phrase international incident springs to mind the unprecedented vilification thats been heaped upon these two highprofile women cannot be seen in isolation as though theres no common thread running between it all its no coincidence for example that both are the highest ranked women in their respective political administrations and that both have resolutely refused to compromise their feminist beliefs equally its not just by chance that theyve both been caught out by the press at exactly the moment theyve been let off the leash when their male bosses havent been around to keep them in their place the message were supposed to take from this is obvious women quite simply cannot be trusted to run the show themselves but the message to uppity women everywhere is even clearer as swedish feminist agneta stark wrote in her essay combating the backlash how swedish women won the war the price for feminist struggle is as ever smear campaigns hate mail modest careers lost promised work opportunities suddenly disappearing and private disappointment even grief the only novelty is that the process is extremely public and perhaps that is also significant the message to women is clear these are the consequences of feminist activities this is what will happen if you speak out both harman and clinton

for kay the beatings came three weeks into her marriage she and her partner both from irish travelling families met on the road as teenagers before becoming pen pals it wasnt until they settled down on a caravan site in yorkshire that he threw his first punch hed just flip out slapping me kicking me says kay not her real name he wanted me to jump when he said to sit when i was told despite the violence in their relationship the couple had three children together and kay says she felt powerless to leave i just accepted it as normal in my culture the woman is the heart of the family the man is the head what he says goes kays story may be similar to that of the of women in the uk who are thought to experience domestic violence during their lifetimes six to of women suffer it in any given year but a recent paper by the equality and human rights commission suggests that women from the gypsy and traveller communities who report domestic violence will often have suffered it more severely and over a considerably longer period than other women although there is no conclusive evidence about the prevalence of this abuse the paper cites a study in wrexham which found that between and of married gypsy and traveller women had experienced direct abuse from a partner cultural barriers are believed to be one reason that travelling women stay in violent relationships for longer than other women kay who endured years of violence twice the uk average before she had an injunction brought against her husband feared that she might have to leave behind her whole way of life by entering a bricksandmortar refuge or being relocated into a house it would have killed me stone dead she says ive lived in trailers all my life its all i know in a house id feel cooped up and boxed in id be so alone i worried my kids would get stick for being travellers and we wouldnt feel welcome that wed get judged and treated as outsiders and would never be able to admit where we came from a reluctance to deal with the police coupled with a lack of knowledge about mainstream services may complicate the situation kay admits for all those years id refused to report his abuse if youre seen talking on your own to police you can be labelled a grass and a grass isnt allowed in our community id seen them police come to the site uninvited trashing our property talking down to the kids there was no trust there but in the end it was my brother who said leave him kay also felt that she would be stigmatised for talking about the abuse were taught to stand up for ourselves as strong travelling women if word gets out youre being hit by man woman or whoever you can be seen as weak kathleen lowther morrison a traveller from the community group leeds gypsy and traveller exchange says many travellers have traditional views on marriage with divorce a rarity and a woman leaving a marriage can be ostracised if theyve lived in a closed community all their lives and have had little education if theyve barely been to school they can assume all men are violent and domestic violence is normal gypsies see domestic violence going on all their lives if it isnt happening to their mum its happening to their sister or their neighbour although community campaigners admit that discussing violence within marriage has always been a taboo years after solas anois the uks only refuge for gypsy and travelling women was set up it is being tackled head on with new initiatives this summer saw the first conference on domestic violence in the traveller and gypsy communities with another planned for october lowther morrison says it is essential that help comes from within the community and that more people attend domestic violence courses i went on a training course myself she says it was like a light flashing in my head i never knew what domestic violence was till then half of our women still dont they think a good hiding is part of our culture bernie orourke who works at solas anois gaelic for comfort now says attitudes in the community are changing more travelling women than ever are seeking help more mothers are willing to assist their daughters in leaving violent relationships women feel more empowered change is coming in women were accommodated at the refuge a further had to be turned away because of lack of space orourke says more specialist refuges are essential to acknowledge and accommodate the particular needs of the women from the gypsy and traveller communities a lot of travelling women have low literacy and numeracy a cd or dvd version of the refuge rules and information can help some cant tell the time or arent interested in it their children may not have structured bedtimes their life is very different from that of the settled population she points out that they can be deterred from entering mainstream refuges if they experience difficulties observing cleanliness rituals known as the mochadi laws one bowl for washing up another for washing the body for example particular standards of hygiene such as using bleach to clean dishes can also cause problems with other refuge residents six months ago irish traveller bridie jones started holding cultural awareness workshops in kent now she says the police no longer take dogs into trailers or search a whole site to locate a single person its about building trust so women will come forward report violence and have confidence in what the police social services and other agencies have to offer she also runs three separate domestic violence support groups for gypsies and travellers at homes in her area i dont want people thinking that every man i know is going around hitting women because that would be far from the truth but domestic violence needs talking about more in my community it needs bringing out from beneath the carpet lowther morrison agrees and says gypsy and traveller women now want more equality in their relationships my husband respects me and what i do but theres plenty of women without that where its ok for a gypsy man to remarry but not for a woman where a woman cannot disrespect a man its a long road ahead but people are coming around to the idea more and more her project report one punch kills recommends opening a caravan site in leeds for families fleeing domestic violence were not going away this issue needs looking at and it needs more funding romany gypsy janie cadona of one voice a domestic violence advice organisation for travellers in the east of england takes women through their options when experiencing violence from a partner she agrees that culturally familiar alternatives such as safe trailers would help for those who have been living out in the open on a site all their lives or if theyre continuously nomadic it can be too big a shock living with new people in a refuge or hostel they can feel confined and isolated anxiety and depression can set in they risk leaving their life behind so they stay in a violent situation for longer often travellers turn up at refuges with six kids in tow there isnt always room to take in the whole family the irish traveller movement in britain is currently developing a womens group director yvonne macnamara says such groups can challenge sensitive issues and empower more women like kay a lot of travellers dont like the terminology domestic violence some wont touch the topic but others are saying do something which is an incredibly brave thing to do for this community its about getting information out there about teaching men women children young and old that violence isnt the way the approach needs to be sensible it needs to be different and now i believe is the time to do it the hour national domestic violence helpline number is,2009-08,kay beating came

last week the government announced cash awards for rape crisis centres and branches of the survivors trust these are specialist charities which provide frontline services to victims and survivors of rape and sexual abuse the grants which range from to mean that these organisations will be able to carry on specialist services such as counselling and advocacy to women and men who have been raped or experienced sexual violence these are not the main source of funding for these groups rather bridging finance in most cases to ensure that they remain in place local government the health sector local police and sometimes charitable trusts are the sources of core funding but for the second year in succession we have been made aware of risks to some of these muchneeded services thus even though government had already sent money to most of these core sources to pay for these frontline services we are paying again rather than risking their demise there is a stream of work on the way to try to find a more satisfactory way of making these services sustainable it is not good for the government equalities office home office and department of health to provide quasiemergency cash like this and it is even worse for rape crisis and the survivors trust to have to juggle small short term pots of money when they really want to be concentrating on providing advice and support this piece of work should come to fruition early in the autumn rape and sexual abuse is one of the most invasive and horrible crimes which someone can experience it involves violation of the most intimate kind compounded by the fact that most victims know their attacker the impact can be long lasting and difficult to deal with this isnt inevitable and those who have been raped can and do recover but many need or want to have support to do this and not just in the immediate aftermath of the crimes they have experienced sometimes the impact of a rape or sexual assault can be felt most or reemerge after the crime has happened even years later thats where the organisations which received money last week come in they can help survivors deal with the impact whenever they need it including long after the crime has happened in a safe and secure environment where they will be believed they provide the longterm support which victims might need to come to terms with their experiences only of rapes come to the attention of the police and although more cases which get to the courts are resulting in conviction there are still too few convictions compared to the number of cases reported and as this figure makes clear still far too many rapes which are not reported at all however the figures show that people reported rape in while last year the figure was there is no suggestion that the number of offences has increased and so i hope that this is an indication that complainants may be starting to feel more confident that the public authorities will deal with them sympathetically and supportively many victims find it too difficult to report what has happened to them directly to the police it is a major decision to take which must appear very daunting to someone who is already traumatised from being assaulted this is unfortunately likely to be all the more so because of the longterm publicity which has now been given to the unsatisfactory way in which earlier complainants have been treated by the criminal justice system it is ironic but i think inevitable that as we have raised the profile of this historically weak and unsupportive treatment in order to bring change we have nonetheless made these weaknesses public i hope though that people who dont feel able to go direct to the public authorities will get help from rape crisis or the survivors trust and that they will in turn encourage prosecutions wherever it is possible and practical to do so let us be plain their purpose is to aid recovery not boost the conviction figures but nonetheless there is a link between the two these organisations are so experienced and so good at giving both support and expert help that they are not only an obvious place of first resort but can be additionally a helpful intermediary who with some complainants can involve the police they will of course be passing on a strengthened complainant who has had the benefit of their support towards recovery i am very keen indeed that we should see these two excellent charities as part of the broader agenda of empowering those who have been victims of sexual assault for they are precisely victims of an offence almost deliberately geared to disempower them rape crisis and the survivors trust by facilitating the fightback against this victimisation play a role in this broader agenda specifically they can be key in our struggle to make clear that rape is often a serial offence the notion at large that rape is usually a misunderstanding between acquaintances or some kind of mix up by men not understanding womens take on sex and vice versa is not at all the whole story the cases of john worboys and kirk reid which came to light earlier this year have made that point for us in capital letters many women in each of those cases were assaulted and when they complained were disregarded in the context of having had a drink and so being potentially unreliable witnesses or were contradicted by the perpetrator and so the cases were seen as likely acquittals of the one persons word against anothers type these men went on to rape again and again thus it is in everybodys interest if victims of rape and sexual abuse make complaints even if they are undermined by the offence in the first place they can be strengthened by the input of these groups in september we will commence a review to look at how rape complaints are dealt with how much support victims get and what changes we might need to make we have conducted a number of inspections of the police and the cps and to some extent of the courts and we have taken into account the views of complainants all of these organisations have prioritised change and the figures of complaints together with a marginally improved conviction rate suggest that we are starting to make inroads however progress is too slow and too piecemeal as part of the broader consultation into the formulation of a strategy about violence against women we sought new input about rape but the returns were less numerous than those about other aspects of violence against women and so we must look again equally outwardly but in a new way as a government we are committed to tackling rape and sexual assault bringing perpetrators to justice and ensuring that victims get the help and support they need there are now sexual assault referral centres sarcs in england and wales and funding for eight more was also announced last week by my colleague david hanson sarcs are an equally key plank of the governments commitment to supporting victims and if victims want to report getting more convictions for rape and sexual abuse like the experienced and professional specialist voluntary sector organisations they are an important part of the overall range of services in support of victims something is starting to be achieved but there is so much still to do,2009-08,last week government announced cash award rape crisis centre branch survivor trust specialist charity

swine flu is set to make this summer holiday particularly difficult for single parents according to family support charity gingerbread research by the group shows that over a normal school break single parents pay out for childcare entertainment and weekday lunches at a lunch more if they have more than one child but this year parents face the prospect of having to take unscheduled time off if their children catch swine flu as most carers are unwilling and unable to look after a child that is ill this leaves single parents in an especially tricky situation says yvonne snape an advice worker for gingerbread taking leave to cover childcare over school holidays or when a child is sick is an issue for many working parents but it is made easier if there are two people who can take time off for single parents with sole responsibilty it can be a real problem its fine if youve got normal holiday leave you can use but if not you will probably have to take unpaid leave at the discretion of your employer she says there are two forms of leave available dependants leave and parental leave both unpaid dependants leave is defined in law as the right to take a reasonable amount of time off during the employees working hours in order to take action which is necessary snape says you can take dependants leave to sort out care arrangements if your child falls ill or has an accident but it is emergency leave and not intended for you to look after a child with swine flu yourself she adds you should tell your employer the reason for the time off as soon as is reasonably practicable and give an idea of when you expect to return this will usually be after a few hours or a couple of days maximum however this is at the discretion of the employer and snape warns that it is not unknown for the more vindictive to penalise employees who have to take time off on this basis not surprisingly some workers prefer to pretend they are ill themselves snape points out that parents cannot use dependancy leave if a school has to close for a period if your child looks like being ill for a while and you want to look after him or her yourself you will have to request parental leave instead you have a statutory right to this type of leave provided you meet certain criteria your child must be aged under five or under if he or she is disabled and you need to have worked for your employer for more than a year you are entitled to weeks unpaid parental leave in total however the maximum period you can take in one go is four weeks for each eligible child at any one time so if you have two children under the age of five you could take off a total of eight weeks either parent has the right to parental leave if you are separated and you dont live with your children it still applies if you keep formal parental responsibility however the biggest sticking point is that you need to give days notice or hope that your employer will negotiate with you this requirement may make life very difficult if the government decides to keep schools closed when the summer holiday ends recently ed balls the secretary of state for the department for children schools and families said at every stage the government has been and will be guided by the best scientific and expert health advice and what is in the best interests of children given current information on the virus which for most people results in a mild illness experts have advised against mass closure of schools which as a recent article in medical journal the lancet points out would be disruptive and have high social and economic costs but he refused to rule out such a move adding we will be monitoring the situation closely over the school holidays and will review the evidence in late august anna white a single mother of an eightyearold boy got so fed up with having to leave her son with a carer or being forced to take unpaid leave she decided to work for herself losing money taking unpaid leave then going back to frosty looks and quiet accusations of not being committed became unbearable she says when her son contracted swine flu recently anna had already left her job as a youth offending officer and was selfemployed so she was able to take the time off without any difficulty she is now running workshops for children who are at risk of being or have already been excluded from school or have been convicted of criminal activities there are around five workshops a month during normal court hours am to pm and she does the preparation from home enabling her to pick up her son from school most days if she needs to work at weekends she employs someone to do the work on her behalf the effect on her son was almost instant within a week of cutting my hours he changed his teacher said he was much more relaxed happier anna says she had continued working full and often unsociable hours because i didnt want people to think i was a scrounger or lazy but looking back that attitude has meant she has sometimes left her son in the care of people she wasnt totally happy with she adds children dont lose out necessarily because they havent got both parents there all the time but they do if they have a stressed single parent its quite isolating working for yourself but as a single parent i wish i had done this years ago further information keep up to date on the governments latest thoughts on school closures at teachernetgovukeducationoverviewflupandemic single parents should always seek advice about any extra benefits or tax credits that they may be able to claim if taking unpaid leave the gingerbread single parent helpline is open from am to pm monday to friday on and can provide information and advice on all of these issues juggling a job and childcare melissa santiagoval a single parent of children aged five and eight tried several ways to meet her responsibilities as marketing manager of a big charity while ensuring she could manage childcare arrangements during school holidays in her sons final year of nursery she took a months unpaid holiday spreading the loss of salary over the year but even this didnt solve the problem that her children get far more holiday than she or her former partner could cover with their annual entitlement i was managing a team at the charity which included a lot of mums and we all wanted time off it was becoming difficult and stressful she says so she recently quit her job to take up a parttime position at a private school in cambridge this gives more flexibility in the school holidays and allows her to work when the children are with their dad its obviously busier during term times at a school but i can still work during the holidays and weekends when the children arent with me to make up some time she says the switch has involved a cut in salary and the family have had to adapt their lifestyle now its countryside walks free museum visits and camping id rather be doing that and spending time with my children than earning more and spending money on childcare you have to be more imaginative on a tight budget she says melissa has also turned to charities such as gingerbread for advice on budgeting and when her son was born she had help from homestart its volunteers support families with children under five she is now a trustee of her local homestart scheme in royston and south cambridgeshire and encourages people to get involved in helping other single parents in her position charities supporting people like this can be a lifeline and offer practical financial support and signposting if her children develop swine flu melissa is lucky in that her mum lives nearby and is able to help if they fall ill it will be more difficult if the government decides to quarantine everyone and we all have to take parental leave im very aware that as a oneincome family i cant just take unpaid leave and the drop in income she says but everybody will be in the same boat and we have to hope employers will be

top table was in a straight line or a horseshoe i can assure coca cola that there are no women goofing around making rabbit ears behind their husbands heads on their wedding photos the only female

to some they are objects of empowering modern feminism to others they are an example of misogynistic male fantasy to yet others they are simply titillating one thing however is not in doubt cougars are prowling all over the american cultural landscape and they are not the mountainlion kind cougar is a term used to describe an older woman who uses the same predatory sexual techniques as men including focusing on members of the opposite sex who are much younger than she is think of the graduates mrs robinson but updated and without the psychological hangups it began as a term of thinly veiled abuse considered a derisive insult to older single women but now the term has gradually entered the mainstream especially through television that has stirred a fierce debate over whether the term is a triumph for women or a disastrous setback last week saw the debut of the new sitcom cougar town starring former friends actress courteney cox who plays an older woman with a teenage son who relentlessly goes after younger men as sexual conquests she flashes a paperboy and eyes up a younger man with the words id love to lick his body the show which was aired on abc in prime time and received generally good audience figures was described as ridiculous and belittling by a new york times columnist yet cougar town is just the thin end of a cougar invasion of television another sitcom cbss accidentally on purpose features jenna elfman as a late s woman impregnated by a yearold on a onenight stand then there is the reality tv show called the cougar in which a yearold real estate agent and divorced motheroffour chooses from among a pack of young men in their early s eager to date her neither is it just tv jennifer aniston apparently without irony given her media status as the symbol of older single women in america is preparing to feature in a film called pumas she and her costars are women in their s who enjoy the romantic attentions of much younger men pumas are meant to be slightly younger cougarsinwaiting michelle pfeiffer recently played a woman courtesan tasked with the seduction of a much younger man in the film cheri she received great reviews based mainly on her continuing beauty then there are those who have been branded reallife cougars by the media such as madonna who is dating yearold jesus luz a brazilian model and mariah carey who is years older than her new husband nick cannon bizarrely the indian actress freida pinto who is just was given the label in some parts of the tabloid press when she started dating her costar from slumdog millionaire dev patel the phenomenon has crossed the atlantic one newspaper recently crowned yearold actress amanda redman britains favourite cougar redman whose longterm partner damian schnabel is said the men she had found to be most caring sensitive and nurturing were all younger previous boyfriends include oliver boot who is years younger than she is and the actor adam rayner years her junior as for noncelebrities a growing number of people are signing up to dating websites designed for older women and younger men dateacougarcom has a british section filled with profiles of men in their s and women in their s and s young stud wants older woman says one posting by a yearold man from streatham south london even holiday operators are trying to cash in in the us there will soon be a cougar cruise organised by boat operator carnival cruise lines it will be hosted by gloria navarro a woman who won a beauty pageant entitled miss cougar america she won her title at the firstever national single cougar convention in california at the same time numerous dating evenings for selfdeclared cougars are held across america where older woman can meet and date the younger men who desire them some commentators have hailed the entry of the term cougar into the mainstream as a sign of female liberation they say the tv shows films and events are showing off a powerful female sexuality for example few would bat an eye at a dating show featuring a man picking from women much younger than himself cougars perhaps are simply claiming the sexual high ground from the sex that has traditionally held it author valerie gibson who has written a book called cougar a guide for older women dating younger men has defended the term as an example of liberation a cougar is the new breed of single older woman confident sophisticated desirable and sexy she knows exactly what she wants what she wants is younger men and lots of great sex what she doesnt want is children cohabitation or commitment former magazine editor bonnie fuller joined the debate declaring its official age is irrelevant when it comes to women and beauty that is of course cougars have long existed some highprofile celebrity couplings may have helped to inspire the acceptance of the word foremost among them is the marriage between ashton kutcher and demi moore who appear happily wed despite moore being years older than her spouse adding to the spice is the fact that the union is often reported as being one of the most stable and happy in hollywood but elsewhere cougars are facing a backlash the real tipping point for critics appears to be cougar town late last week in the wake of the first episode of coxs new show several leading women critics decided to speak out against the label they called it a backward step for womens rights and said the type of feminism that it represented was based on what men think of women not what women might think of themselves this is the st century where pole dancing passes for a statement of female liberation so it should come as no surprise that jules coxs character will search for selfesteem in frequent sex and the proof that she is still hot seethed wall street journal writer nancy dewolf smith such a slamming was mild compared to that dished out by judith warner the new york times columnist who writes the newspapers domestic disturbances blog it was hard for me to find words for why i hated simply hated cougar town she wrote its girlsgonewild feminism for fortysomethings its ridiculous and belittling warner went on to eviscerate what she saw as the modern cultural landscape that had allowed cougar to go from insult to accepted term jules visibly vibrating with selfdoubt and thinlyveiled selfloathing is its fair to say probably the least likely figure of fantasy to be conjured by women coxs age she said she is such a twit so narcissistic so superficial so stunted emotionally so very unthreatening so very pitiful british commentators have also joined the debate kathryn flett the observers television critic and star of the bbcs grumpy old women said the problem was the label itself the term cougar is horrible it is demeaning it is the whole predatory feline sexual thing moreover it was hardly empowering for women to see the phenomenon played out on screen by glamorous celebrities who had little in common with a typical fortysomething she said television is going to make things shiny that is its job it is drama it is escapism but the trend did exist she added what television does is hold up a mirror to society it is always writ large and cartoonish but nevertheless it has emerged from a genuine phenomenon i can tell you that there are a lot of single women for the sake of argument in their s having relationships with younger men and if the phenomenon is a reality in the us then psychologists say it is sure to be thriving here as well it is interesting from a sexual point of view because there is evidence that men are at their sexual peak in their late teens and early s while women reach it closer to said roy shuttleworth a clinical psychologist based in london a young man may be full of testosterone but have a limited clue as what he should do with it if an older woman showed him a few tricks they could experience the same level of intensity shuttleworth argued that another reason young men and women sometimes sought older partners was that they were leaving home and wanted a paternal or maternal figure that could result in problems however when they reached their mid or late s and decided they wanted a playmate instead he added the danger in any relationship is that we change in our needs as for cougars shuttleworth argued that older men dating younger women would never be treated in such a demeaning manner others agreed including warner who said it was not just cougar town that had made her angry she pointed out that the tv and movie industry championing the wave of cougarthemed shows and movies was overwhelmingly maledominated the image of the cougar she argued was more a product of an adolescent sexual fantasy among male studio executives than anything to do with women themselves in the cougar fantasy you find all the most cartoonish aspects of boorish middleaged masculinity im sure we can generate better fantasies for ourselves she concluded whether the world of television and cinema rises to that challenge remains to be seen,2009-09,object empowering modern feminism others example misogynistic male fantasy yet others simply titillating one thing

what does feminism mean to you youd better decide quickly because by the end of the year we will be facing a barrage of books on the subject and it will be as well to get things clear in our ladyminds as soon as possible so we can accordingly assess the opinions of kat banyard from the fawcett society catherine redfern founder of the fword website natasha walter author of the new feminism and ellie levenson who is leading the charge with the noughtie girls guide to feminism and not get too behind on the ironing an additional spur has been provided by margaret atwood who recently told a gathering i dont know if i am a feminist and fay weldon who has moved from promulgating the living and loving of life as a fully empowered shedevil to recommending that we give up nagging men to pick their socks up off the floor because its easier just to do it yourself to say nothing of course of dame judi dench distancing herself from the word in this ere paper a few weeks back i wish my own feminism had been a matter of careful thought and formulation underpinned by the kind of muscular theorising that could make it stand firm against the many blows that any attempt to assert ones belief that women are uh equal to men and so should be treated as such can still expect to be dealt half a bleedin century after the idea was first widely raised but alas it has been assembled largely piecemeal more often than not a tiny but outrageous snippet of news lodges in my head like a burr and gradually an opinion forms around it like a callus to prevent me going insane for example when i was i read an interview with the then superest of supermodels claudia schiffer wherein she assured us that even she was not perfect she had wait for it an uneven hairline that planted deep within me the seed of a suspicion that a world in which a young woman could have this thought and offer it to other young women as a form of comfort was possibly not one that was arranged entirely for our pleasure or convenience a seed that over the years has sprouted and flourished like the green bay tree or there was the time during her sojourn in the im a celebrity jungle when the notion took hold in the media that jordankatie price is some kind of feminist heroine and still has not completely died out i remain unsure as to precisely how it happened i think there must have been some kind of confusion between mutilating and exposing your bazonkas for money and moral intellectual or social progress but shes a very successful businesswoman some will cry to which surprisingly few cry back yes by mutilating and exposing her bazonkas for money this is not i have mused to myself many times since what feminism means the original idea i believe was that women would eventually be free to move on towards better more fulfilling lives and careers that did not depend on creating a lucrative desire among the male populace to get a grip on their specially constructed anatomical parts the only official piece of doctrine that has ever made sense to me is that of different but equal if only because it is the one capable of bearing the interpretation that while men are useless at everything bar the big stuff such as creating empires and wars women are nuts we can do everything else and probably wars and empires too if we put our minds to it its just that we really really have no interest but we are nuts we invest stars planets and bars of cocoa bean extract and hydrogenated vegetable fat with the power to affect our lives we wake up feeling namelessly guilty and we havent yet crowned

when the equal opportunities commission funded a research project to find out the reasons behind the gender pay gap the answer was that the unequal sharing of childcare responsibilities between mothers and fathers was the biggest single driver so it is good news that the joseph rowntree foundation has found that men are spending more time on childcare this generation of fathers is more likely to be changing nappies and getting up to see to children in the night but this insight into domestic arrangements of families in three different ethnic groups still shows differences between what mothers and fathers do and how their roles are conceptualised in most of these homes while fathers were expected to engage in all aspects of raising children and their own fathers were described as being mainly responsible for breadwinning and discipline economic provision was still seen largely as their responsibility and as defining their role the study also found that while the time fathers spent with their children varied considerably across ethnic groups mainly due to differences in employment and working hours and the average dad was spending a whopping hours per day interacting with his children fatherchild time tended to be playtime on average three hours per day particularly in middle childhood perhaps this is not surprising given that working fathers tend to spend most of their time with children during leisure time mothers were much more likely to do the practical childcare the cooking the cleaning with some fathers spending no more than minutes a day on direct caregiving although african caribbean dads in this study spent twice that fathers have been considered childrens playmates for almost a century now in the s and s middleclass dads were urged to rush from the commuter train to the nursery for preslumber rough and tumble this though enjoyable and valuable for childrens positive development has ironically contributed to mens marginalisation as parents its not very far from being king of the kiddies to being seen as one of the kiddies with wise responsible mum as the really serious parent both loving and angry dishing out the dinner and hugs and trying to calm things down it is striking that after more than four decades of women asserting their rights to work men are still seen as the primary breadwinners and women the lynchpins of domestic life we retain deeply held cultural beliefs around the supremacy of motherhood which have persisted even in the face of research showing that men are just as able as women to care for infants and children but there is now a large body of evidence showing that where fathers play a significant caring role their children will be much less likely to smoke take drugs binge drink and be sexually active at an early age so we have a lot to gain from encouraging fathers to continue expanding their role in the household however we will need to allow them to relinquish at least some of their responsibility for breadwinning if we want to make this possible the system for leave for parents does little to unlock the assumption that breadwinning is mainly for fathers even after the governments announcement that mothers will be able to share at least some of their low paidunpaid leave entitlement with their partner most families will continue to find that they cannot afford to lose the fathers income for more than one or two weeks after the birth of a child and many not even that the financial carrots and sticks built into the leave system pull women into the home and push men back out to the work place and womens pay and longterm career prospects suffer as a result until we break down this directive system and enable men to take parenting leave at a realistic rate of pay our unequal sharing of childcare duties will continue to fuel the gender pay gap,2009-09,equal opportunity commission funded research project find reason behind gender pay gap answer wa unequal

it was the inaugural meeting of the daddy mondays yesterday a buddy and i have both gone down to a fourday week to bond with our babies help our partners get back to work and give a little less money to the snotsoaked viral breeding centre that is the local nursery and its a blessed relief to have company because daycare dads still in a tiny minority can feel a little like lone wolves excluded from the coffeeandcake email lists and a touch uncomfortable in the drumming and singing circle but today the government seems to be unleashing a prampushing army of fathers into the world at a stroke with its announcement of hugely extended paternity leave the proposed plan is that after the first six months of maternity leave nontransferable because as robert de niro once said you cant milk a man couples will have the right to swap securing dad three months paid leave and three months unpaid on the face of it this can only be applauded the sort of brave benign legislation governments produce on their way out of office it could be a glorious opportunity for men to get to know their infant child to bring added trust and confidence into that childs life through the knowledge not always available that there are two people it can rely on unconditionally and to learn skills that will give their partners blessed relief long after the leave is over and the fact that the federation of small businesses has only complained about the paperwork not the cost really is a stamp of approval but as with all parental legislation theres something else going on macroeconomics primarily this isnt about building better dads but more productive mums the paternity announcement coincides with a broken promise to extend paid maternity leave from nine months to a year this highlights what the paternity push is really aiming to achieve getting more professional women back into their original jobs after childbirth dad taking over should be a more pleasant pathway back into the office for mum now only away from work for six months not a year and thus the government hopes much more likely to find a way to balance her previous highflying work with motherhood the real target here is the wasteful public investment of educating women to a professional standard getting a decade of highyield work in return then watching them choose three days a week in a florist because otherwise their toddler will have to learn to microwave that may seem fair and wise but persuading more women to stay on top isnt i think a point of principle for our leaders but one of gdp downshifting mums are an economic brake but will fathers take the offer up well in iceland a similar scheme has almost full takeup but they pay a hefty of your salary for three months off while in denmark its notable that when given control over the dates couples still divide their parental leave about in favour of mothers but the most significant statistic may be that in icelands birth rate was the second highest in europe after turkey because thats the other hidden agenda they might talk publicly of carbon footprints and crowded islands but our political masters desperately want us to breed and they would never ever say it out loud but they particularly want all you female doctors lawyers and business leaders to produce more publiclylowmaintenance kids what looks like liberation often turns out to be a

the debate on domestic violence dv statistics took a fascinating turn last week recent years have seen numerous surveys which suggest that incidents involving male victims and female perpetrators are more common than had previously been assumed mens charities have long argued that the official crime figures significantly underrepresent the problem because so few men report abuse to the authorities and those that do are likely to be disbelieved often to the extent of being arrested themselves when police arrive last week the media reported a study by professor marianne hester which analysed a matchedpairs sample from the northumbria police database of dv incidents over a sixyear period hesters report actually tells us little that we didnt already know the most eyecatching details to me at least are the findings that female perpetrators are more than twice as likely to use a weapon as their male equivalents and that couples where both parties are prone to aggression have police callouts about four times as often as those couples with only one regular aggressor in that light it is disappointing that the university of bristol press release which formed the basis of all the press reports chose to lead with the revelation that women are three times more likely to be arrested as men when they commit such acts that hardly fits with claims that police dont take male victims seriously can these competing claims be in any way reconciled i think they can hesters study found that male perpetrators are arrested on average after one in incidents whereas with a female perpetrator it is one in three when an incident of suspected dv is reported to northumbria police officers will always attend the scene when they arrive they are expected to identify the primary aggressor and according to acpo guidelines if there is any evidence of a crime having been committed or if someone is in danger they should always make an arrest since the priority is to defuse the situation and ensure the victims safety they are instructed to make only one arrest where possible and according to the data dual arrests are indeed extremely rare officers will later enter a short description of the incident in the database the statistics here tell us that even though police are required to make an arrest if there is any evidence of a crime having occurred they usually do not presumably because there are no grounds to do so this is not surprising in practice officers will often arrive after a situation has pacified with neither party wishing to make a formal complaint or they may find an ongoing chaotic scene of anger tears accusations and counteraccusations often involving people influenced by drink or drugs but no actual violence evident and no coherent testimony if it seems likely that the situation will escalate into violence again when police leave an arrest will have to be made usually on grounds of breach of the peace by far the most common offence recorded in the study when no arrest is made it will usually be because the scene is relatively safe andor ambiguous with no clear perpetrator victim or specific evidence of an offence nevertheless for the purposes of the police dv database officers are still required to identify a person whom they think is the primary aggressor that one little judgment may be the key to this mystery what we have here is not the ratio of how many menwomen are arrested against how often they have committed an offence but the ratio of how many menwomen are arrested against how often a police officer decides that on the balance of probabilities they might have been more at fault if the mens groups claims about the police are valid these results are in fact exactly what we should expect to see the assumption in the vast majority of ambiguous cases has been that the man is to blame what initially looks like a clear case of discrimination against women may in fact be a product of prejudice against men of course it could be that the police officers are entirely accurate in all their assessments and the men are indeed the primary aggressors in the vast majority of those incidents or these data could be hiding a rash of violent attacks against men unfortunately one needs to read hesters paper very closely to unravel this explanation nowhere in the report does she consider the possibility that the data she is using may be corrupted by the underlying biases assumptions or slapdash paperwork of overworked police officers,2009-09,debate domestic violence dv statistic took fascinating turn last

when it comes to how we treat our mothers the uk doesnt fare very well in a european league table of maternity benefits it comes behind sweden of course and pretty much everybody else but what about the countrys fathers a report last week showed that almost half of all men failed to takeup their meagre offering of two weeks paternity leave although the equality and human rights commission which carried out the research found that most men who failed to take the provision did so because they felt unable to afford it it pays just per week critics were quick to draw their own conclusions the journalist james delingpole claimed in the daily mail that he knew the real problem that men simply werent interested in childcare and the truth however unpalatable he declared is that our selfesteem and happiness depends far less on how good we feel as parents than on how well we feel were doing out there in the big nasty competitive aggressive world of moneymaking its the way were designed funny then that in sweden where mothers and fathers are given similar and far superior leave that only of men fail to take up any of the benefits what would delingpole have us believe about that could it be that the men of london are somehow designed differently from their counterparts less than miles northeast in stockholm pretty unlikely so then what could it be that is stopping our british fathers being fathers after all last weeks research was not restricted to paternity leave it also found that two out of five men were afraid of asking for flexible working lest it harm their careers by making them appear uncommitted the same number admitted to feeling that they spent too little time with their children clearly there is something going on within british culture and one thing driving our culture is the legal framework in which it operates in a country that offers men two weeks paternity leave for less than after the birth of their child compared to a year for the mother is it little surprise that views like delingpoles flourish to me the unequal offerings are a signal from the government that in this society machomen belong in the office while maternalmums should take the lead at home and that isnt always rational i know that among my own friends in their late s and early s there are a number of couples where the woman earns more and the man is extremely comfortable in a domestic role in those cases it might make economic and social sense for the woman to pursue her career while the man takes a step back yet if i ask them what they think the answers are always familiar that it is not what is expected others argue that even if paternity and maternity were even women would still choose to be the prime carer the case of sweden where takeup of paternity leave was low when it was first introduced suggests that isnt necessarily the case but even if it is isnt it better for couples to have a real choice a big change on the horizon is the one in that will pave the way for men to take the second six months of their partners maternity leave if the woman returns to work it is a welcome change but it still starts with the same basic premise because the leave is offered to the woman who can then choose to pass it on to instigate a real shift in culture it would be better to offer it to them both and let them decide because when men do shake off the cultural chain that binds them to the office and their breadwinner role they can be wonderful fulltime fathers one couple i know in north london who have a monthold son have switched roles with great success and what the father jeremy has found is that there are a whole community of similar superdads in the local area maybe if the government pushed a little harder than it has so far said it will it could be a story repeated in towns and cities all over the country,2009-10,come treat mother uk doesnt fare well european league table maternity benefit come behind sweden course pretty much everybody else country father report last week showed almost half men failed takeup meagre offering two week paternity leave although equality human right commission carried research found men failed take provision

should i wait for the next interview to say id rather go parttime i am on maternity leave with an eightmonthold baby i am currently on the search for a parttimeflexible job so i can stay at home with my baby for at least two days a week however im finding parttime jobs are rarely advertised and ive been applying for fulltime jobs to see how the land lies i have now got a second interview for an excellent job that prebaby i would have jumped through hoops to get but its fulltime they know i have a baby and when they asked me about my worklife balance i said i would need to leave work on time each night getting a second interview was a surprise as i assumed they would have written me off for being honest about my hours i am now considering speaking to them before the interview and explaining that ive changed my mind and am not ready for a fivedayaweek job but asking if they would consider fewer hours or even a freelance role i am a journalist copywriter however my second interview is with someone i havent met yet the managing director and im wondering if i should still go impress him and if i get offered the job negotiate then i have a niggling thought though that they would feel as though ive wasted their time and ruin my chances anyway so is it better to be honest before i go any further the reason youve been called for a second interview is because you impressed them i know you let them believe that you could do a fiveday week but they knew you had an eightmonthold baby and they knew youd have to leave on the dot every night so they cant have been in any doubt that time would be something of a problem for you yet still theyve called you for another interview all this suggests that so far at least they like you enough to consider being flexible about working hours but you still havent seen the md and if you go into that interview on false pretences youll forfeit much of the goodwill youve established so you should email not just phone the people youve already seen write it in such a way that they can show it to their md tell them how much you enjoyed hearing about the job and how much you liked the company but you now know youll need more time with your baby than you originally believed and they should know that before you see their md youd hate to waste his time you still very much hope that it might be possible to come to an arrangement that would suit you both youd love to work for them that may not be enough but the alternative would be both dishonest and fatal for your chances my lowly admin job is under review should i retrain as a teacher please help i graduated university with a in history last year and very quickly got a job doing admin in local government i love my job and the people i work with but at around a year i feel it is a little lowpaid for my qualifications at first i thought it would be a fantastic way to get a foot in the door but for the past few months there has been a review of admin and technical staff taking place and the people in charge of this review have been a little shady on whether or not there will be job losses it is certainly starting to look as though this will be the case and as i have only been there for a year i really do not fancy having to apply for my job again only to be earning the same low amount on top of this it seems that some of the flexibility of my role will be taken away and i would be pigeonholed into something that i fear i would find dull i have been applying for other jobs with better pay at the local authority with no success i feel that with a fairly decent degree i should be making more use of this and feel teaching would be something i could really enjoy and find far more interesting than general admin work the trouble is i cant afford to give up work and do a pgce or even do a pgce part time i have recently heard about graduate teacher programmes gtp and think that this might be a way to do it on a gtp youd be employed by a school so youd be paid a salary while you learned on the job places are limited and the standard of training inevitably varies according to the school it would qualify you to teach history the subject of your degree in england only i think as you can tell my knowledge is limited so if you havent already done so you should certainly scour the internet maybe starting with tdagovuk for further information and reports from those whove actually followed the gtp route some guardian readers will have had personal experience of gtps and their views will be very welcome but before you start applying id urge you to think even more carefully about such a change of direction you love your current job and you love the people you work with as its your first job you may not fully realise just how fortunate this makes you i can quite understand how uneasy you feel about the ongoing review the possibility of change and even the loss of your job must be deeply unsettling but do wait and see what actually happens youve little to lose to make a decision as important as this based on speculation wouldnt be at all sensible please dont think im discouraging you from becoming a teacher it could well give you far greater satisfaction than a long career in general admin and if youd hated every minute of the last year id probably be urging you to pack it in as soon as possible im just gently reminding you that a job you love shouldnt be lightly discarded readers advice in response to your reader feeling the urge to change from his current expertise and phd field into a role in media sat dear jeremy october i suggest he starts a blog on topics related to the developing world this way he can try out how regular writing suits him and build up a track record of his expertise online he could combine this with a twitter account and tweet about new posts to drive traffic to his blog if in his tweets he uses tags eg africa or ecuador then over time subscribers to these tags will get to know about his blog its important he plans ahead so he can establish a regular blog presence it will have to be treated like a job time needs to be set aside for research and writing once he has reached maybe twitter followers and written a range of blog posts he should contact newspaper tv and radio editors and tell them about it one might read it and find it a good resource for thoughts and topics the more unique the topics he writes about the higher his chances are of standing out what your reader really wants next is to be the kind of person that newspapers radio stations and tv producers use as a freelance writer or specialist commentator in these challenging economic times this will only happen once he has proved his expertise and writing skills even internships are now hard to get without proven experience your readers phd i assume it is related to the developing world or similar will be useful in the context of acting as journalist and specialist another idea is to attend conferences where people interested in the developing world gather he should have a business card with his twitter name and the blogs url on it and hand it out freely claudia

im a man says tom therefore i work therefore i dont do childcare or at least not much thats what my wife does tom is one of those unreconstructed fathers whose worldview flies in the face of todays report from the equality and human rights commission ehrc which suggests the majority of working fathers are unhappy with their worklife balance the fathers family and work report found that that of fathers thought that dads should spend more time caring for their children tom a shoe salesman from birmingham who spends most of his working life on the english motorway system in a skoda octavia estate is married with a threeyearold daughter and an monthold son he didnt take the two weeks paternity leave to which he was entitled and has never sought to go parttime his wife sue who was a shop assistant before their first child was born is now a fulltime mother dont you miss spending time with your children i ask tom i cant afford to think that way sue cant make the money that i can we cant afford childcare so i wind up working plus hours a week often six days otherwise the family doesnt function but arent you rationalising the fact that you dont want to do childcare well i certainly dont want to be in a womans world hanging out at playgroups and coffee mornings thats my nightmare i like being weekend dad taking kids swimming and doing the fun stuff would if make any difference if you were able to go to parttime working i cant imagine that working in my business you go parttime and you risk not being taken seriously whether youre a man or a woman i have to say i like being the man bringing home the bacon i get a kick out of that but maybe working fathers and their employers would benefit from reducing their hours the ehrc report found that six out of fathers work more than hours a week yet a recent survey of american human resources directors by researchers at brigham young university in utah found that where city ie local authority employees had been offered flexitime or parttime contracts said the new working patterns improved morale and said they improved productivity but do fathers really want to reduce their working hours to spend more time with their kids yes they do says duncan fisher the founder of fathers direct who gave up a job in international development to raise his two daughters and runs the dadinfo website its a very slow process because there are lots of things blocking them workplace cultures and pay but the impulse is definitely there fisher argues that the process will only be accelerated when there is a mechanism that incentivises working fathers to spend more time doing childcare that mechanism seemed at least to be offered last month when labours deputy leader harriet harman announced a reform whereby mothers would be able to choose to transfer the last six months of their maternity leave to the father three months of which would be paid this gives families radically more choice and flexibility in how they balance work and care of children and enables fathers to play a bigger part in bringing up their children said harman the minister for women and equality id love it if that happened says david a website editor who has just returned to fulltime work after taking two weeks paternity leave to which he added a week of annual leave while i was on paternity leave i felt as though my partner and i were sharing the childcare equally and that felt great now ive gone back to work i feel im missing out i cant afford to do anything but work fulltime now my partner is raising our daughter and anyway my employers wouldnt allow me to go parttime harmans announcement though was greeted with less enthusiasm by david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce a recession he said was not a good time to introduce this reform it is a huge burden to plan for both a male and a female employee being away many employers are hostile to the idea of making fathers take more paternity leave its not said out loud but lots of companies especially small ones dont employ women they think are going to be pregnant and who will take leave says the manager of a fruitandveg wholesaler in london who employs people if men start taking larger chunks of paternity leave then fatherstobe will be regarded with the same suspicion as motherstobe historically employers groups have worried about the cost to taxpayers of any extension to parental leave when for instance the ehrc called on the government to introduce a yearplan to encourage greater parity between maternity and paternity leave earlier this year it was greeted with wails from employers groups the ehrc proposal included an additional four months of parental leave after the mothers initial six months leave which either parent could take with at least eight weeks at pay the cbis director of human resources policy katja hall said at the time given the alarming state of the public finances these plans which would cost taxpayers an extra bn are unaffordable she said it would be better to encourage flexible working which would not increase costs to employers or taxpayers fisher is also sceptical about the benefits of parental leave reform he argues it would do nothing to encourage working fathers to reduce their hours the takeup is going to to be very small women will not hand over their maternity leave to men fisher argues that mothers are used to having the lions share of time off and would be unwilling to allow men to take the primary childcare role unless they were compelled to instead fisher prefers the lib dem proposal to reform parental leave which he says would provide just the mechanism to encourage fathers to alter their worklife balance and do more childcare the proposal unveiled by lib dem leader nick clegg earlier this year is modelled on parental leave systems in other european countries such as norway clegg says we would introduce months of interchangeable parental leave with no parent taking more than a year parents could divide it between themselves perhaps taking nine months each or they could choose to take time together by insisting the leave is shared we avoid the trap of mothers feeling under pressure to take the whole year and a half why is this better than the harman plan i ask fisher the number of men that would take time off given the proper opportunity would be huge of course that opportunity looks unlikely based as it is on the lib dems wielding power in whitehall any time soon some fathers arent waiting for a reform to parental leave to make their dream of doing more childcare a reality two years ago rob went part time as a newspaper subeditor now he spends mondays and tuesdays with the children while his partner jo who works in adult education looks after them on wednesdays thursdays and fridays but this arrangement is unusual the office for national statistics report focus on gender found that at the start of of women with dependent children worked parttime compared with only of men with dependent children rob says we wanted to look after our kids ourselves it seemed crazy to pay someone else to look after them when i was working fulltime and jo parttime we had to shape our lives around the hours of our childminder we dont have to do that any more and i always wanted to be an involved father in this rob was very different from his late father he worked all his life in a bank and my mum was a housewife she did the childcare i think he felt he had to remain distant to maintain his authority that was his weakness when rob went parttime his father was critical he worried about pensions about job security and my career when we spoke on the phone on days when i was looking after the kids hed usually have a dig got your pinnie on sent the wife out to work that kind of thing but rob believes that going parttime has changed his relationship with his children its a much more honest relationship with them than it was before i was the kind of dad who would come home from work or at the weekends and just do the exciting stuff with them the park the pool football now i have to do the hard stuff too is it difficult to be divide your week between childcare and work somebody at work a man said to me the other day when i complained i was feeling tired at the weekend but you only work three days a week its as though the other two days where i work with the kids are nothing youre thought of as a slacker as a man when you go parttime i dont think anyone would dream of saying that to a woman who juggles a career and childcare youre on your own and thats a problem there hasnt been a male movement theres no germaine greer saying men have had enough of being at work they want to spend time with their children too dan quit his job working for the highways department in a london council because he wanted to establish a bond with his son that he never had with his own father my dad was in the raf so we wouldnt see him for six months at a time and when he was home he was really absent i didnt want to be like that dan is though an unusual case last year the office for national statistics reported that there were househusbands in the uk british housewives still outnumber househusbands by almost to i chose my son over my career dan who now works as a drugs counsellor in fife argues he could only switch to such an enriching lifestyle because his partner susan had a wellpaid secure job in the public sector we just sat down and went through all the issues i hated my job the childcare costs were prohibitive and i really wanted to be close to my son hamish when my daughter jess was born shes now six i left work again for the same reason it has paid dividends in terms of how my kids feel about me and how i relate to them he also argues it has made his relationship with susan stronger all those resentments that mothers have about absent fathers just dont happen does dan have any regrets about cutting back on paid work not at all its such a fleeting time hamish is now and in a couple of years he wont want to know me i needed to grab as much time as possible to spend with him what about your career honestly i thought it was less important than my son jake currently a househusband in norfolk is much more conflicted about his life choices than dan when i ask him about leaving his job as a software developer to look after his two children while his partner sheila works three days a week for a development charity in london he says i am more contented than i have ever been then he lists the downsides its the sheer bloody monotony that is difficult the fact that you sit down to eat at five oclock and its always a meal with no spices this is no doubt how many mothers have been feeling for millennia so why did jake opt for this lifestyle when sophie was born we both took sabbaticals and when it became a question of who should go back to work i strongly felt sheila should rather than me as i was doing a soulless meaningless job but does he yearn to go back to work sometimes i feel just like wendy craig in the s sitcom butterflies that thing about wandering the streets thinking real life is going on elsewhere i want to feel part of the real world ideally both of us would work parttime all the househusbands i spoke to struggled with being a man in an overwhelmingly womens world of childcare the first years were gruelling says duncan fisher whose wife remained in her nhs job after he left his it was a totally female world and i definitely had to run the female gauntlet i remember a woman at the checkout saying how old is your child i said two she replied are you sure another woman said how nicely my child was dressed and then turned to my daughter and said hasnt your mother turned you out well well no actually it was me who did that its all about overturning centuries of gender assumptions its going to be a battle is a recession really the time to fight this battle some companies are proposing parttime work right now putting workers on parttime contracts during recession so as to cut costs and not make people redundant is a good idea they can return to fulltime working as the economy picks up thats good for employers because it keeps employees in the workplace and it also means that fathers are more likely to get an opportunity to go part time earlier this year accountancy company kpmg started offering employees the option of a fourday week to avoid job losses so far of its employees have applied to join the scheme but ultimately parttime work is hardly a panacea to making fathers change their worklife balances and do more childcare especially if it means the same number of working hours including childcare for less pay for couples with children already struggling in harsh economic circumstances such contracts are unlikely to be appealing it depends on the economic circumstances of each family as to whether there would be take up for this kind of change agrees fisher but i think parttime work is the ultimate answer for mothers and fathers if were serious about changing worklife balance and making childcare something that men do more than ever before then its image needs to be changed the main problem is that men fear that if you do childcare rather than paid work you lose a sense of who you are i think that its a phantom fear its a fear of the unknown men have to get over it some names and personal details have been changed,2009-10,im man say tom therefore work therefore dont childcare least much thats wife

working fathers are struggling to juggle the competing demands of family and career according to a report that shows that they are just as uneasy with their worklife balance as mothers the report by the equality and human rights commission ehrc suggests that the longrunning debate over the pressures experienced by working mothers who strive to have it all children and careers is just as relevant to working fathers studies on worklife balance have usually focused on women helping to create a stereotype of the guiltridden mother who professes to be cutting corners in every segment of her life the fathers family and work report published tomorrow attempts to redress this emphasis on women looking at mens attitudes to work and family life and finding fathers equally under pressure research conducted by the ehrc shows many fathers are dissatisfied with the amount of time they spend at work and the amount of time they spend with their children some of fathers with children under one felt they were not devoting enough time to them while of fathers felt they were not able to spend enough time with their children the report also found of fathers thought that in general fathers should spend more time caring for their children the research confirmed fathers are working long hours with six out of working more than hours a week the desire of many fathers to spend more time with their children can be frustrated by long working hours and inflexible workplaces leading to tensions between work and family the report says fathers were more unhappy with their working hours than mothers only of fathers thought they spent about the right amount of time at work compared with of mothers the report paints a picture of a modern working father who feels miserable about the proportion of time he is able to devote to his children but who is too nervous to demand flexible working from his employers about two in five men fear that asking for flexible working arrangements would result in their commitment to their job being questioned and would negatively affect their chances of promotion although men are entitled to two weeks statutory paternity leave at a week of men did not take it with most saying they would have liked to the most common reason was because the fathers felt they could not afford to dr katherine rake chief executive of the family and parenting institute said this is a very timely report it reminds us that parenting is about more than mothers fathers want to spend more time with their children and they are facing the same issues about how to balance work and family life as mothers the report finds there is still a wide gulf between an aspiration to share responsibilities for children and the practical division of labour although fathers express egalitarian views in practice most still work fulltime and their partners provide the bulk of childcare within the family it says campaigners for better flexible working opportunities for mothers said these were familiar concerns justine roberts cofounder of online parenting network mumsnet said welcome to our world yes your career prospects do get materially impaired by wanting to put your family first and thats something women have been wrestling with for years but roberts welcomed any growth in pressure from fathers for flexible working because she said this would ultimately reduce the strain on women unless men start thinking about this the culture will never change she said once fathers also start demanding flexible working it will make it easier for women to get it at the moment employers think of women as a potential burden because they worry they will want flexible conditions it will be helpful for women and their prospects once men are also seen as likely to demand flexible working becky sibert policy officer at families need fathers welcomed the report she said it is clear the governments approach for supporting balancing work and childcare commitments is outdated we know from our experience that fathers want to spend more time with their families and that policy doesnt support this we support the ehrc report which expands paternity and parental leave schemes anne madden an ehrc policy adviser said one solution for enabling women to spend more time at work would be to allow fathers to spend more time with their children the leader of the liberal democrats nick clegg said he empathised with the portrait of men battling to reconcile professional and family commitments like most parents miriam and i are both constantly trying to juggle long hours at work with trying to spend as much time as possible with our kids he said it is about time that fathers struggling to combine work and family life get the same level of attention as mothers do

the next years is going to be a period of radical change for britains fathers according to a major report that predicts more and more men will be living apart from their children and struggling to spend time with them for men already trying to cope with family lives dramatically different from those of their own fathers the shifts ahead will leave a whole generation trying to parent without a road map said dr katherine rake new chief executive of the family and parenting institute fpi the organisations research report family trends points to changing attitudes among men and changing demands from working women which have led to a rise in the number of fathers now trying to spend more time playing and interacting with their children a trend which is set to increase but with far more fathers expected to be living apart from their children in the future because of divorce or separation men will have to make more effort if they want to be a significant part of their childrens lives mothers have been at the forefront of social change over the last few decades as they have moved in unprecedented numbers into paid work but in the next decade it will be men said rake who will unveil the research at the organisations th anniversary conference tomorrow she said politicians should support men in their desire to spend more time with their children whats emerging from the data we have is the increasing expectation for dads to be taking a more active role with their children but they will be doing that within much more complex circumstances just as the notion of fatherhood is itself becoming more complex with separation and stepfamilies and all the rest of the new models of family life she told the observer what we dont know is how men are going to respond it remains to be seen if men can adapt to that shift over the next decade as well as women have over the past years cohabitation has doubled in the past decade and is expected to continue to rise to an estimated of couples by and the number of people who will never marry is also rising steadily with statistics suggesting that of cohabiting relationships into which children are born currently break up it is a picture of more and more broken families and extended stepfamilies other findings in the research show families are getting smaller couples are having children later and of mothers will be working in factors which mean fathers are more likely to be involved with their kids fathers who are lone parents account for just of all families with children and of single parents and the dad who raises his children alone is still a rare phenomenon our report poses a challenge to central and local government said rake health education and family services are going to have to look at how they support fathers roles within families from the time things start going wrong to the time when fathers are in danger of losing contact policymakers cannot fall into the trap of investing large sums of money trying to reverse the tide of trends by trying to encourage more traditional families nor will parents allow them to fall back on old assumptions which have meant mothers carrying the burden of changing families and parenting demands we have to make sure fathers arent overlooked any more they havent got a clear route map through this social upheaval and are going to need support of course that will often have to come from their female partners but despite these trends and the expectations from women of increasing equality in their relationship we have to remember we are a very long way away from achieving equality in childcare women are still carrying the load,2009-11,next year going period radical change britain father according major report predicts men living apart child

ahead of the publication of the governments domestic violence strategy today a groundbreaking report has called for much more specialised support for victims of domestic violence a study by the hestia fund a womens charity of women facing the most severe forms of domestic abuse found that more than had been strangled or choked said they feared they would be killed and more than one in said their abuser had threatened to kill the children threequarters did not live with their abuser proving that leaving the perpetrator is no guarantee of safety however relatively cheap but targeted support services could make these women much safer the charity found the report which the authors claim is the largest study of outcomes for victims of domestic abuse in europe found that twothirds of women suffering the most extreme physical emotional and sexual abuse said the abuse ceased following intensive support from independent domestic violence advisers idvas idvas act as the main interface between victims and the public sector coordinating services from the police courts housing childrens services the nhs and other services to help keep women safe researchers evaluated idva services across england and wales and found more than threequarters of women using those services had suffered high levels of abuse for an average of fiveandahalf years more than twothirds had children who were being put at risk of harm but support from idvas significantly improved the womens safety the study found of the women studied said they felt safer reported a total cessation of abuse after tailored support from these advisers while the number of those suffering severe and multiple forms of abuse plummeted from of the sample to and only felt their children were at risk of harm the government has said it wants idvas which were formally introduced in to be in place nationally by april but so far these services are not widely used and many face cutbacks the report calculates that there are less than half the services needed for national coverage without idvas victims of domestic violence have to try and piece together the support they need on their own said diana barran chief executive of the charity coordinated action against domestic abuse and one of the authors of the report a single severe wounding would incur in costs to the criminal justice system and in costs to the nhs she said in contrast idvas cost less than per person she added the potential savings to government could run into hundreds of millions of pounds she concluded unfortunately however these services remain fragmented and in line with many other domestic abuse services severely underfunded a home office spokesperson said violence against women and girls ruins lives breaks up families and has a lasting impact across the generations much has been done over recent years to improve support for women and this report shows that independent domestic violence advisers are really making a difference

teenage perpetrators of domestic violence are to be targeted by the government in a hardhitting awareness campaign that reflects concern about physical abuse meted out by the young the move part of the governments violence against women and girls strategy highlights fears that if people under commit domestic violence it will become the norm for them in later life research by the nspcc reveals that a third of teenage girls in a relationship suffer an unwanted sexual act a quarter of girls also suffer physical violence such as being slapped punched or beaten by their boyfriend the campaign which will start in the new year is aimed at both sexes and aims to challenge what the home office claims are pervasive attitudes among teens violence against women and girls shatters lives and has a lasting impact across generations said the home secretary alan johnson it is vital that we challenge the troubling and persistent attitudes among some teenagers that violence in relationships is ever justified catching them in their first relationships before these views become entrenched should help to prevent violence the campaign which will be supported in schools and carried on television aims to ensure that girls understand they do not have to tolerate any form of violence or controlling behaviour it will help young people understand what constitutes abusive behaviour in a relationship by covering a range of messages from physical violence through to being pressured to have sex the campaign will be unveiled on wednesday international day for the elimination of violence against women and will be included alongside a range of measures involving the police councils the nhs and government it comes as new research suggests that three quarters of police forces are insufficiently trained to tackle domestic abuse freedom of information foi requests made to england and waless police forces have revealed substantial inconsistencies in how domestic violence victims are treated forces were asked about budgets training staffing and operational structures their responses revealed substantial regional differences the foi requests found at least different ways in which police forces classified a domestic abuse incident in almost one force in incidents are not logged as domestic abuse unless the offence is a violent crime only of forces providing specialist domestic abuse training more than fourfifths of the forces questioned work with independent domestic violence advisers and domestic abuse coordinators who are widely recognised as the most valuable members of a domestic abuse unit but in some cases there was only one of these serving regions with populations of even in the beststaffed force there was just one adviser or coordinator per members of the public last week the association of chief police officers proposed a domestic violence register to track the estimated men in england and wales who move from one relationship to another serially abusing their partners but liquidlogic which builds computer systems for the police said the foi results suggested the register should not be the priority a complete overhaul is needed if we are to achieve

harriet harmans plans to extend maternity leave have sparked the predictable hysteria theres a website called harrietharmansuckscom and her cabinet colleague lord mandelson with whom she reportedly has a chilly relationship has toned down her initial proposals now the new issue of prospect magazine carries a more nuanced response from lse academic catherine hakim added maternity leave would not only be bad for employers and british business hakim says but would actually harm women in work too familyfriendly policies have actually been the cause of the glass ceiling for women not the solution she writes her case is a persuasive one and it has gained a lot of currency in the past few months a recent daily mail headline for an article by vogue editor alexandra shulman said it all yearlong maternity leave flexi hours four day weeks why would any boss hire a woman far from extending maternity leave currently anywhere between one to months we should be cutting it back this is the only way to make women more equal at work as it would make them less of a risky hire for male employers or so the argument goes yet on closer examination how many of the socalled negative effects of generous maternity leave are truly harmful according to hakim evidence that around threequarters of women who return to work after maternity leave go parttime or find other flexible terms is troubling why isnt this rather an encouraging sign that a majority of mothers are able to strike a healthy worklife balance not all women or mens top ambition is to be a chief executive plus harmans plans do not include compulsory maternity leave any woman who wants to hop out of her hospital bed and straight back into the office is still free to do so as she should be gaby hinsliffs moving account of her decision to quit the observer underscored just how emotive this subject can be but one can also level it down to very basic practical terms if we cut back on maternity leave how will working mothers be able to exclusively breastfeed for six months as the world health organisation recommends plenty choose not to breastfeed for many good reasons though surely a mother should at least have this option with all its proven health benefits and still be able to keep her job you could win this side of the argument purely on nhs costeffectiveness grounds of course every work and domestic situation is unique and certain jobs can never truly be made familyfriendly but this makes an even stronger case for a change in the law women are entitled to these familyunfriendly jobs too and so the rules should better accommodate the involvement of both parents in childrearing which is why laudable though they are harmans plans dont go far enough in their manifesto labour promised up to six months paternity leave for all fathers a proposal they have now backed away from thanks to again alleged interference from the prince of darkness to be fair surveys carried out in sweden showed that before a policy of generous paternity leave was introduced a majority of swedish men and women were against it but just because a working father doesnt want to be more involved in the daytoday parenting of a small child does this mean he should automatically be allowed to opt out as things stand women certainly cant and surely if employment laws are to have any point at all they should discourage reductive gender roles a majority of swedish women may have been against mandatory leave before it was introduced but i wonder how many object to it now plus as richard reeves has pointed out in the observer there are plenty of british fathers who do crave more time with their children and a fairer allocation of parenting options one of the things that happen all too often in this debate is that men are reduced to boorish irresponsible stereotypes often by wellintending women arguing passionately for equality harriet harman is right to push for more generous maternity leave for those who want it but it should

police chiefs have proposed a domestic violence register to track an estimated men in england and wales who move from one relationship to another serially abusing their partners the association of chief police officers acpo is also pressing for the creation of a course of conduct offence that would enable prosecutions to be brought against serial offenders even if the evidence is insufficient in each individual case the police say a register of serial abusers would allow new partners and others at risk of violence to be told of a mans history controversially this could include information short of convictions including a pattern of unproved allegations by different women the register of serial domestic violence abusers would differ from the sex offenders register in that conviction alone would not automatically lead to inclusion decisions about disclosure to potential victims would be taken by a multiagency panel that would assess the risks in each case the package of police proposals to deal with serial perpetrators of violence against women and girls was drawn up in response to a request from jacqui smith in march when she was home secretary a policing crime and security bill is expected to include another proposal from the acpo review group for the introduction of domestic violence protection orders these would ban a suspected violent partner from returning to the family home or having any contact for days brian moore the chief constable of wiltshire who carried out the acpo review said it was necessary to ensure that the police were doing all they could to protect victims and the public from dangerous people who had repeatedly shown violent tendencies we want to go after those serial perpetrators who go from relationship to relationship growing in confidence and menace he said moore admitted that the proposed course of conduct offence would be a radical departure in criminal law and had polarised the reviews steering committee with some members vehemently opposed he said he recognised that the proposals were controversial and required further consultation it is for government to take into account the wider perspectives as part of its full consultation the acpo review report says the register of serial perpetrators would not be generally accessible to the public but its details would be made known to potential victims on a needtoknow basis we consider it important for the safety and wellbeing of individual members of the public who are in a relationship with a dangerous person that the potential victim has the right to know about relevant information so that informed choices about personal safety can be made is one of the reviews conclusions information made available would include police records of previous allegations against a man and the outcome of those plus cautions and convictions a pilot scheme is under way involving selective disclosure of details on the sex offenders register the police estimate of serial perpetrators of violence against domestic partners is based on returns from of the police forces in england and wales serial perpetrators were defined as those responsible for domestic violence involving two or more victims the home secretary alan johnson said the proposals would stimulate an important debate work is already under way to implement one recommendation in the form of domestic violence protection orders or go orders which will be an extremely useful tool for police to protect victims he said we will now carefully consider how other recommendations can be taken forward and set out our proposed approach alongside the violence against women and girls strategy later this year in numbers one in four women will experience domestic violence according to the british crime survey domestic violence accounts for of all violent incidents reported to the police on average two women a week are killed by a partner or former partner in england and wales women who are abused by

i never knew that being punched so hard in the head that i was knocked to the floor was domestic abuse i never knew that being grabbed shouted at glared at and spat at in my face was being bullied i didnt know that being kicked repeatedly until my legs collapsed beneath me was abuse i never knew that being driven in a car so fast i felt i was going to die was a control tactic to scare me to let me know who was boss it is seven years since i left a physically and emotionally abusive relationship and i still find it difficult to forget what happened to me a woman is assaulted in her home every six seconds in the uk and one woman is killed every three days it is estimated that of women experience domestic violence in their lifetime and on average a woman is assaulted times before she seeks help police receive a complaint about domestic abuse every seconds i went on the freedom programme to find out why some men hit women and to find out if what had happened to me was my fault the week programme was created by pat craven author of living with the dominator which educates women about male violence on the programme you are taught how to recognise and name abusive behaviour you also learn about the beliefs held by abusive men i wanted to work out why i didnt leave as soon as the violence began instead i stayed until my boyfriend threatened to kill me although in a way i had reached the point at which i didnt care if he did kill me i just wanted the pain to stop i had lost all hope and i couldnt talk to anyone about the abuse being subjected to domestic abuse shattered my confidence and my sense of reality i lost a sense of my own judgment as he constantly told me it was my fault the physical abuse i experienced was traumatising and i was left with a mistrust of people even my own family and close friends i became isolated going on the freedom programme literally gave me the freedom to talk about the abuse i had kept hidden for so long without feeling judged or blamed it was a relief to hear other women say they too still struggled with anxiety following their experience of abuse i now know the reason why people stay in abusive relationships most of the time they think it is their fault because their thoughts actions and perceptions are being controlled i learned that domestic abuse is all about a desire to control never about anger and i am starting to understand that its never a victims fault at the last session we were taught about warning signs to look out for in a new relationship and i felt sick to my stomach if only i had known all this before then i could have saved myself a lot of pain and confusion as i would have had the knowledge and the confidence to leave at the first signs of abuse the freedom programme is now going into schools to give young girls information that could save their lives this article was amended on october to remove some personal information,2009-12,never knew punched hard head wa knocked floor wa domestic abuse

im pregnant but want promotion shall i tell them about the baby i work for a large manufacturing company and over the past five years have been rapidly promoted it is a very maledominated company but i have never found this to be an issue i am now ready for my next promotion and i have been asked to apply for a number of roles which are above my current level at the moment i have two job applications internally for roles i would really enjoy however i am pregnant this was a planned pregnancy and i dont think it should change my job prospects my husband will give up work to look after our child and i will be the sole provider so the promotion plus the extra cash would be very useful however i know how it will be viewed if just after i get a new job i tell them im off for months on maternity leave even though my maternity leave would be quite short logically i think i should keep quiet but emotionally i want to be honest and apply with the full facts known i worry that this could affect my chances and that if i dont get the job after telling the truth then i will resent the company and blame my pregnancy for my failure on top of all this i am less than weeks pregnant and i am reluctant to say anything yet as it is still not really safe to do so do you think i should i tell my employer this is an agonisingly difficult question im fairly sure that whatever advice i give there will be readers with widely varying experiences who will have widely varying views so let me tiptoe very gingerly into this potential minefield the key starting point for me is that youre less than weeks pregnant and so quite understandably dont want to go public about it yet you shouldnt and you neednt as you almost certainly know youre not required to inform your employer about your pregnancy until the end of the th week before the week of the expected birth so wait i suspect a lot depends on your relationship with your immediate boss it seems highly likely that he thinks well of you as do others in your company youve been rapidly promoted over a period of time and are currently being encouraged to apply for even more senior roles if youre comfortable with the relationship i suggest you confide in him explain your dilemma as you have to me because its still so early youre applying for these two jobs without revealing that youre pregnant its a precious private fact and you want it to stay that way for the time being im sure hell understand then tell him that after the birth your husband plans to give up work to look after your child so that you can quite responsibly return to your own job without too disruptive a maternity leave from this it should be absolutely clear to him that youre as committed as anyone could be to your career you cant of course expect him to advise you on what to do and he may not be at all involved in the selection process for these two new roles but i suspect youll feel better for having confided in someone and you may well get a better feel for how to play things but i still find it disturbing that people in your position have to choose between absolute openness with the attendant risks and deliberate if entirely legal concealment my instinct is that your company values you highly enough for you to go for absolute openness but if thats the route you choose and youre then not offered a new job youll have to live with an uncomfortable uncertainty i wish i could be more definitive restructuring means i have to apply for a new role but i want to retire my local government department is being restructured a day consultation period started on october there are senior and middle management posts at risk with fewer posts in the proposed structure meaning some staff will be put on to redeployment this can mean redundancy after a further days i would prefer redundancy as i do not want to go through a slotting incompetitive process for one of the new posts i will be in the spring and am willing to retire early however my boss has said that opting not to be slotted into a new post is a resignation and it looks as if we will all be made to apply and be interviewed this will be followed by demotion or redeploymentredundancy for those unsuccessful at that stage although willing to be retired earlymade redundant i am not willing to resign and walk away with nothing after a lengthy career in this service is there any leverage in asking again for redundancy prior to the slotting in this would leave one more post for colleagues to be slotted into and enable me to move on with redundancy pay and without the stress of competing for a post i do not want the elaborate process that restructuring organisations seem obliged to go through is presumably intended to ensure not only fairness but evidence of fairness but it so often generates months of doubt and insecurity i can understand why you shrink at the thought of putting yourself through a lengthy process for one of these new posts when youd much prefer to take early retirement or to be made redundant so i would recommend that you again make this preference clear to your boss in the need to be seen to treat everyone equally your department may be reluctant to set a precedent by acceding to one persons request but your argument that such a move would open up an extra opportunity for a colleague is a powerful one concentrate on that rather than on the advantages to yourself and theres a reasonable chance that theyll see it makes their own job just a little bit easier you certainly shouldnt resign for jeremy bullmores advice onawork issue send a brief email todearjeremytheguardiancom please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or reply personally readers response i have read your correspondence about employers asking job applicants to provide detailed personal health information dear jeremy december last august i was contacted by a former colleague in local government desperate for help after the council she works for lost its media officer at an hours notice i was working freelance and she asked me to come in immediately i agreed to start work the following week but made it plain i would not be an applicant for the post three weeks later i received a questionnaire from the hr department with more than questions about my health history and that of my family including whether or not i had ever tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease ever had heavy periods or constipation or diarrhoea i was asked if any relatives had ever had a stroke a heart attack angina diabetes glaucoma or high blood pressure the form did not specify how close or remote these relatives should be my paternal grandmother died when she was thrown from her horse and my paternal grandfather died of a broken heart a little later my mother died soon after suffering a series of strokes at the age of might they have been relevant i declined to fill in the form pointing out that i had been invited to help out and that i would not be stopping more than a few weeks i was told i still had to fill in the form to which i responded that they needed me more than i needed them a message came back that i could ignore the form i queried this whole approach with the tuc and with unison i have to say that neither organisation was very knowledgeable or helpful i wholly endorse your response to the

recently my life has been ruled by a tyrannical little man hes relentless in telling me whenever i fall short ive come to dread the sight of him i ought to explain the little man doesnt really exist he lives inside my new gps training watch where he races against another little man who is meant to represent me every time i look he informs me just how sluggish i am with his infuriating refrain of you are minutes behind guess what i know im a woman im supposed to run a home be on top of my job and look halfway decent im at least minutes behind for everything and thats on a good day maybe some men like the element of competition and goading but if that watch had been designed by a woman for a female runner the little man would be toast instead there would be a chic little woman saying well done you have used up calories now you can eat a cake not all men are this bad at understanding women some are past masters at female psychology stuart rose at marks amp spencer has a keen instinct for his target market as does philip green at topshop asda boss andy bond knows exactly how to appeal to mums on a budget but beyond traditional areas such as fashion and food there are still sectors where little if any thought seems to be given to female purchasers the running business is a case in point although i see at least as many women as men on my circuits of londons clapham common most of the kit is maleoriented a lot of female gear is just a scaleddown version of a blokes you have to pay a fortune for a garment that is flattering functional and doesnt come in a noxious shade of yellow energy drinks and gels have macho names such as hammer maxim and torque why were not in the sas were only going for a jog sometimes womanblindness crosses the line from the irritating to the damaging take pensions personal plans are routinely designed and sold on the unspoken assumption that the investor is male this myopia is a major reason why many women will end up with inadequate incomes when they retire the marketing does not address a key barrier for women the fact that many mothers perceive saving for their retirement to be selfish a report by scottish widows this year found that women place a low priority on their own financial security and feel obliged to put spending on their childrens needs first the marketing might be more persuasive if it stressed the point that a pension means mothers are less likely to be a burden on their kids in later life seeing the world through female eyes can be good for business take handbags if a woman has her bag stolen from her car her loss is likely to amount to several hundred pounds but many standard car policies wouldnt cover the full amount there are now plans aimed at women drivers with special handbag cover written in even the notoriously laddish brewing industry remember tennents lager lovelies has woken up to the potential of the female consumer coors for instance set up an initiative called project eve to find out how to appeal to female drinkers male cluelessness can be funny and endearing but i cant help seeing that horrid homunculus in my watch as a mascot for mindless manthink smart men and smart companies make it their business to find out what makes women tick,2009-12,recently life ha ruled tyrannical little man relentless telling whenever fall short ive come dread sight ought explain little man doesnt really
