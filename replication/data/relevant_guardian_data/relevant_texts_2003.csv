daycare trust which compiled the survey of the costs of nurseries childminders and afterschool clubs said the rising bills threatened the success of the governments childcare strategy the typical cost of a nursery place for a child under two is now a week or more than a year up from last year the survey shows this compares with the average weekly household income of in parts of the country particularly london and the southeast the cost of a nursery place is much higher typically a week in inner london or more than a year with some parents paying much more parents in the uk pay threequarters of the cost of child care with the government paying most of the rest plus a small contribution by employers in most other european countries parents foot just of the bill the daycare trust says the high cost of childcare in britain is a key reason why only of parents with dependent children use formal childcare services all the time the director of the daycare trust stephen burke said parents need more financial help towards childcare costs to enable them to work and to give their children a good start in life the government should improve the childcare tax credit and do more to encourage employers to help their staff with childcare costs affordable childcare for all is crucial to achieving many of the governments policies from ending child poverty to raising educational attainment rosemary murphy who is chief executive of the national day nurseries association added we are urging the government to give more careful thought to how it can support parents with the cost of childcare and give employers greater incentives to support the childcare costs of their staff the education minister cathy ashton said the government wanted to improve access to affordable high quality childcare we are giving financial help to low and middle income families to pay for childcare and are funding free early education for all fouryearolds and soon all threeyearolds she added this government has spent an unprecedented amount on supporting working parents with m a day now spent on supporting parents with childcare costs she said that since the government had created new childcare places for almost million children by this would grow to places for more than million children she claimed,2003-01,parent britain pay highest childcare bill europe according national survey

husbands who claim their partners nagging or infidelity drove them to kill will face much tougher sentences under a government shakeup of socalled crimes of passion ministers are secretly reviewing the defence of provocation which has its origins in the bygone tradition of men fighting duels under which a defendant can evade a murder charge by arguing that their victim did or said something that made them lose control ministers argue that it reflects a medieval view of marriage in which a man whose honour is insulted by a domineering or unfaithful wife is entitled to fatal revenge rather than a divorce it also encourages defendants to blacken the victims name in court painting her as a bad wife the review will prompt impassioned debate over modern relationships with critics likely to argue that men instinctively respond differently than women to infidelity and that feminising the law is unfair this defence institutionalises the blaming of the victim i killed her but it was all her fault and we say we are going to put the victim at the heart of the crim inal justice system said a whitehall source we put a high value on human life and have high standards of responsibility times have changed we dont have duels and we dont see mens ownership of their wives in the same way the provocation defence cannot secure a killers acquittal but reduces the charge from murder carrying a life sentence to manslaughter with a much shorter or even suspended sentence solicitorgeneral harriet harman home secretary david blunkett and the lord chancellors department are still discussing the reforms leading options include scrapping the provocation defence altogether understood to be harmans preference or strictly limiting the circumstances in which provocation could be claimed making clear that sexual jealousy is not enough ministers are also studying the us system of homicide counts under which different grades of murder carry different tariffs the review follows the case of madeleine humeswho was killed by her husband les a solicitor after she confessed to an affair with her karate instructor the court heard last year how their teenage daughter tried to seize the knife from humes as he repeatedly stabbed her mother humes who said in court he just saw this red mist got seven years for manslaughter leaving his wifes family furious if madeleine had survived and he had been charged only with attempted murder or gbh he would have got more of a sentence than that says paula watt madeleines sister but he killed her so he gets less what kind of signal is that sending to people all the way through les was seen as a victim maddie wasnt heard at all home office research on homicides found that women were much more likely to be killed by a husband or lover than a stranger one of the most dangerous flashpoints is a woman leaving the relationship even if as in the humeses case the marriage was not previously known to be violent using the defence requires defendants to show it was reasonable given their character for them to have responded by killing but there is little definition of what counts as provocation we call it the nagging and shagging defence classically it will be either she was sleeping with someone else or that she nagged him said solicitor harriet wistrich of campaign group justice for women but if it is simply that she is leaving you is that enough of an excuse for murder several women who have killed abusive partners famously sara thornton have claimed provocation arguing that they snapped after years of putting up with domestic violence but ministers believe these cases could be covered by extending the law on self defence to cover cases where the woman was not responding to an immediate attack but was still effectively killing to save herself highprofile cases involving provocation include joseph mcgrail who walked free in with a suspended sentence for kicking his wife to death after pleading provocation on the grounds that she was an alcoholic and swore at him the judge said the dead woman would have tried the patience of a saint,2003-01,husband claim partner nagging infidelity drove kill face much

britains fathers are to blame for failing to ask for more flexible working practices and adhering to a longhours culture the confederation of british industry said yesterday as a report claimed the countrys work culture stops men spending more time caring for their children susan anderson director of human resource policy at the cbi said employers recognised they needed to offer flexible hours but that it was up to fathers to call for this men still see themselves as the main breadwinners she said and while employers are equally open to requests for more flexibility from men as women the truth of the matter is they originate more from women but the charity fathers direct insisted fathers were too scared to ask for increased flexibility in a culture in which fathers work the longest hours in europe with one in eight spending hours a week in the office young fathers need to feel very secure in their careers and they believe that asking for flexibility is seen as a lack of commitment which makes them more vulnerable said a spokesman jack osullivan theres a different culture around worklife benefits for women its more legitimised for female workers to work parttime for instance but men are scared to ask for this the debate arose as the equal opportunities commission published its report working fathers earning and caring which found fathers of children under five spend more than two hours a day looking after their youngsters compared with just minutes a generation ago but that they would do more if they were offered increased flexibility the research which incorporates an analysis of a government survey of employees and a second of employers confirms that traditional gender roles still exist with of fathers working fulltime compared with of mothers and twofifths of fathers still working more than hours a week the maximum specified under the eu working time directive with the increase in mothers returning to work fathers are increasingly handson in the provision of childcare but such daily provision decreases for fathers who work plus hours a week a quota worked by fewer than of mothers such fathers then make up for the time away from their families at the weekend but while fathers are displaying revolutionary behaviour in combining the roles of both breadwinner and caregiver just opt to work parttime compared with of mothers while only make use of flexitime and jobshare crucially twothirds of fathers believe working parttime would affect their career progression compared with of mothers fathers expectations of whether their employers will offer worklife balance practices are low an expectation often matched by the reality with promotion of familysensitive policies variable and only threefifths of employers compared with fourfifths of workers supporting the idea of worklife balance the research comes just before the introduction in april of statutory paternity leave and a workplace standard which will enable parents of children under six to ask for flexible working practices though there will be no compulsion for the employer to grant them last night the reports coauthor margaret obrien of the university of east anglia described the introduction of paid paternity leave as a catalyst for a national debate about how fathers balance their economic and emotional commitments to children and partners julie mellor

new parents could get more time off work and further financial assistance under proposals presented today by senior cabinet ministers the plans were unveiled by the chancellor gordon brown and the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt as they highlighted familyfriendly measures already due for introduction in april mr brown and ms hewitt launched a document balancing work and family life enhancing choice and support for parents which said the government will examine the case for extending the period of paid paternity leave andor introduce unpaid paternity leave under plans announced previously by mr brown as of april this year fathers will be entitled to two weeks statutory paternity pay in addition ministers will consider whether to extend paid paternity leave in cases of multiple births and disabled children since december parents have been entitled to weeks unpaid parental leave to be taken in a childs first five years which can be taken in blocks of up to four weeks a year ministers will now consider the case for allowing parents to use all that leave in one block at the end of maternity paternity or adoption leave the government will also consider whether to allow fathers time off to attend antenatal classes in other moves ministers will also consider allowing a mother on paid maternity leave to claim help with childcare costs for a new child in order to settle that child into childcare before the mother returns to work the proposals were outlined as mr brown and ms hewitt sought to highlight the financial assistance which will be available to a large number of families with the introduction in april of the child tax credit and working tax credit mr brown said for most people the combination of tax credits and child benefit would provide assistance of a week for a first child he emphasised that the tax credits would be paid direct to mothers aprils new tax credits are the biggest financial boost for mothers since the introduction of child benefit and evidence shows that money paid direct to mothers is more likely to be spent on the child than if it goes to fathers up to bn will be transferred from dads to mums for their children we want to put families first by helping parents as they do the most important and difficult job of all getting their children off to a good start in life mr brown cited an icm poll which found that twothirds of people believe that all support for children should be paid to the mother and only believe it should be paid to the father asked whether the increase in national insurance contributions due in april would effectively wipe out the benefit to flow from tax credits mr brown said many families even after the national insurance rise as the result of the improvements in child support will be better off and of course people will be paying towards a better health service and i believe when people see the new investment that is taking place in the nhs then they will see the benefit of these changes,2003-01,new parent could get time work financial assistance proposal presented today senior cabinet minister plan unveiled chancellor gordon brown trade industry secretary patricia

help raise his children but finds that society now accepts such an attitude more readily mr baker said fifteen years ago it really wasnt the thing at least in the north of england where i lived then for men to be closely involved in child care men drew the curtains when they needed to change a childs nappy now it is an acceptable thing for men to do its acceptable to be seen pushing a pram or spending time with your children in the playground he was pleased more facilities were provided for men and babies for example i found i didnt have to gatecrash womens toilets in search of changing facilities but he still encounters some prejudice when i went to antenatal classes before the birth of my third and fourth children i found that i was treated as if i was an incompetent male when in fact i probably knew more than most because i had been there before but it is in the workplace where mr baker a senior lecturer in social policy at the university of brighton says men face most difficulties many employers do not give fathers enough time off i think it is particularly true of senior positions executives are expected to be prepared to work all hours and fly abroad at a moments notice fathers need to be encouraged to spend more time with children contact with children enhances life for both parents and children those who miss out miss out on the richest part of human life

fathers carry out a third of all childcare in the uk according to a report to be published today from the equal opportunities commission the surprise findings have prompted julie mellor chair of the eoc to call for a new debate on the role of fatherhood the role of british fathers is changing fast and we need to negotiate that new role at home at work and in terms of government policy ms mellor says in an interview with the guardian the eocs report working fathers earning and caring found that the time men spend with their children has increased from less than minutes a day in the mids to two hours on the average weekday by the late s at weekends it is significantly more averaging around six and a half hours each day according to ms mellor the findings mean that the uk needs a shift in the culture which actually legitimises mens roles so that they feel more confident to ask for flexibility at work at present men have low expectations of securing worklife balance practices and still see themselves as the main breadwinner with of them saying that work makes it difficult to fulfil their family duties men feel they are forced to work longer hours to provide for their children but its not what they want to do they want flexibility says ms mellor from april the government is introducing a workplace standard which will enable parents of children under six to ask their employers for flexible working practices though there will be no compulsion on the employer to grant them ms mellor wants the standard extended to parents of older children and will be watching the uptake among men preempting objections from employers that such measures would increase costs for businesses the eoc has surveyed employers who have introduced flexible working practices research showed that eight out of employers felt they fostered good employment relations and twothirds agreed they improved staff motivation although believed they increased overall costs nine out of who had implemented such

placing leaflets in gp surgeries spelling out the horrors of domestic violence is not the best way to help women leave abusive partners according to janet jackson many children think its the norm for their dad to hit their mum or sister says the year old mother of two what we need are workshops in schools telling girls and boys that its wrong only then can we break that cycle of violence this was her first piece of advice to the east birmingham forum on domestic violence whose management committee she joined a few months ago as the only board member who is a survivor of domestic violence she knows firsthand how difficult it is to leave an abusive relationship its not that easy to get out she says you feeled trapped in a spiders web your selfesteem and confidence are broken like a shattered vase you feel hopeless what finally gave jackson the strength to leave was the support she received from waits women acting in todays society a birminghambased community organisation she was put in touch with by the police after she tried to commit suicide she developed a close friendship with her waits domestic violence development worker who provided practical advice as well as emotional support i didnt want to move in to a hostel but joanna went with me to see it first which really helped says jackson shes always there for me day and night waits combination of onetoone training counselling and advocacy has gradually helped jackson to rebuild her confidence over the last year to the point where she is now setting up a survivors group for other black and minority ethnic women in her community actively contributes to the domestic violence forum and is a vocal member of waits planning committee i always wanted to have a voice but waits gave me the courage and faith in myself to believe that i have got something important to say she says it is this type of community leadership and participation that the government is anxious to foster rhetorically encouraging local people to take a lead in transforming their neighbourhoods is at the heart of its strategy to tackle social exclusion but while ministers recognise that grassroots organisations such as waits are often best placed to nurture local peoples skills and talents a report published today by thinktank demos argues that its policies are actually underming community groups ability to deliver the demands and expectations of central and local government with their strict performance criteria emphasis on quantitative outputs and formal participatory structures such as local strategic partnerships all act against community projects achieving their aims according to demos these groups are often motivated by political or moral values and see empowering people as their main priority not delivering government polices says helen mccarthy author of the report inside out rethinking inclusive communities if the government really trusts communitybased organisations then it has to recognise that they are not conventional service providers the report assesses the role played by independent grassroots organisations in building capacity building and leadership in local communities researchers surveyed more than community projects funded by the barrow cadbury trust an independent trust that commissioned the study to help it use its m annual grants provision more effectively respondents raised concerns that government was more interested in coopting them than allowing them to do what they are good at as a result many refused to accept financial support from statutory bodies for fear it would compromise their independence the local authority does not help community partnership it tries to determine and direct them said one community leader surveyed this is a view borne out by the community and council infighting that has dogged the governments new deal for communities ndc programme since its launch in a significant number of the projects across the country aimed at reviving britains poorest areas by giving local people the chance to devise their own solutions to the problems of their neighbourhood have run into trouble over allegations of government and council interference only last month britains leading tenant body was sacked from advising residents about a ndc scheme in kilburn north london tenant participation advisory service chief executive phil morgan comments the new deal was meant to be about working with communities not about imposing topdown solutions anita guy a waits trustee says government is purporting to be doing something about social exclusion but it has got to be people and organisations doing it independently for themselves she acknowledges the difficulties organisations like hers pose for funders we facilitiate people to do the things they want to do she explains if a funder asks us what we will do with their money all we can guarantee is that well involve a number of women who are not currently involved in their community we cant say how many meetings were going to have or what exact issues well be tackling because it depends what the women want to do but we do know that we will benefit them and the community suhvinder stubbs director of the barrow cadbury trust believes there is a need for fewer initiatives a simplified funding regime and more flexible local structures government is not playing to the strengths of communitybased organisations she says inside out calls on the government to recognise that peoplebased rather than paperbased solutions are the way to tackle social exclusion to trust communitybased organisations more and to create what it calls a new middle ground that reconciles the professional culture of formal partnership structures with the culture of grassroots organisations stubbs sees a role here for independent trusts in bridging this gap but not until councils learn how to work with them they feel threatened and fearful of us she says they cant control us so they ignore us barbara roche minister for social exclusion who will speak about simplified funding streams at todays launch of the report accepts there are difficulties but insists that positive changes are taking place for community groups at local level there is a real readjustment of power for all of us and that takes time she says but community organisers argue that they have yet to see local and national goverment relinquish control and a more handsoff approach is still needed to put local people in the driving seat the report makes clear that local people supported by community based groups know whats best when it comes to tackling issues of which they have firsthand experience as jackson says i find a lot of what the domestic violence forum says is over my head they use a lot of long words but i can tell them what its like to be a victim of domestic violence inside out rethinking inclusive communities is available free at wwwdemoscouk,2003-02,placing leaflet gp surgery

since on average women are paid less than men it seems natural to assume that any legislation for fairer pay would benefit women rather than men natural assumptions have their limits however and a report from the institute for social and economic research at the university of essex comes to the surprising conclusion that men are more likely to benefit from new laws governing fixedterm contracts and temporary employment since last year employers have been obliged to treat shorttermcontract workers and permanent staff equally the same wages and benefits must be available to both similar legislation is in the pipeline for temporary workers in both cases it is men who have the biggest gap to close to catch up with their permanent colleagues there is no noticeable division of gender between fixedterm and permanent workers the same proportion of men as women work on fixedterm contracts but up to now men have had more to lose from shortterm employment women on shortterm contracts earn an average less than women on permanent contracts men on shortterm contracts earn less than if they were permanent men who temp fall even further behind earning less women who temp do less well than women in permanent employment by about the same margin the biggest difference between how men and women work is that far more women work parttime than men almost always because of family commitments over the past decade the proportion of men in parttime employment has edged up slightly but it is still only by contrast of women in the workforce are parttimers as it happens parttimers do not do badly when their wages are compared pro rata to fulltimers earning between and less this disparity alone is not enough to explain the massive gap between mens and womens average earnings at best estimate but parttimers by nature are not always available to do overtime and overtime is one definite factor in the disparity the other is gender division of jobs the male it contractor may do less well than his permanent colleagues but he still does better than a teacher,2003-02,since average woman paid less men seems natural assume legislation fairer pay would benefit woman rather men

council policies under government direction focus on the poorer parts of enfield in edmonton and ponders end in the poorer areas affordable full daycare is in short supply but nursery classes two

schools in care but stops well short of suggesting every primary should be involved parents must have a choice of care she says at rainham the nursery is part of the school ms rollins manages the childcare staff but on a separate budget care is available from am until pm fees are meanstested and start at a week a working couple might pay the maximum our struggle is for space she says this school ranges from early years to and our classrooms are used for something all the time staffing is not the issue but space including play space kids have to cross the north circular road to find anywhere green to play as if to answer ms rollins labour is about to roll out its childrens centres the of wards in england which are most deprived are to get special help with childcare and health and social services in enfield it looks as though five wards will be involved in addition to the two already in sure start whitehall guidance is eagerly awaited and due shortly enfield borough will be in charge but the budget will be administered by a special unit inside the dfes and only be released if civil servants are satisfied with what the borough proposes so far no one seems very clear what the centres will involve they are supposed to bring childcare together with support for parents and local primary care trusts and will probably be based on primary schools they could be a watereddown

the bizarre onoff tussle within the family behind the berkeley group building business seemed to have the makings of a reallife dynastystyle drama when it broke out last week tony k pidgley publicschool educated son of former barnardos boy tony senior founder of the empire announced he was planning a billion bid for his fathers business the initial publicity generated speculation about family disharmony and anger on the part of pidgley jnr over his fathers remarriage to a much younger woman but within hours pidgley jnr withdrew his tentative takeover offer and quashed suggestions of a family feud such public dramas are rare but whether they involve a powerful dynasty or a smallscale enterprise like a village shop or pub family firms can face conflicts and management dilemmas that need special handling a staggering per cent of all the businesses in the uk are family firms according to figures from the department of trade and industry theses businesses are such a large and vibrant part of the economy that the university of gloucester is now offering a parttime mba for family managers the first batch of students started the course last month and will learn how to manage conflict succession employment issues and growth the course is run in connection with kairos consulting a bristol company founded by john tucker who ran his own family business for seven years he says business relationships between relatives can often be fraught with difficulties succession planning is the major issue we deal with on a regular basis he says there can also be difficulties for nonfamily managers who are brought in to run the business but who still have to contend with family members who own it the attrition rate is extraordinarily high only about per cent of businesses stay in the family to the second generation and that drops to per cent by the time you reach the third generation the mba is a twoandahalfyear parttime course aimed to help second and thirdgeneration family business managers aside from business considerations most family firms tend to run relatively smoothly in the first generation an entrepreneur sets up the company and his or her spouse helps with the paper work the problems start when the son or daughter is expected to take up the reins sometimes the son lets call him jimmy does well when his father is running the business but there comes a time when he will have to go it alone says harry katz principal at financial adviser norwest consultants in middlesex the question is has jimmy got the skills and personality needed or is he just taking over because he is the son another problem is how the father reconciles his need for a retirement income with jimmys need to run a proper business there are occasions when the father takes a salary but doesnt work any more and jimmy is left with a millstone round his neck he may be working for a low salary on the promise of the business passing to him when the father dies he feels like it is slave labour and thats when resentment sets in says katz one of the options would be to buy out the fathers share of the business or to pay him dividends often however the fathers income in retirement depends heavily on how well his offspring run the business which means it is hard for him to stop meddling it is these issues that tucker tries to resolve for his clients the earlier you sort it out the better he says it can be very difficult for a son to accept that his father wants him to continue working at the firm under the direction of a new nonfamily managing director one issue often forgotten when entrepreneurs are building a business is the effect that their dedication can have on their young family tucker ran a training company from until but when he asked his children what life was like for them he got some surprising answers they told me about how the business was the only thing we talked about around the dinner table and why they would never go into a family

despite higher incomes better health and much greater opportunity for women britons are increasingly depressed unhappy in their relationships and alienated from civic society according to an exhaustive study to be published next week an analysis of the latest findings from three pioneering studies which have been following the lives of everyone born in england scotland and wales in one week in and more than people finds that britain is more classbound than ever before the study changing britain changing lives which has been passed to the guardian ahead of publication is the first to compare in detail the results of the three studies it identifies a society more fractured and individualistic but where people at the same time find their success wealth and opportunity dependent on family background to an even greater extent fourteen per cent of men born in were as likely to admit to depression and anxiety in compared with only of the group in for women the differences in the same years were almost as dramatic in and in of those born in of men and of women admitted to being unhappy with their first marriage in their early s compared with just of men and of women of those born in at the same age single people too were similarly much more likely to be unhappy with their lot the study coins the phrase sandwiched generation to describe how those born later stay in the family home for longer periods because of the rising cost of housing they also increasingly delay parenthood until their late s and early s at a point when their own parents become in need of support these later cohorts are thus increasingly likely to become sandwiched between the demands of the two adjacent generations and unlikely to enjoy the extended period of freedom from dependency enjoyed by adults in the past the study identifies a stunning transformation in family makeup and the growing fragility of personal relationships ninety per cent of women and of men among the group had become parents by the age of but this was true of only of men and of women among those born in of the group of fathers and of mothers when in their s were living with their own children among the group this was the case for just of fathers and of mothers the striking increase in women entering higher education and establishing themselves in the labour market has led to relationships and parenthood coming later threequarters of yearold women were in employment in compared with half of those aged in average female earnings were almost twice as high for yearolds born in than for those born in although most top jobs still went to men the growing financial independence of women also means that economic considerations were less likely to force them to remain in unhappy partnerships the authors also identify a greater preoccupation with personal happiness among those born later especially women in the latter half of the th century the economic and social role of marriage and family gave ground to its emotional aspects the study says this links with the rise of individualism in which relationships are seen less in terms of social responsibilities and obligations and more in terms of personal resources and fulfilment when competing demands of employment and domestic work put the relationship under further strain breakup may seem the only solution women transformed their position obtaining more higher qualifications and staying on in education longer than men by across both sexes the percentages gaining a degree quadrupled between the and groups while the proportions leaving with no qualifications plummeted from to but in education and employment class remained a dominant factor those at the bottom end of the socioeconomic scale manifested little evidence of the rising standards enjoyed by the majority the study says rising house prices put owneroccupation out of reach and relative poverty was increasing our findings give few grounds for optimism that these disparities are disappearing or even diminishing despite rising education levels and rising affluence across the three cohorts the old polarities based on social class appear if anything to be strengthening the study finds a dramatic drop in participation in local communities some of men born in were members of community and voluntary organisations in their s but only of those born in and just of those born in were voting has moved from a majority to a minority pastime more than of those born in and voted but just of those born in just of men and of women born in went to church in their s compared with

domestic violence is receiving little attention from the government because of concentration on street crime and gun violence it was claimed today the crime reduction charity nacro said in a report that this meant some of the most vulnerable people in society were not being properly protected the report calls for the development of better services to support women in their homes more services for children caught up in domestic violence and investment in education and prevention campaigns underlying causes of domestic violence such as overcrowded or poor housing poverty and unemployment must also be addressed it said nacro spokesman richard garside said the most vulnerable victims of violence are not always the most visible many violent crimes that are committed behind a closed door and in private have received little attention we need a shift in policy away from the assumption that every form of crime has a simple policing or criminal justice solution clearly a police officer in every living room is not the answer to domestic violence homelessness statistics show of homeless acceptances are due to relationship breakdown with domestic violence an issue in seven out of cases women and children fleeing violence in the home account for of those on local authorities homeless lists according to gvernment figures domestic violence accounts for around a quarter of all recorded

working parents face soaring bills for registered childcare according to a new survey from national charity daycare trust the research shows that the cost of nurseries childminders and afterschool clubs in england rose by almost last year this is on top of a increase reported for a fulltime nursery place for a child under two is now a week more than a year compared with in last years survey of childrens information services in england this compares with the average weekly gross household income of and average weekly spending on food and housing combined of the typical cost of a fulltime place with a registered childminder for a child under two is a little cheaper at a week while for children aged two and over a place costs a week on average at nurseries and with a childminder for older children hours a week at an after school club typically costs childcare costs vary in different parts of the country with nursery costs particularly expensive in london and the south east the costs are such that a working couple with for example a oneyearold and a threeyearold in fulltime nursery places and a sevenyearold attending an afterschool club during term time would face an annual childcare bill of if they lived in the northwest while their counterparts in the southeast would pay a year parents in britain pay threequarters of the cost of childcare with the government paying most of the rest plus a small contribution by employers the high cost of childcare is a key reason why only of parents with dependent children use formal childcare services all the time says daycare trust many have to rely instead on friends and family to care for their children according to the report access to quality childcare in the uk depends on family income the high cost of childcare faced by parents in this country the highest in europe means millions of children are missing out on the benefits of quality childcare with only one childcare place for every seven children under eight and growing numbers of women with young children in the workplace demand outstrips supply and is pushing up prices working families on lower incomes who get help towards their childcare bill through the childcare tax credit ctc still have to find at least of the cost of childcare the current average award through the ctc of a week is less than a third of the typical cost of a nursery place daycare trusts director stephen burke says parents are paying too high a price for childcare services which are as key to the wellbeing of our society as schools gps and transport families in most other european countries can access quality childcare in their local community at a price they can afford parents here need more financial help towards childcare costs to enable them to work and to give their children a good start in life daycare trust argues that unless more is done to pro vide affordable quality childcare for all families the governments fight to abolish child poverty and raise educational attainment will not succeed it is calling on the government to improve direct help to parents through the ctc by for example increasing the percentage of childcare expenses covered by the tax credit and increasing the level of childcare costs covered to reflect the real costs along with other childcare organisations it is also urging the government to encourage employers to provide more help by extending tax incentives for financial contributions towards the costs of childcare at present the law allows employers who provide a workplace nursery or contribute significantly to the management of a nursery to offer their staff taxfree childcare tha national childminding assocation ncma is calling on the government to give the same tax breaks to companies who invest in employer childminding networks formal groups of approved registered childminders who are recruited assessed and monitored by a network coordinator ncmas chief executive gill haynes says a lack of space and resources a widely spread workforce and an increase in the number of people working unsocial hours mean many organisations find an employer childminding network a more costeffective and parentfriendly option than a workplace nursery this is because childminders can offer care outside normal office hours can care for children of all ages so siblings can be looked after together usually live close to the familys home and can drop off and pick up from schools and playgroups giving companies who support employer childminding networks the same tax breaks as those who support workplace nurseries will says ms haynes level the playing field and mean that organisations are no longer penalised for favouring one form of childcare over another daycare trust runs a childcare helpline on for parents who can also visit wwwdaycaretrustorguk for information the ncma wwwncmaorguk runs a free information line it is holding a seminar the business case for childcare childminding networks deliver for

would you give up your job if you inherited and if you did carry on working would it change your attitude to work do not be too quick to assume these are hypothetical questions the number of people inheriting money or property is expected to grow substantially over the next few years youve now got secondgeneration homeowners benefiting from inheritances from firstgeneration homeowners says brett afsher of research organisation mintel millions of people will inherit significant amounts over the next few years figures from the official uk household survey suggest there are probably about five million pensioners who own their own homes since the average house is now worth nearly according to the nationwide building society this means billions of pounds of assets can be expected to pass to a fresh generation over the next decade or two inland revenue statistics show the estates of people who had died were notified for probate in but house price inflation and the growth of private savings among the middle classes in the last years are likely to lead to a larger number of legacies of the people who died in about per cent left a legacy and more than half of those left assets worth or more but as people are encouraged to save more for their own needs particularly for retirement housing and education more will die with capital to spare the household survey estimates that there will be million pensioner householders by yvonne bennion of the work foundation believes the inheritance issue could have a profound effect on the workplace and particularly on the relationship between workers and employers there is an effect on motivation she says getting an inheritance can reduce the desire of people to take risks and challenges she believes employers may need to work harder if they want to attract people who have the financial freedom to stay at home there are very interesting consequences for managers what do you have to do to be an employer of choice it may be that they need to take a wider view of flexibility so far employers have tended to introduce flexibility around parental needs but the issue of flexibility now needs to be looked at more broadly whether or not inheritors stay in work it seems that some employers are recognising the need to compete for staff by providing better terms and conditions offering flexibility seems to be commonplace among employers who want to attract older workers bampq the nationwide marks amp spencer and other employers who have a positive attitude to sixtysomethings often offer very flexible arrangements parttime working in particular and other schemes such as leave of up to three months a year and jobsharing it might be that more employers will offer people the opportunity to take a sabbatical says gillian edwards of the human resources consultancy at actuary mercers she also predicts that flexible employment packages will become more widespread allowing workers to design their own deals increasing their holiday entitlement for example and reducing medical insurance benefit mike emmott of the chartered institute of personnel and development believes that authoritarian command and control bosses are going out of fashion and being followed by more respectful and supportive managers jobs that people want to do involve more freedom draw on more parts of their personality and enable them to take more decisions employers might also start improving their pay and benefits levels by for instance introducing golden hellos or simply upping pay alastair hatchett of incomes data services believes some employers might even improve their pension schemes although he does not predict the widespread return of the final salary scheme he says it is more likely that poor money purchase schemes would be enhanced in particular he thinks employers who do not make a contribution into stakeholder pensions might be more likely to do so in future if they felt they needed to do more to attract and retain staff pensions may be an area where employers compete with each other one thing that the controversy over the disappearance of final salary schemes has done is to educate workers about the value of good pension plans the inheritance issue is likely to affect only older workers in large numbers but while people in their forties and fifties may now feel coldshouldered by employers this is expected to change a demographic shortage of twentysomethings over the next two decades at least will make older workers more attractive to employers it could be that the issue is already starting to make itself felt many people who have not actually had an inheritance have nevertheless come into a windfall through the explosion in house prices many of those who have traded down and therefore taken out the equity in their old house have had an extra or more to play with these people are contributing to the trends towards leaving large cities forsaking traditional employment downshifting taking up second careers and generally chasing quality of life would you carry on working if you hit the jackpot it is clear that the majority of people who come into very large sums of money are less inclined to work in a survey of winners of m or more in the national lottery camelot found that only per cent of them continued in work and of those per cent moved to a new job lottery winners also tend to be less physically active per cent gained weight as a result of a more sedentary lifestyle however those winning smaller amounts appear to be more likely to continue earning camelots alison boyle says people who win smaller prizes tend to pay off their mortgage go on holiday and throw a party even if they win they tend to feel that they need to keep on working brett afsher of mintel takes the same view

i worked with one once about years ago a father that is who eagerly looks at his watch each day waiting for hometime so that he can rush off to change his childrens nappies perhaps thats being a bit cruel but a new survey for management today magazine in association with the work foundation and bt found that of fathers would not consider trading career progression for time with their family nearly a third of those surveyed even thought that flexible working legislation coming in on april goes too far struth just chain them to the desk i say and throw away the key but the survey also reveals that there are a lot of guilty dads out there too nearly a quarter said they felt they had neglected their children recently by spending too much time at work and said they work for organisations without familyfriendly facilities or policies after considering these apparently contradictory findings the survey identified five different types of working fathers twentyfirst century dads are the rare fathers who put their childrens happiness above their career they consider themselves very different to their own fathers who traditionally left childcare up to mum twentyfirst century dad doesnt think that having family commitments disadvantages his career and would be happy for his wife to work while he stays at home with the kids stepdad is acutely aware of the need to balance life outside work with career commitments he is likely to have one or two relationships behind him and sees family as being as important as work happy dad loves being a dad having a child in his life has increased his enjoyment of work and life he is still ambitious but will not put ambition before his children in contrast juggler dad is unhappy with his lot he is committed to work but at the expense of time with his family his overriding emotion is one of guilt not being there for his family and children but unable to break the cycle carer dad is dealing with the demands of caring for children and elderly parents he is in the classic sandwichgeneration trap with demanding home and work responsibilities work can sometimes feel like a haven from home but this is tinged with a feeling that he is neglecting his family i think they forgot one though what about bad dad the one who gets his secretary to organise his childrens birthday presents you know who you are after dropping in

mothers will be getting cards chocolates and other mothers day presents this morning but the best gifts of all could be those coming from the government next sunday women with babies due on or after april will be entitled by law to a years maternity leave up from a maximum of weeks now the rate of payment of flatrate statutory maternity pay smp will rise from a week to we welcome the changes as a step in the right direction says helen terry of the maternity alliance professor jan pahl an expert on womens finances from the university of kent salutes the treasury which in her view has greatly helped mothers and children since labour came to power in it is amazing what the treasury has managed to do at least half a million children have been lifted out of poverty the rules are however rather more complicated than they might sound the law firm eversheds explains all pregnant employees regardless of length of service will be entitled to weeks ordinary maternity leave employees with weeks continuous employment by the fifteenth week before the expected week of confinement will be entitled to weeks smp and a further weeks additional maternity leave at present ordinary maternity leave lasts weeks and only employees with a years continuous service qualify for additional maternity leave women returning to work after ordinary maternity leave are entitled to the same job back and women returning after additional maternity leave can get the same kind of job according to aon consultings maternity leave specialists while on maternity leave a woman will be paid at per cent of average weekly earnings for the first six weeks and then per week for the next weeks after that she is unpaid the system of benefits or credits as the government prefers to call them also changes on april when the working tax credit replaces working families tax credit and the child tax credit replaces childrens tax credit many people may not realise that they qualify for these benefits although both are meanstested they reach much of middle england a family with one child earning could still get child tax credit of a week the government estimates that nine in families with children will qualify for some child tax credit the child tax credit is paid in addition to child benefit and working tax credit the highest rates go to those on the lowest incomes those with earnings below get per week for one child for two or for three or morethe payment is increased in the year following the birth of a child so it is important to tell the inland revenue when a baby is born there is concern that many people do not understand their entitlements this is a shame since the extra element for a new baby is likely to be in child tax credit is also paid to the main carer usually the mother the amount of working tax credit paid depends on the number of hours worked income level and number of children it is paid through the payroll to employees and direct by the inland revenue to the selfemployed there are numerous other benefits and entitlements that pregnant women and new parents should know about especially if they are low earners child benefit however is not meanstested all pregnant women and those who gave birth in the last months are also entitled to free prescriptions and free dental treatment other changes affecting families come into place on april paternity pay for up to two weeks becomes payable at the rate of a week from next sunday and one adoptive parent with weeks continuous service to the date of notification of being matched with a child for adoption will have the right to adoption leave paid at per week for a newly adopted child under for weeks they could extend their leave by another weeks but this would be unpaid while family campaigners welcome the

diet they become more not less adventurous as they get older said william nelson analyst manager for the future foundation thinktank after the age of where our older generations almost flatlined in terms of stopping making any really important decisions at all each successive generation has made increasingly radical changes to their lives said nelson if the trend continues someone born in can expect to have made more than lifechanging decisions in the course of their lifetimes according to the research based on the british household panels survey of adults across britain aged and over there are two main reasons for this social revolution according to nelson firstly there are simply more life events including more marriages divorces house moves job moves and periods of cohabitation but there are also demographic and financial drivers creating delays which mean people are leaving home later and continuing in education for longer many people however tend to avoid making any significant changes at all with almost per cent of those questioned never significantly changing their diet per cent never changing their dress style and per cent never altering their hairstyle in the past however the unwillingness to embrace change was even more pronounced with the average person never significantly changing any aspect of their life at all after the age of now just one in of those

the number of women who shatter glass ceilings and burst into previously male dominated occupations continues to rise but when it comes to equal pay for doing the same job it is a sad story the reality according to an equal opportunities commission eoc report out this week is that the gap between male and female earnings has hardly closed the equal pay act which removed discrimination between men and women in pay and other terms of their contracts of employment hit the statute books in yet the current eoc figures show that for every that a woman worker earns her male counterpart is paid the gap is even wider for women who have to work parttime to meet their childcare commitments they earn less per hour than men who work fulltime the same gap as years ago whats more the majority of employers polled by eoc said that they have no plans to check whether they pay their female staff fairly the eoc research by the institute for employment studies also reveals that secrecy about pay remains widespread more than a fifth of employers do not allow employees to share information about their pay with colleagues julie mellor chair of the eoc warned that complacency and secrecy were threatening to halt progress on equal pay and urged all employers to review their pay systems for any inbuilt pay bias some practices such as the payment of bonuses and performance related pay were much more common for some occupational groups than others for example a higher proportion of organisations paid performance related bonuses to managers typically male than to mainly female support staff the employing organisations who already carry out the type of thorough equal pay review envisaged by the eoc are thin on the ground the eoc research reveals that only of large employers and of mediumsized employers have actually implemented a pay review the majority of large and of mediumsized employers do not have any plans to conduct a pay review at all ms mellor says the level of complacency and secrecy this research has uncovered is staggering employers have a crucial role to play in tackling unequal pay although some have accepted that responsibility willingly many others still dont seem to have got the message one of the main reasons women are paid less than men is that their jobs are lower down the food chain more than of women workers are in just occupations where they are greatly overrepresented work as sales assistants as secretaries and as nurses none of them highly paid occupations by contrast more than of engineers and technicians much more highly paid professions are men patricia hewitt secretary of state for trade and industry and minister for women said the eoc research reveals a depressing snapshot that shows too many workplaces are still stacked against women fulfiling their true earning potential but it also makes me more determined to keep on working with the eoc employers and unions to close the pay gap the minister pointed to a statutory equal pay questionnaire one of the provisions of the employment bill that is intended to help employment tribunals speed up the resolution of equal pay disputes the questionnaire which comes into force from next month would allow an employee who believes they are not receiving equal pay to request information from their employer on any matter which is or may be relevant to their case this

the total cost of having a baby comes as an unexpected shock to almost half of firsttime parents according to a new survey released this week by american express on average it costs almost to cover all the expenses of a babys first year this figure includes prebirth purchases such as maternity wear cot pram and car seat plus daytoday items once the baby is born such as nappies clothing formula milk and food but doesnt include childcare costs and any loss of parental earnings even more will obviously be spent by parents who want designerclad offspring and the latest hitech baby equipment the feel we got by talking to parents and looking at costs was that the real average spend is between at the budget end and at the luxury end said an amex spokesperson some of parents with children under the age of five said their firstborn was more expensive than they had expected and only of respondents said they had budgeted sufficiently for their first child most of those surveyed said that they had had to make lifestyle sacrifices to accommodate unexpected additional baby costs the biggest change had been cutting down on entertainment such as eating out and going to the cinema perhaps an inevitable result of having a young baby as much as because of the costs involved closely followed by buying fewer clothes other lifestyle changes included saying goodbye to expensive foreign holidays or holidaying in the uk instead buying cheaper groceries postponing diy projects and reducing financial contributions to pensions investments and savings a small number of respondents even resorted to a downgrade in the family car to cover the additional costs amexs tip for helping to cope with the impact of baby costs is a rather surprising one put your familys household spending on to a credit card which provides cashback rather than a a debit card however this only makes sense if you have the discipline to pay off your bill in full each month and avoid any interest charges among cashback cards the american express blue card and the capital one circle card provide the best return each giving a cashback on everything you spend other practical ways of coping with baby costs include plan ahead and save as much as possible in advance during the pregnancy when both parents are still working keep the money in an accessible nonotice bank or building society account check out the best interest rates in jobs amp moneys best buy tables or on theguardiancommoney draw up a baby list and suggest practical items you really need when friends and family ask what gift they can buy for your

local branches of the charity national childbirth trust nct regularly run nearly new sales where you can buy baby and childrens clothes and equipment at much reduced prices straight from their owners the only items not sold are cot mattresses and car seats which should ideally be bought new for a baby nct sales also offer parents a chance to recoup some money spent previously on new items by selling them on the charity takes a commission on what you sell for details of your near est nct branch and nearly new sales across the uk for call the charity on or visit

disposable nappies supermarket own brand labels cost less and its cheaper to buy in bulk but you can really cut costs and prevent waste if you join the of parents who opt for reusable nappies according to the womens environmental network wwwwenorguk which says that savings from using home laundered nappies for a single child can amount to for advice contact the real nappy project at wen on nappieswenorguk the cost of formula milk makes breastfeeding a much cheaper option if it works for you and once you start weaning you can save by pureeing your own baby food rather than buying expensive packets and jars before buying nonessential items such as baby bouncers borrow one if possible to see if its worth the outlay take a tip from parents about the things you can do without travel consultant kerry cipriano says that despite planning ahead and saving up before the birth of her first child luca now aged two and a half she was still taken aback by the costs involved overall i think we spent more than in preparation for luca and during his first year she says some of that such as doing up and equipping the nursery wed saved up for while i was pregnant and still working full time but it was the ongoing costs afterwards that came as a surprise babies grow so fast that i seemed to be buying new clothes all the time i must have spent or so in the first year i was also unable to breastfeed for long so buying formula milk was a large expense other unexpected costs were the price of mother and baby group activities such as swimming and tumble tots which cost around looking back ms cipriano who lives in huby north yorkshire realises there are some things she could have done without i only used the baby bath about twice and never used the bottle warmer id bought the baby carrier was also a waste of money be cause luca hated it she says on the other hand other expensive luxuries like a battery operated baby swing costing were worth their weight in gold two minutes in that and he was asleep so it was a great investment practical presents from relatives saved ms cipriano some money but a dearth of nearly new shops or sales in her area meant she had to buy most things new weve coped with the costs by things like cutting down on holidays and going out a lot less than we used to she says i also try to budget carefully and make the most of cash back and

it is not easy being a man even the happiest of men in the happiest of relationships can feel under constant pressure to provide for the family if they are in the traditional breadwinning role rather like having a mortgage that they can never pay off or reduce and in the unhappiest circumstances of bloody divorce many men feel they lose everything the wife the children the home the savings the income the selfrespect and perhaps even the job much media attention has focused on the financial plight of women probably because they are seen as the underdogs who earn less money have smaller pensions and are often tied to the sink and babies rather than climbing up the greasy pole but there is a considerable amount of male angst about being the breadwinner as cash quickly found out when it spoke to experts and ordinary people about men and money younger men may feel they are under less strain but certainly men who think they have to bring home the bacon sometimes wonder if they are up to the task particularly if their job is under threat or earnings are low paternity pay first the good news for babies due to be born on or after april this year fathers with six months service will be able to claim up to two weeks paternity leave paid at the rate of per week or per cent of pay if you earn less than per week but many of you will not take it just as there has been little uptake of the unpaid weeks of parental leave per child that has been available since i would like to take it but it wouldnt be taken well at work if i did says one typical whitecollar male many

rules came into force this month for new cases and will be introduced for existing cases when the system beds down although the scheme has been welcomed by the solicitors family law association for

judges have made divorce law far more sympathetic to women in the last three years in three cases white v white cowan v cowan and lambert v lambert in the small number of divorces where there are assets to spare it looks as if the assets should be divided even in traditional marriages where the wife looked after the child while the husband set up a business mark harper of solicitor withers says case law has yet to address some important questions what happens if there are premarital assets what happens where one person inherited a lot of money before or during the marriage these judgments are putting men off marriage ive had a lot of clients who were thinking of getting married for the second time but changed their mind because of this says harper in the majority of cases where there are not enough assets to cover the needs of both spouses and the children the bulk of the assets usually go to the childrens carer normally the mother redundancy men are more likely to get

reducing taxes or safeguard ing your property by transferring your home or other assets into your wifes name ive seen so many cases where couples have split up says spencer it is a problem in this day

am james butters gives monthold thomas his milk then breakfast after getting thomas into his outdoor clothes they head for the park to chase pigeons and play on the swings with lunchtime approaching theyre back home for an afternoon of drawing playing with cars maybe catching an episode of tweenies james discovers that his mobile and keys have been posted through the catflap james isnt thomass dad he is a nanny a male nanny obviously cutely termed a manny btectrained and in his third nannying position at he commutes from hastings to care for thomas in beckenham kent plus another boy of a similar age its much freer than a structured office job he says and youre getting to see children develop and grow you bond with them definitely i dont think im special or better than a female nanny everyone has their own approach but im unusual friends laughed when i started studying nursery nursing on my course i was the only man among women somehow i coped although its still rare to find men on traditional nannying courses attitudes are changing in the united states parents are employing young mannies sometimes to care for babies but more often as active role models to coax junior away from the tv and the computer from rollerblading buddies to summer surf mannies these are the big brothers who are always willing to play to boot a football in the driving rain largely because theyre paid for it its a trend that is catching on here earlier this year norland welcomed its first fulltime british student yearold peter cummins from dyfed in wales who wears a specially designed uniform navy blazer grey trousers while some families baulk at the idea of a young man in a traditional nannying role male nannies and au pairs are increasingly popular naomi rawlings managing director of nanny agency to in diss norfolk has seven children ranging from eight to and enthuses i promote boys big time theres less doorslamming less discodiva behaviour men tend to be confident fit in easily as part of the family and the children have thought they were wonderful when they leave we keep in touch sebastian whos spanish has had one of my sons to stay with him in spain rawlings adds that a manny about the house can balance things out especially for single mothers its only dads who can be iffy about having another guy about the place they might be jealous of a man doing dadtype activities with their kids working mothers are no strangers to nanny envy according to tim kahn author of bringing up boys and a primary school teacher dads should recognise the qualities that a male carer can bring to the home men are more likely to feel comfortable with roughandtumble play which is great for girls and pretty essential for boys a mans boundaries around danger tend to be more relaxed hes more likely to let a child walk on that wall if a child plays in this way at three four years old that spirit of adventure and curiosity stays with him for life so are we heading for clusters of mannies watching their charges scale climbing frames robin dealby a registered childminder in bradford west yorkshire finds himself at toddler groups three times a week at first women looked at me as if i couldnt possibly cope but after five years im a regular fixture having taken redundancy dealby was attracted by an opportunity to be selfemployed and get involved in these kids lives ive had children from six months until theyre four years old and its hard to let go sometimes none have minded being looked after by a man if they fall over they have no problem running to me for james butters the only downside is securing a job when you call about a job and they hear a male voice they might say theyll get back to you and you hear nothing my references are perfect but some parents cannot get past the fact that youre a man however with a sevenmonthold child of his own butters has no intention of switching careers being a nanny has given me a head start as a dad ive spent

first there were the baby boomers then there was thatchers children after them came generations x and y and now now apparently we have the diy generation marketers love inventing new terms so they can pigeon hole people but while in the past they have tended to do so in cultural terms giving the groups sexy labels such as generation x they now appear keen on more utilitarian pursuits by using labels to define goups in financial terms cue the diy generation research by marks amp spencer financial services is the latest attempt to conjure up a new demographic group its research has identified the diy generation as todays to yearolds facing a future squeeze on their finances the research found that members of this generation more than its predecessors will have to fend for themselves financially and should expect to see less in the way of inherited wealth yet according to the research twothirds of the group were deluding themselves by relying on some form of inheritance to cushion them against future financial difficulties not that long ago banking on an inheritance to boost personal wealth was impossible for most people for a long time it was the preserve of only the very seriously rich but all that changed as personal wealth grew dramatically in the second half of the thcentury it was the resulting rapid growth in inherited wealth that led former prime minister john major to say in a famous speech that wealth was cascading down the generations however there is mounting evidence that the tide is beginning to turn and that the inheritance pot is on the verge of drying up in short the money which would once have been set aside to be passed on to the next generation is out of necessity being used to fund retirement as life expectancy continues to rise retirement income is increasingly stretched to the limit savings and home equity are dipped into more and more to help with the costs of a long retirement and sometimes with expensive long term care with life expectancy predicted to grow even further this leaves retirees with less money to pass on and diyers with further pressure to fend for themselves and perhaps even subsidise their parents if there is one thing we know for certain about the future it is that life expectancy is going up warns donna bradshaw of independent financial advisers fiona price and partners younger people need to realise that inheritance is not an entitlement people can expect to be retired for around years now and i would advise the retired to make the most of it rather than worry about leaving money to their children people really are going to have to take more responsibility for themselves and save more as people live longer and longterm care costs become an issue it just doesnt make sense to rely on an inheritance the diy generation could become stuck between a rock and a hard place the mamps research predicts not only are they in more debt than any previous generation but diyers will face the added problem that the times in life when people traditionally save more will no longer mean the same for them a combination of paying for student debts for longer taking on larger mortgages and having children later in life will mean there will be few financially commitmentfree stages in a diyers life the older generation may be struggling to fund their retirement but the outlook for the younger generation is even worse says alan rensch of mamps financial services the stages in our lives where we traditionally squirrel away savings are being squeezed people will need to dip into the assets such as property to make up for the shortfall of their own retirement savings rather than passing them on to the next generation he adds this will leave a new diy generation who must adopt the savings mentality as early as possible if they are to face the financial challenges ahead and not be disappointed in old age but there is another threat looming for baby boomers and diyers alike soaring house prices have pushed thousands more people into the inheritance tax bracket it is not uncommon for a property to now exceed the threshold at which inheritance tax kicks in some m homes are already there according the halifax so unless they can find a way to dodge the tax retired people hoping to leave a decent inheritance could see a large chunk of it disappear and it is anyones guess what will happen when the diyers finally get to retire baby boomers earning their name because of the sheer volume of children born after the second world war baby boomers became synonymous with hippiedom flower power and the first summer of love they were also the first generation to benefit from a breakdown of class barriers spurred by wider higher education opportunities and the opening of new universities job prospects and earning power rose substantially they chose to have fewer children than their parents and enjoy their cash financially they have been the lucky ones most have benefited from the long postwar stock market boom earning them generous finalsalary pensions although they endured the inflation and high interest rates of the s and s they have been rewarded with properties that are worth vastly more than the mortgages attached to them thatchers children the greed is good generation was personified by the harry enfield character loadsamoney waving his wad of banknotes the financial centre of thatchers children was the city of london enjoying a spurt of growth brought on by big bang and the influx of foreign banks the species were perhaps most at home in wine bars loudly clinking champagne glasses as the stock market soared meanwhile agency types in the west end consulted bulging filofaxes before doing a deal over a clunking big mobile phone but the generation that was in their s and s during the s have suffered a chequered time since the party ended with the stock market crash followed by the property market crash of the early s and today their pensions have crashed with the long bear market in equities generation x as the early s dawned sociologists spotted a new phenomenon labelled generation x these were individuals more interested in music than money keener to pursue jobs that made them happy and fulfilled rather than rich style conscious in the extreme like their baby boomer forebears they attempted to reject conventions and norms they have been immortalised in the iconic image of nirvana frontman kurt cobain and gained a reputation for being a generation of slackers and dropouts financially they suffered mixed fortunes more have gained access to higher education than any previous generation but they are also the first to pay for it building up hefty student debts now many are tied down to big mortgages and they are paying the price of the late s property boom the diy generation todays generation of school leavers and graduates have earned a new moniker the diy generation the new century has apparently brought with it a generation with nothing to look forward to except financial trauma experts say this group can expect a cashstrapped youth middle age and retirement they will in effect have to do it all themselves with little financial help from the state or from their parents in the form of inheritance more than any other generation before this one will be largely university educated but they are destined to spend their s paying off student debts their early s saving for a mortgage deposit and wondering how they can afford to have children their s and s will be spent paying for their children

there have been quite significant developments and improvements this year last year we received home office funding of for a project to provide communitybased advocacy support including bengalispeaking advocates trained to help women deal with the complex issues and bureaucracy involved in escaping from domestic violence that funding is now being taken over by tower hamlets the fact that it is coming into the mainstream is a real step forward we are also training women as trainers to work with gps midwives and womens aid groups on domestic violence issues the most heartening thing is that there is an increased awareness of the problem of domestic violence the government is prepared to talk about the issue and put resources into it the resources are still limited though if you break down the m they are putting into local crime and disorder partnerships over three years it comes out at a year for us compared with the money for fighting drugs that is minimal but at least its a move in the right direction the mayor of londons strategy which has set minumum standards for all agencies is also a very positive development locally we are seeing a really clear and renewed commitment from the police they are making exactly the right noises mind you local government is still awash with consultants it is all very target driven most of the targets are quite good but the pace at which they are expected to be achieved is excessive the emphasis on positive spin also worries me it still seems as though the spin and the reality are some way apart morale is very mixed we had so many people leaving last summer that there were double bookings on leaving parties in august even i reached a point where i had had enough but things have become more positive in the governments comprehensive performance assessment tower hamlets came out in the second group which is good a bit of positive validation does no harm at all overall i feel we are beginning to win the arguments and be taken seriously public voices march domestic violence organiser tower hamlets london salary last year my time was divided between working on equal opportunitites and countering domestic violence now i focus entirely on domestic violence more of my work is involved in developing policies and strategies i have a staff of two the profile of domestic violence has risen and thats good tower hamlets has reported cases a year of them ethnic minority women and reporting is increasing the council has recognised the issue as a central part of community safety one of its key objectives ken livingstone has announced a domestic violence strategy for london and the gla is identifying minimum standards and relevant agencies i am very frustrated at the lack of resources it is still very difficult to get longterm funding and shortterm funding is simply not an adequate way to meet a continuing and growing need it feels as though we are on a constant hunt for funding ill give you an example last year we developed a womens advocacy service with four speciallytrained staff to support complainants it had no publicity but women used it the need is out there but the service was likely to be closed because it was built on shortterm funding it has now been saved if we saw the same level of resources being expended on tackling domestic violence as we see on tackling drugs we could really make some impact mind you it doesnt feel like the resources are really limited because they are able to pay quite a lot to heaps of consultants coming in sometimes it feels like we are being overrun by consultants since last year morale has got worse there is a now enormous pressure to perform this is partly the impact of central governments expectations of quick change which gets internalised there is a lot of anxiety about the changing management culture about a consultants culture i do not see get a sense of people under attack but tony blair and co banging on about the public services puts a huge burden on everyone politicians make promises that have to be fulfilled by the next election but it takes time to sort things out in the world of political spin once something has been announced it has been done it isnt like that in the real world the delivery of services is dependent on the skills of people delivering them and it takes time and resources to train those people i have no doubt that the situation can be improved otherwise i would not still be here getting worse might be part of getting better and i am willing to give it a chance the common good march equalities officer tower hamlets london salary about four fifths of my time is spent on domestic violence issues tower hamlets has reported cases a year from ethnic minority women everywhere the system fails them the better information they have the better theyre able to deal with their situations we are working to make services better to help women get protection and support and ultimately take the onus off them from having to deal with violence and abuse alone i have a staff of three we coordinate an strong forum police officers social workers lawyers healthcare professionals and community workers which develops the boroughs strategy to reduce domestic violence we provide material for voluntary groups and organise training and presentations were developing a team of four speciallytrained community advocates to support women and were logging complaints in a more coordinated fashion were always trying to broaden the issues now were putting more emphasis on rape and sexual assault forced marriage is also beginning to come on to the agenda last year i wrote a page domestic violence handbook for the borough on equality we give advice to the councils equal opportunities steering group we put out information to other groups and develop local projects to tackle inequality but we are mainly a policybased team we dont deal with many individual cases both my areas of work are immensely valuable though like anything that challenges existing practice and power relationships it can be frustrating many people in local government are still motivated but there is always some resistance generally morale is quite low people just dont feel valued there is a history of starving local government of resources and there is no kudos from being a local government officer i do have a real sense of vocation about it though two women die every week as a result of domestic violence in britain if i can contribute to reducing that figure then my job is worthwhile i could probably get a year as a project manager in the private sector but it wouldnt be the same im very lucky to be able to do this work and get paid for it,2003-03,quite significant development

some promising developments are in the wind in the long struggle for parents to win tax exemption for child care last month paymaster general dawn primarolo launched a government consultation paper on the issue consultation closes on may too late to have any influence on this years budget but an indication that next years budget may bring good news what was significant was that the paper was launched at the royal london hospital the nhs has been busy encouraging the establishment of workplace creches in nhs trusts and unlike some government schemes this is well on the way to delivery its purpose is to encourage health professionals who have left their jobs to have children to return in establishing better childcare provision however the nhs came up against the nub of the problem healthcare requires shift work and the availability of ninetofive childcare is of limited use to a nurse who starts work at am so in tandem with creche facilities nhs trusts are also being encouraged to set up childcare coordinators to give advice on longterm and emergency childcare provision there is a financial issue here too while workplace creches are not a taxable benefit so called childcare vouchers the provision an employer might make towards a child minder or on a slightly grander scale a nanny are not the government line on this continues to soften the blair administration has been very parentfriendly not least in introducing tax exemption for workplace creches now it is minded to allow employers to make other forms of childcare such as company approved childminders available tax free this is more likely to be of interest to public sector employers rather than the private sector the metropolitan police is one employer wrestling with the problem of providing childcare for shiftworkers the government cannot quite bring itself to allow full tax exemption for parents who would prefer to approve their own childminders but the idea is under consideration and the tide seems

if a room full of children appeals as a workplace nursery work is for you like teachers nursery workers try to help children realise their potential they deal with the first faltering steps a child takes in writing and reading nursery workers love their jobs they have to the work is so badly paid and the hours so long that if they did not like working with children and have immense patience it would be an impossible career path as per cent of childcare workers are female it can be difficult and intimidating to be a man in this environment employers and the government are encouraging men to consider childcare as a career as there is no family norm these days and some children may lack a male role model although there are qualifications in nursery nursing it is possible to go straight in to the industry and get onthe job training making it perfect as a career change income the pay is poor the average hourly rate is just above the national minimum this increases to about for people in more senior positions an average annual salary is about rising by a couple of thousand pounds with experience and responsibility perks for people who love children working in nurseries is a vocation not a job watching a child in their early stages develop partially under your guidance is a reward in itself there is no dress code as running around children and being involved in their activities all day can be messy the hours are flexible this means work can be parttime fitted in around school holidays or termtime because of this childcare can be perfect for people who want to go back to work after having children scope for travel for both experienced and inexperienced nursery workers is wide a move from nanny to nursery assistant or back is a small one and as the former there are plenty of opportunities for travel also a career in childcare is not limited to nurseries alone once experience is gained in the area a change of career into helping children in hospitals or other places is possible also there are openings to go into management of nurseries and even the chance to establish one alone disadvantages the pay is limited and although promotion yields an increase in salary this too is small because the pay is minimal nursery workers must work long days to earn a decent wage this means the average is hours a week mostly on weekdays so eight hours a day or hours for four days working these long hours is fine if the job is not too taxing but looking after children who are discovering the world can be tiring you need a stock of ideas for activities patience enthusiasm commitment and a love of working with children but this is rarely the case all the time it is a real responsibility and nursery workers must be genuinely concerned about the welfare of children in their care the future nursing is very much femaledominated but there has been a recent push to recruit men nurseries are becoming a more integral part of everyday life as parents are returning to work sooner to develop their careers this was highlighted last week in a survey by the transport amp general workers union which found mothers in the north of england spending almost half their wages on

parents of children under six or of disabled youngsters under will have the right to apply to work flexibly from next month this means they will be able to request a change in the hours or the times they work or to be able to do so from home at the same time the government will increase and extend maternity leave and pay and introduce new rights to paid adoption and pater nity leave all these changes which come into force on april will be the sternest test yet of employers commitment to helping staff achieve a satisfactory worklife balance they will also raise fundamental questions about the relationship between companies and their employees and about the future of work itself it is a wakeup call to employers there is a definite trend towards people wanting to have a life and be more than a wage slave says bill quirke head of synopsis a consultancy specialising in business communication the legislation is speeding up something that has been happening for the past five years the question is how do you encourage flexibility without making it a problem to the business the new legislation will enable parents to ask to work flexibly though there is no automatic right and employers have the discretion to turn down their requests in order to make a request you must have a child under six or a disabled child under have worked continuously with your employer for weeks by the date the application make the application no later than two weeks before the childs sixth birthday have responsibility for the childs upbringing not be an agency worker or a member of the armed forces you must make the application in writing and only one request a year is allowed if your employer agrees to allow you to work flexibly you must accept a permanent change to your terms and conditions this is vital because it may mean taking a pay cut or adversely affecting your employers business so you need to think carefully about the implications your employer must arrange to meet you with days of your formal written request to discuss your plans two weeks later you must be told the result of your request and either when your new working pattern will start or why your application has been turned down the new rules should make it much easier for parents who are trying to juggle work and childcare says peter thompson of henley management college there is evidence that a high percentage of people who ring in sick do so because their children are ill but they feel uncomfortable about telling their employer thompson says the new legislation will give parents the option to change their working hours to fit around school hours for example coming in at am and leaving at pm and doing the rest of their work in the evening when the children are in bed one aspect parents need to be aware of is that it is no good trying to work from home while looking after children you need to put in place the same childcare as though you were going out to work he says some big employers such as lloyds tsb nationwide prudential and ibm have anticipated these changes and already put in policies to help their staff work more flexibly quirke of synopsis believes employers should be looking to use flexibility working as a way of recruiting and retaining staff rather than as an administrative headache when you are short of people who possess the right skills this is a way of encouraging people to join the workforce he says quirke has tips for wouldbe flexible workers who are thinking of approaching their employer think about why flexi working is important to you identify what is valuable about what you do and the way you do it communicate this to your boss in a formal request think about how it will affect your colleagues and boss and take this into account when you putyour proposal together while flexible working is fine in theory parents may find that in practice the rhetoric falls short it is one thing for an organisation to have a flexible working policy and quite another for that culture to have filtered down to line managers says professor malcolm higgs at henley management college the company can talk about its flexible working policy yet line managers who dont like things to change can exert subtle pressure the smart employer should see the new legislation as an opportunity not a problem says dr maria yapp business psychologist with xancam consulting the more enlightened employers are not thinking what can i squeeze out of this person but see their staff as an investment the more control you give people over their own lives and destiny the less stress they suffer,2003-03,parent child six disabled youngster right apply work flexibly next month mean able request change hour time work able home time government increase extend

leaders today stepped up their campaign to close the pay gap between men and women after a new report showed that almost twothirds of adult women compared with of adult men are on a below average income story in full what it means for you when asked to comment on the depressing statistics released by the trades union congress tuc this week tuc general secretaryelect brendan barber said the most effective way to lift women out of a life of poverty would be to eradicate the gender pay gap to allow women to earn a decent wage for the work they do thirty years after the equal pay act the gender pay gap remains a reality in the uk by the age of male graduates are already earning an average more than their female contemporaries on a likeforlike basis and across the age groups that gap rises to so why is the pay gap still with us and what is the government planning to do about it julie mellor chairperson of the equal opportunities commission lays some of the blame at the door of the british culture of secrecy about pay she believes that transparency about pay and bonuses is essential in every part of the labour market without that transparency there is a danger that factors other than performance could influence the rewards people receive she has high hopes of the new equal pay questionnaire for employees who suspect they are being paid unfairly which is due to be published on april alongside this a change in the law in april means that employees can discover what colleagues doing the same job are paid without having to go to a tribunal a first move in the breakdown in the culture of secrecy that mellor decries its a step in the right direction but women clearly have a long way to go before the gender pay gap is finally eradicated on guardian unlimited money special report women and money march buytolet market surged in buytolet mortgage lending rose by during the second half of as ongoing stock market volatility led to more people investing in property figures showed today story in full what it means for you the ftse is sinking like a stone interest rates are languishing and investing in pension schemes looks about as safe as standing in a pool under a tree in a thunderstorm not surprising then that with the property market soaring people have decided to put their money in bricks and mortar rather than risk it in equities and despite recent speculation that the housing boom may be over figures published by the council of mortgages lenders on tuesday showed that the buytolet market grew by almost a quarter during the second half of last year the question is therefore to buy or not to buy is the buytolet market as good an investment proposition as these figures appear to indicate look at the market in its historical context and the answer may in fact be perhaps not over the past halfdecade buytolet investors have been piling into the housing market at record rates the market grew by between and alone to take advantage of low interest rates and soaring property prices unfortunately as a result of this there are certain areas most notably in london and the southeast where market expansion was biggest where there are now more landlords than tenants the knockon effect of course is that rental income falls or even worse landlords are forced to go long periods without income although buytolet lending rose by in the second half of the number of tenancies arranged fell by during that period while the number of properties standing empty increased and it doesnt take a genius to work out that buytolet property without tenants is like a building society account without an interest rate there seems little doubt that the housing market in general will fall during the next few years although it may look positive now the buytolet sector

ted heath was in downing street slade were in the charts and there was a whole decade of political turbulence and dodgy fashion just around the corner it was more than years ago way back in that the equal pay act gave women the legal right to be paid the same as men sounds like a different world doesnt it and in many ways it is for over years the gap between mens and womens pay has been slowly but steadily shrinking yet a recent report from the equal opportunities commission eoc shows that unfair pay is not as outdated as we might have hoped last year almost years after merry xmas everybody was played for the very first time the gap widened again even without the recent bad news quarter of a century after the equal pay act women still havent caught up in the pay stakes the average hourly wage for a working man remains higher than it is for a woman or to put it another way a woman working full time earns just of her male colleagues salary for parttime workers of all working women are in parttime jobs that figure sinks to the pay gap will cost a woman with average qualifications during her lifetime for a lowskilled woman with two children the figure is closer to half a million the government had hoped that a mixture of initiatives in particular the introduction of the minimum wage would have a positive impact on wage differences why is it then that the situation has actually worsened for the first time in so many years according to a report by income data services the change is due to the high pay rises given last year to senior workers the vast majority of whom are male substantial jumps in pay for the top of male employees has pulled the overall male average upwards thus creating the growing difference it is hard to bear but its not quite a tragedy and in fact the statistic conceals some rather better news across the remaining of the workforce womens average hourly earnings actually grew at a faster rate than mens if it werent for the rises given to the most highlypaid men the gap should actually have continued its gradual shrinking but dont break out the babycham just yet with women making up exactly half the workforce why is it that the proportion of female top workers is small enough for changes in that sector to have such an impact and why is it that with space hoppers and the threeday week consigned to the dustbin of history an anachronism like the gender pay gap is still with us the governments equal pay taskforce outlined three main reasons behind the wage imbalance the first is what they call occupational segregation women in laymans terms tend to have lower paid jobs even in male secretaries and female it consultants are the exception figures released this february show that women still make up of employees in personal services and just of managers senior officials and professionals the second is the unequal impact of family responsibilities it is still more likely to be mum not dad who shoulders most of the childcare a trend that will be hard to reverse as long as dads job is the more lucrative stepping out of the labour market even briefly means that many women come back to work with reduced earning power and severely compromised prospects lastly there is straightforward pay discrimination though given what julie mellor chair of the eoc calls the british culture of secrecy about pay it is anything but straightforward mellor believes that transparency about pay and bonuses is essential in every part of the labour market without that transparency there is a danger that factors other than performance could influence the rewards people receive she has high hopes of the new equal pay questionnaire for employees who suspect they are being paid unfairly which is due to be published on april produced by the eoc the questionnaire should help resolve pay disputes and make the costly complex and confrontational tribunal process considerably swifter and hopefully unnecessary the confederation of british industry cbi on the other hand feels such moves need to be handled carefully the cbi considers unequal pay to be a serious issue but it feels that unfair discrimination makes up only a small part of the pay gap it welcomes the practical equal pay review tool recently launched on the eocs website but sees any legislation as unnecessarily intrusive and cumbersome susan anderson director of human resources policy at the cbi says we need to give more choices to women who are trying to balance work with family responsibilities that is far more sensible than imposing ineffective legislation on all employers to curb the discriminatory practices of a few unfortunately however it may not be just a few who are discriminating in the governments equal pay taskforce found that direct discrimination accounts for approximately half the difference in mens and womens pay denise kingsmill who headed the taskforce recommended a legislative approach to the problem and was promptly asked to perform another review with a specific remit to examine and report on possible nonlegislative proposals she now feels that voluntary audits will work but has stressed that the progress of the private sector in carrying out such audits really ought to be monitored with a view to considering the need for legislation on laggards at a future date such equivocal phrasing does not seem to herald radical change particularly since as a recent article in the guardian pointed out of businesses are perfectly satisfied with their pay systems as well they might be an eoc report published in january this year showed that only of nonexecutive directors in uk listed companies are women perhaps it is not surprising that the establishment should be satisfied with a system that protects its own so effectively figures like these make very miserable reading the fight however is far from over this year the government is bringing in new legislation to tackle gender discrimination lord lesters equality bill of recommendations was recently passed by the house of lords more immediately flexible working regulations will come into force from april meaning employers will have a legal duty to consider requests for flexible working from employees who are parents of young children paternity and maternity leave arrangements will also be improved encouraging mum and dad and their employers to look at family responsibilities as having a more general claim of course closing the gender pay gap requires a major shift in attitudes that will only develop over time however while its inevitable that christmas will see slades vintage classic making yet another comeback at office parties everywhere perhaps one thing we can avoid next year is a repeat of s retro statistics that really would

when redundancy strikes the nanny is the first casualty take sally thirtysomething and a successful conference organiser with two children aged four and six laura sallys nanny looked after the children three days a week while sally worked at her central london office then bam sallys company folded and within hours laura was given her notice i felt bad about it but the simple fact is that i wasnt earning any more so i couldnt afford to shell out the a month that laura was costing me says sally i decided to take a couple of months off and then look around for freelance work these days ive got some projects but im earning nothing like my previous salary so a nanny is a luxury i cant afford we have a slovakian au pair i pay her a week and she looks after the children after school and for a couple of evenings while we go out shes a lot cheaper than laura and i dont have to pay tax or ni contributions on her earnings in south london where sally lives playgrounds buzz with eastern european accents as au pairs take over where nannies once reigned economic uncertainty is forcing families to cut back on childcare and the easiest thing to do is to swap the qualified nanny for an unqualified but enthusiastic au pair who will help out around the home for a fraction of a nannys salary no surprise then that for nannies times are lean the pay of the average london livein fell by

than moving on but she also believes that the flood of girls from eastern europe has changed the job situation for homegrown nannies girls are coming in on au pair visas but theyre keen to earn as much money as possible so theyre a lot more willing to do domestic duties if it means extra cash she says the influx of eastern european au pairs is also having a knockon effect on childcare agencies alastair mcatee who runs the cheshire agency says hes decided not to place nannies any more there just isnt the demand its all happening in the au pair market he says mcatee has set up an au pair website wwwfindanaupaircom and business is booming theres a huge demand for au pairs because a lot of parents out there need help often its a mum and dad who are desperate to get out to work but a nanny is way out of their price range but finding an au pair doesnt necessarily mean keeping her for any length of time au pairs are like cats if theyre happy they will stay but if not they will soon find another home and i have a lot of trouble getting through to people that you have to treat an au pair as one of the family theyre not just a hired help says mcatee childcare campaigners also point out that au pairs arent quality child carers certainly theyre not recommended for babies and very young children or to be in sole charge for long periods of time but that attitude in itself represents what others see as a failure to grasp the complexity of the childcare issue shimeld says the government in particular is completely unrealistic about real needs childcare policy tends to concentrate on nurseries nannies and eighttosix care for preschoolers real families change and they change very quickly soon youve got children at school and others at nursery and afterschool clubs to get to and its all very complicated she says nurseries do clearly have their place and in the current uncertain economic climate they can sometimes represent particularly for a onechild family a more affordable option than a nanny jo philips a designer in north london says ive been trying to find a nursery place for my oneyearold and so far three ive contacted have told me that i can go on the waiting list but they wouldnt hold out a lot of hope when the forms arrived i was surprised to see that they didnt ask for the babys age they asked for the estimated date of delivery clearly you have to plan ahead better than ive done childminders are another cheaper option but they again are in short supply mandi whitington a childminder in canterbury says she had to turn away six children in just two weeks over christmas they all phoned within about days of each other and i just didnt have the vacancies its very difficult for parents they get the list of childminders in the area and then they start phoning round and its just one no after another a lot of the people who phone are mothers going back to work after maternity leave they tend to be demoralised by the lack of vacancies for babies and they often say that if they cant find childcare theyll have to give up work many parents feel childminders who are usually mothers themselves and who offer homebased care are the best option for babies and very young children but current regulations prevent registered childminders from having more than one baby under one unless theyre twins this says whitington is unnecessary sometimes youre having to turn away a sixmonthold because youve already got a monthold it doesnt make sense because their needs are different and the older baby will soon have his or her first birthday anyway according to oliver black director of tinies childcare which accounts for about per cent of the uk childcare market the bottom line is that the industry is still far too fragmented and issues like tax are still to be tackled people have to pay for childcare out of net income which means childcarers have to keep charges low if the tax incentives were deep enough and broad enough it would mean salaries could go up it would mean nurseries could recruit staff more easily and pay them better few nursery chains are making money at the moment although we all know the government included that this is a huge growth area and that parents are crying out for better provision and more choice in the sort of childcare they use he says reaping the benefits from april the new child tax credit and working tax credit will help supplement the incomes of parents families with incomes of up to will be eligible for the child tax credit which replaces the childrens tax credit this will be worth up to a year to families on low incomes with several children but the majority will receive a year those with at least one child under one year old will get a bigger payment the credit will be paid directly to the main carer and can be spent in any way that the carer chooses the working tax credit which replaces the working families tax credit is designed to top up wages for those on low incomes and will include an element to cover part of a familys childcare costs it will pay up to per cent of eligible childcare costs up to a maximum of a week for one child equal to a credit of a week and a week for two or more children equal to a credit of up to a week complete an application by calling or visiting wwwmoneymummycouk single parents can get help with childcare costs if they join the new deal for

organisations with lots of women employees such as banks tend to offer the most smaller employers though can sometimes help by being flexible about working hours dos and donts do think about asking your nanny to set up a personal service company so she can reduce her and so your tax and ni bills a nanny with her own company can set the salary she pays herself through her company to be lower than the amount she charges for her work do stick with a nanny if you have two or more children including one or more underfives nannies can be good value for several kids do think about a nursery if your child is twoplus and needs more input many nurseries double as nurseries for twoandahalf year olds and up do investigate taking on an au pair if you have room in your home and are around a lot of the time eg working from home do think about reciprocal agreements with other parents if youre working parttime maybe you could look after a friends child while she goes to work and viceversa dont put your baby into a nursery if you think youll soon be having another two children in a nursery isnt usually costeffective dont take on an au pair if what you really need is eighttosix sole charge

cent of those in the childcare industry nursery nurses childminders outofschool club workers and nannies are men with up to new childcare workers needed in the next three years ministers argue that the industry cannot afford to exclude men childcare is a demanding and rewarding career with real opportunities and we need to draw on a wider pool of talent said baroness ashton the minister for early years education the campaign will target men and other underrepresented groups including ethnic minorities and women aged to the daycare trust a childcare charity will launch a campaign in june under the sasstyle slogan he who cares wins arguing that men can be just as good at the job as women rosemary murphy of the national day nurseries association said the campaign should target boys

but the husbands can get very territorial they dont want another bloke in the house said maggie dyer who has men out of au pairs on the books of her london au pair and nanny agency if someone nasty rings the doorbell or there is a crisis with the plumbing a male au pair is more likely to be able to cope whenever a family has a successful male au pair when he leaves they wont hear of having a girl dyer has a male nanny from new zealand on her books who is instantly snapped up whenever he becomes available but says few men apply its really sad when male teachers in primary schools are now common chris meeks agrees a sheetmetal worker who was made redundant nine years ago he is now a childminder working with his wife a childminder for nearly two decades at their home in hertfordshire i never think about going back now said meeks a member of the national childminders association before i was making pieces for airplanes and you never saw where they went now i can see how the children come on at the end of the day you feel worth while a father of seven grownup children he is trained in first aid and child development and a dab hand at nappy changing he hates being the only man on training courses but there are now enough fathers at the school gates for him to blend in he feels that more men would be attracted if childcare was recognised as a career younger fathers will stay at

the baby boomer generation is still breaking demographic records a large proportion of them are seeing their teenage children off to college and then splitting up a recent report from the economic and social research council shows that the number of separating couples in their late s and early s has doubled in the past years making them the largest single divorcing group a full of children over experienced their parents divorce in so what is it about this stage of life that prompts a parting of ways clearly those who believed that an early split would be damaging and unfair to the family suddenly have a choice the point at which children leave home creates a natural break you are face to face alone over the kitchen table explains gina who left home shortly after her youngest daughter went to university suddenly there is no buffer between you and him there is no mother role to hide behind and you think this is it for the rest of my life he wants something from me and i dont think i can give it such an urge to leave can come as a complete shock to a partner and even to the person who is leaving i am amazed at the speed of these breakdowns one relate counsellor told me it is as if the marriage has been masked in some way by the busy allconsuming role of mother and father working parents household organisers with no time to think once the last child is gone the routine and the role goes too and the couple are left to review what is left but there can be no mistaking the enormity of such a move sally fisher learned of her husbands intention to leave just days after her son went away to college of course i knew things would be different we never discussed it but i had assumed we would have the time and energy for all the things we had enjoyed in our year marriage but he clearly had other plans the shock was devastating a physical pain like being aerated by one of those garden spike machines i fight the desperate sense of so what was all that about then by reminding myself we have a wonderful son out of it but the sense of betrayal and worthlessness has made me wonder if i put too much into marriage and mothering if it ends in ashes like this penny mansfield from one plus one the social research organisation that monitors couple relationships agrees that when the last child leaves home it can be a challenging time for many couples many people do say i want something for myself now not as a parent or a provider but for me it saddens me that partners often completely fail to recognise the urgency of demands like this over and over again i see people refusing to change and resisting when partners say they have had enough now and so often when their spouse has gone off and found someone who will begin on a new life adventure they say if only i had known i would have given it a go opportunities for the people whom mansfield describes as young middleaged are tremendous parents have never been hipper as the last child leaves home they are often feeling fit youthful and ready for the adventures of the next years sociologist anthony giddens has written widely on second chances in life and sees divorce in this light divorce is an option it is no longer a disgrace i can remember one aunt when i was a child who was divorced and singled out to sit alone in a corner with a small sherry today we accept that divorce can be a mechanism for a fresh beginning something new and exciting and the disapproval from young people is so much less and when kids leave home they do negotiate a new relationship with their parents anyway they often say they get to know their parents for the first time certainly the censure was gone for me reflects robert a yearold who left home only two months after his youngest child went to university i had been silently fearful of any terrible scenes suddenly there was the prospect of doing my own thing without the reproachful glances over the breakfast table the prospect of freedom was heady stuff and i went for it probably in a very selfish way but i had to do it gina too remembers her first flush of life on her own as a real exhilaration its ironic but the unpredictability after a life of such order and organisation was just fabulous mansfield points out that older divorced people now feel they can swim in the exciting waters of singledom alongside younger people our society especially in the urban setting is much more fluid and open to single life than it was we are less willing to condemn those who divorce not to be married in your s is not the unusual phenomenon it once was laura telfer a relate counsellor for years agrees that the split when the children have gone can be very appealing there is definitely a susceptible time when the children leave home when all possibilities seem open but it does not make the unexpected desertion any easier what can be an exciting venture for one partner is invariably a painful grieving episode for other family members children watch appalled as their family that secure and safe place that survived all their childhoods is swiftly dismantled bronwen hipkin whose marriage ended after years resents the label of failure how can a relationship that has nurtured children almost into adulthood be viewed as anything but a success i honestly believe that marriages have their allotted life span and some come to the end of their natural life i really dont think that separating couples who have done a good job bringing up their kids should beat themselves up over this but robert who left home so abruptly acknowledges the devastation his departure caused i have not escaped the fury of the children they could not forgive me for what i did and frankly i have seen them very little since then they are so enraged our meetings turn into bitterly reproachful tirades at the moment our only relationship seems to consist of the handover of the cheque gina who feels that she powered her exit from marriage with a potent mixture of raging emotion and rebellion from the domestic role also has regrets the rush of excitement fades and then it is too late to go back words cannot express the physical feelings of loss and grief you experience and it goes on as the children get older the graduation ceremonies and weddings are all flashpoints for conflict and difficulty you cannot help thinking how it might have been the joy you would have felt at witnessing these events together it suddenly feels completely wrong to be there alone or with someone who is nothing to do with your child i felt i left for adventure and freedom and doing things my own way but i also took on a lifetime of being brave for the childrens sake trying to be calm and skilful about the break being diplomatic about his new wife it is a constant struggle and when i know how easy it could have been and how there will never be that person to grow old with who was with me in the first part of my life i feel tragic,2003-03,baby boomer

women graduates are more likely than nongraduates to remain childless throughout their lives the office for national statistics said yesterday in a report which may explain the decline in britains birth rate the governments statisticians found that nine in every women with a university degree or other higher education qualification had no children by the end of their childbearing years compared with six in every nongraduates graduate mothers who delayed having children until after tended to have them in quick succession and their experience of higher education made little difference to the size of their families at any given age of childbearing mothers with a higher qualification were more likely than those without to have another child and were more likely to do so quickly but of those with a university degree or teaching or nursing qualification remained childless compared with of those without the result came from research into the experience of women born in england and wales between and who are coming to the end of their childbearing years about one in six of that age group achieved a higher qualification compared with one in three in the current generation of school leavers steve smallwood one of the authors of the report said it could not be proved that the expansion of higher education had caused the decline in national fertility rates over this period but it was possible that there was a link if it were so the governments plan to increase the proportion of the population with experience of higher education to could further depress the birth rate and contribute to the expected decline in the uk population after he said the relationship between education and fertility is complex a higher education may delay childbearing and increase the opportunity cost of having children but it also increases income the women graduates may have more to spend on children and that could result in having more of them the ons also published its uk population projections based on data from the census it expects the population to grow from m to m by nearly less than previously estimated its longer term projections suggest that the population will peak at nearly m in and then gradually decline to below m in the population of pensioners will exceed the number of children for the first time in by there will be about pensioners and children for every people of working age the figures for marriages in england and wales show there were in fewer than in and down on the number of religious ceremonies dropped by between and and the number of civil weddings fell by in the same period the average marrying age for single men rose from years in to in and for single women it increased from to the ons found that teenage girls were twice as likely to give birth if they were themselves the daughters of teenage mothers nearly twothirds of the uks population increase over the next years up by m to m will be caused by immigration according to the

as a result of happy circumstance my friend rebecca is in the enviable position of being the breadwinner in her household while her man looks after the children so how is it she asks me that at oclock on a weekday morning i find myself looking after the children while my husband goes for a run rebecca and i talk frequently on the phone as i am in a similar situation my husband left his job just as i got a new contract to work from home i had no idea how it was going to work but he was enthusiastic he had put our first baby to bed every night for the first two years while i worked late so its not as if he was new to childcare we decided to give it a try in the early days of the arrangement my working day was limited to the new babys nap times sure my husband was running the household and doing childcare he was taking our twoyearold to the zoo to the beach to the aquarium they went shopping together and had a great time it was marvellous except that he was looking after one child and we have two to manage two children at the same time he assured me was beyond the capabilities of normal people our children both under three are probably at the most demanding age between working at a computer and caring for toddlers there is absolutely no question as to which is the more arduous much of the time my husband feels im shirking when i sneak off to my study to squeeze in an hours work and because i know how hard his job is i am easily dissuaded from going up to my study i cant just sit at my desk if i hear howling from downstairs either their howls or his a sensible person would have rented an office so she wouldnt be in the house but it seemed an unnecessary expense and quite frankly i dont think the arrangement would have lasted five minutes forced to care for both children for an eighthour day my husband would have rebelled i often find myself thinking if you were a woman you would just get on with it grumbles rebecca how many women doing gruelling days with two or three children would love to say i cant do it you have to lend a hand but of course he isnt a woman and there are not many men who would do as much as he does psychologist janet riebstein who lectures on families and relationships says that negotiation is the key the only way to make it work is to treat parenting like a business you need routines and clarity you need to say you are responsible from four till six or three days a week you are in charge if you change the boundaries and have no clarity all hell breaks loose the kids decide whos in charge and that becomes the routine my male friends who work from home dont seem to have any problem negotiating themselves a full working day nick makes his wife furious because although he is in the house he is never available to help with the children linda whose husband alex works at home while she looks after their three children expects him to go to his study and stay there till until he made an office in a small outbuilding in the garden they were getting right on top of each other we both like our space she says but you know what writers are like theyll do almost anything rather than write he used to come down every five minutes and make a cup of tea interrupting my day now hes got his work space its much better for us both alex is only required to help out with their three small children in a dire emergency and even that he admits he does with reluctance i just cant cope its partly resentment as its not my job from the fathers point of view there is very little to recommend fulltime parenting you will never get any credit from anyone as a man looking after children says frank who works parttime and does threequarters of the childcare you will get a lot of hostility the only credit you are likely to get is from other mothers who are going to use your example to complain to their husbands and thus alienate all your friends work colleagues will look at you with a mix of pity and disdain i have stood outside school gates for years without anyone speaking to me ever my husband admits he sometimes feels like a cipher with no value or purpose most fulltime parents both men and women feel that way at some time especially those whose career has been achievementoriented when you are in the thick of temper tantrums with children who refuse to eat hit each other and are still running downstairs at pm you never feel you are doing a good job as well as losing status the fulltime father gives up the benefits such as money to spend on himself and a room of his own with limited space only one person in the family is going to get a study most men caring for the children full time see it as taking time out from their career says dr riebstein author of staying alive a family memoir bloomsbury it is so much less socially acceptable for a man to have no career path at all whereas it is a choice that a woman makes the social devaluing of a man without a work role can come between a man and his partner over time it can create a problem dealing with resentment from the fulltime parent isnt easy when you know you couldnt hack it yourself coming back from business trips is a nightmare says rebecca i am always in the doghouse for a day or two he never ever asks me what i did who i saw was it interesting while im away he phones me every day to tell me how little the children have slept and how often theyve been sick every man i meet in the course of business who asks about my home arrangements is amazed you have a very understanding husband said one man whose wife divorced him because his work took precedence over his family i bet he thinks youre off having a great time i do consider myself and more importantly my children extremely fortunate in having their father looking after them this time together will lay down the foundation of their relationships for the rest of their lives since i have a flexible working timetable we have to work at creating a structured personal arrangement well probably have got it right by the time my husband gets another job some find the separation of work and family life essential but it would not work in our house and maybe i would not want it to sometimes im playing with the baby before her midday nap and i think about how i used to spend all day in an office looking at my childrens photos instead of tickling their feet for a parent working from home is ideal in many ways but it is easy to spoil by failing to negotiate with ones partner over time and yes that includes time for running,2003-04,result happy circumstance friend rebecca

almost a quarter of a century has passed since the specials were number one in the charts with a song that began youve done too much much too young youre married with a kid when you should be having fun with me referring to the kid in question singer terry hall went on aint he cute no he aint hes just another product of the welfare state strip away the macho posturing and the specials were as so often reflecting an aspect of life in their home city of coventry twentythree years on there are still plenty of mothers in coventry and elsewhere who are school age or not much more every year some teenagers in england and wales have a baby a few of these are married but are not and while attitudes towards marriage and sex may have changed since teenage mothers still feel looked down on by the rest of society researchers from coventry university have unearthed evidence of that after interviewing more than mothers who became pregnant before they were well before in some cases the researchers have produced two reports one on housing and the other on pre and postnatal experiences and although there was anxiety not to stereotype young mothers the reports point out that low selfesteem is rife rightly or wrongly the young mothers feel they are being judged by housing and health professionals as well as by older mothers on antenatal courses that in turn is dissuading them from accessing services to which they are entitled the bottom line is that this is impacting on their children and it could be putting their health at risk says gayle letherby deputy director of the universitys centre for social justice and spokeswoman for the research team coventry primary care trust pct has already taken on board recommendations from the first report about changing the design of its semisupported housing accommodation where mothers with nowhere else to go can stay with help from support workers until they can find a permanent address as a result of the second report the pct is drawing up a training programme for health professionals who work with young mothers midwives health visitors nurses and doctors are expected to take part we want to challenge the stereotypical views that many of them admit to having when dealing with this group says kirsty reid teenage pregnancy support coordinator we also want to involve young parents and perhaps challenge their view of health professionals letherby believes that misunderstandings are at the heart of the issue as the second report says communication between young women and health professionals is affected by stereotypes on both sides some young women having internalised the dominant negative discourse of teenage pregnancy and motherhood expect to encounter judgmental attitudes and some health professionals are suspicious and critical of young pregnant women on the issue of smoking during pregnancy for instance a health professional is quoted as saying you ask them if theyve given up and they say yes but you can smell it on them some will say theyve cut down but whether they have or not this against a comment from a young mother they always ask you if you drink or smoke she says but if you say no they stare like they dont believe you anyway so whats the point in asking ive never smoked in my life but its like they think oh youre a pregnant teenager you must smoke politically teenage pregnancy is receiving more attention than ever before past claims that teenagers were getting pregnant to acquire a council flat have given way to what appears to be a more constructive approach from new labour letherby however is critical of the continuing projection of the nuclear family as the ideal and the consequent linking of all teenage pregnancies with social exclusion like older women she says sometimes these pregnancies are planned and sometimes theyre accidents in our experience though the vast majority of babies are definitely wanted is there a danger that she could be seen to be encouraging promiscuity at a time when britain continues to have more teenage pregnancies than any other country in western europe its important that young women dont feel pressurised into relationships they dont want and have access to the right contraception letherby says at the same time its important that those who become pregnant are not stigmatised were not supporting promiscuity were telling it like it is the specials would have said much the same halfway house where children become parents lois has eight gcses of grade c and above she also has a monthold baby called abbie conceived when lois was and staying at her aunts house in yorkshire i didnt tell my parents until i was five months pregnant she says my mums ok now but theres no way i could have lived at home at that time so when lois moved back to coventry she stayed with the parents of her partner five years her senior we went to antenatal classes together she recalls but everybody was in their late s or s i had the feeling that they were all looking down on us mind you the midwife was lovely when abbie was born it was very difficult with a small baby in somebody elses house so i was really glad to get a place in here she adds gesturing around the communal lounge at acorn court tucked behind lacewindowed semis in a pleasant coventry suburb seven mothers aged between and live here with their children each has a selfcontained flat rather like those in student halls of residence except that there is a cot in every bedroom this is one of two semisupported housing projects in the city run by the charity nacro which is extending its work beyond the care and resettlement of offenders into other areas of social exclusion i suppose you could call it a halfway house says project leader lesley

one of the problems that have dogged successive governments wanting to help mothers return to work has been the limited availability and high cost of formal childcare two years ago the daycare trust charity declared that britain had the worst childcare provision in europe based on the availability of publicly funded nurseries and ease of parental leave according to the trust the typical cost of a nursery place for a twoyearold is a year in london which is more than the average household spends each year on either food or housing further official estimates suggest there are only registered childcare places for the million children under eight in england new research from economists arnaud chevalier and tarja viitanen presented last week at the annual conference of the royal economic society held at warwick university indicates that a quarter of all mothers of preschool children are not able to access the type of childcare they would prefer and childcare subsidies aimed at helping them combine work with bringing up a family do not appear to help because of this unavailability of preferred care this is because in the language of the economists the supply of formal child care is inelastic to put it in ordinary terms while it has always been assumed that if demand for childcare increased then the price would rise and so would the supply the reality does not follow the theory using data for britain from the s chevalier and viitanen based at the institute for the study of social change at university college dublin argue that the supply of formal childcare does not react to an increase in demand as it should although a rise in demand does lead to a price increase this does not in turn produce an increase in supply as classical economic theory would predict but leads to the formation of a queue for the care that is available the researchers found that of mothers of preschool children were not able to get the nursery place or some other form of formal childcare arrangement that they desired informal care defined in this context as childminders was more pricesensitive and did become more available as the price rose the study found but most mothers did not regard this as an adequate substitute for goodquality nurseries and other forms of more formal care what is needed the researchers argue is a systematic policy of market intervention to extend provision of nurseries cutting the queues and increasing use of childcare because many mothers do not see formal and informal childcare as interchangeable the study suggests an expansion of the former would not lead simply to people transferring from the latter rather it would free nonworking mothers from fulltime caring for their children and enable them to participate more fully in the labour force further information from tarjaviitanenucdie,2003-04,one problem dogged successive government wanting help mother return work ha limited availability high cost formal childcare two year ago

emma and richard beagley from twickenham middlesex are typical of many middleincome families most of what they gain from new child tax credit they lose in extra national insurance add their recent council tax increase and the beagleys and their two young children daniel five and imogen three are worse off than a year ago almost all of the changes to affect the beagleys and other familes were announced last year but came into effect this month despite mr beagleys a year as business development manager at a local advertising agency the beagleys see themselves as a struggling family always overdrawn by the end of the month i know richards takehome pay of about a month sounds a lot but it doesnt go far living where we do says mrs beagley who is taking a long career break while her children are young high house prices in southwest london mean weve got a mortgage on our three bedroom semi so we pay out over a month on that alone plus on council tax this month the family whose income was too high to qualify for previous state benefits can get the child tax credit which is payable to all families with incomes of up to this benefit replaces all previous meanstested incomerelated support for children into a single payment made direct to the main carer usually the mother it is paid on top of universal child benefit which goes to all families with children regardless of income and which has just gone up to per week for the first child and for each subsequent child the beagleys will get ctc of a week a year almost cancelling out this is the national insurance rise announced in last years budget which will take nearly a month from mr beagleys salary from this month ni goes up by to on annual earnings above and for the first time people earning above the ceiling of a year pay a rate on all their earnings above that figure i feel the chancellor has done nothing for us except land us with a lot of paperwork which we have to fill out to claim the child tax credit in order to end up with virtually the same money as we had before says mrs beagley and were actually worse off if we take the extra money were now paying on council tax into account i feel that every labour budget seems somehow to make families like us a bit worse off though i do approve of what the chancellor has done for pensioners this time,2003-04,emma richard beagley

david ruthenberg is a consultant clinical psychologist he recently started working four days a week and spends the fifth day friday developing baobab the business he has set up with his wife janine robinson baobab wwwbaobabcouk is a mail order and webbased company specialising in handmade organic childrens clothing the couple have two children since ive been working four days rather than five my overriding feeling is that of relief i feel that four days in the nhs allows me to focus on the aspects of psychology i find interesting and to do them better by narrowing my activities to matters of importance i feel more authentic personally and focused and sharper professionally when it comes to administrative matters of which there is an unstoppable excess i feel more justified in cutting and culling surprisingly i feel that my professional identity is better defined and i feel less resentful and happier going to work in the very differently hectic friday i come across the other socalled real world here i find a confrontation with hidden obscure or assumed weaker areas of my nature im discovering different parts to me not always flattering but by being forced to use these dormant qualities i use more of me working from home on fridays has a totally different feel and the children undoubtedly sense this though there is possibly less actual time the fact of being and feeling at home creates a sense of containment for myself and the children which is irreplaceable it will take a financial catastrophe to get me back to fulltime work jill valentine above works as a skills for life manager special projects at ufi university for industry in sheffield she has a twoandahalfyearold daughter mollie and works three days a week monday tuesday and thursday on monday morning the reality of my split life begins with mollie still sleeping i face the dilemma do i wake her up at to give her plenty of time for breakfast or is it better to give her extra time to sleep having left mollie at nursery i arrive at the office just before nine and im straight into another world the phone rings its john from the department wanting to arrange a meeting the minute you announce youre parttime with some people you immediately get the i didnt realise you were only parttime response and with that your credibility mysteriously takes a nose dive if you fail to mention it your colleagues continue to be impressed that you are so busy that it is almost impossible to arrange a meeting with you as almost all wednesdays and fridays are booked up for the next few months now that i work parttime i am more focused on projects that dont need me to travel the country as much the projects i work on therefore tend to be less high profile i recently had to give up a project on prisons and im currently focusing on research i work with jobcentres plus making sure that they know about our skills for life courses so that they can refer people to our learndirect centres i work on europeanfunded projects promoting skills for life and i also work on building strategic partnerships with organisations such as the campaign for learning working monday tuesday and thursday is guaranteed to confuse if you work parttime a lot of energy goes into deciding which days to work i know three other people who work the same days as me mondays tend to be quite popular because people do like to get the bank holidays as well jo whitehead is an intensive care nurse she has been nursing for eight years and has just returned to work one day a week andahalf hours following ninemonths maternity leave after the birth of her daughter rosie i enjoy working one day a week i devote most of my time to motherhood but i am now also keeping up the skills i have worked to achieve over the past eight years i do feel a little out of the swing of the working week but this is probably because i have only just returned to work and working irregular shifts means i have no routine to be honest there was never a traditional working week for me nurses have always worked a combination of nights days and weekends i do feel less part of the team because i am there so infrequently how i feel about work very much depends on the time i have had with rosie if she has been fractious i feel guilty about leaving her but also relieved to have a break if she has been really fun then i feel i am missing out but i am much happier to leave her i always enjoy work once i am actually there my husband usually looks after rosie when im at the hospital but if we are both working then my mum and dad or my husbands parents are also keen to help i realise i am exceedingly lucky to be in this situation the money i now earn works out at just under third of my previous salary full time is hours a week i used to do that over three shifts a week with one study day a month i know it is a cliche but i love the feeling that i actually help people and not in some abstract way at the end of my shift i almost always feel that i have achieved something positive that day while rosie is so little i want to be with her as much as i can be so i wouldnt work two days a week from the point of view of my job working two days would be far better than working one day a week i am not going to get promoted working so few hours,2003-04,david ruthenberg consultant clinical psychologist recently started

working parents received a big boost in employment rights yesterday with the introduction of several pieces of family friendly legislation the government aims to improve the worklife balance of mothers fathers adoptive parents guardians and foster parents of young or disabled children with new laws on flexible working maternity paternity and adoptive rights sue ashtiary head of employment at law firm nabarro nathanson says the strong emphasis on joint parental responsibility among men and women signals an unprecedented shift in attitudes towards parenting the biggest difference is that it takes away the idea of worklife balance as a womens issue she says thats a big piece of social engineering and there could be a sea change in the way companies and people work for the first time there is now a statutory requirement for employers to provide paternity leave for fathers of children born on or after april the leave has to be taken within days of the birth and as one solid block maternity leave and pay has been extended so that mothers can take up to weeks maternity leave receiving a week or up to of earnings all other rights such as company car holiday rights companywide pay rises etc continue to accrue women who have already worked at a company for weeks or more before becoming pregnant qualify for a further weeks of additional unpaid leave making it a total of a years leave adoptive parents are also eligible for the same rights for the first time as are same sex parents guardians blood adoptive and foster parents with children under the age of six or a disabled child under the age of gain unprecedented rights with the introduction of flexible working rights this enables people to request flexible working arrangements from their employer and that request has to be taken seriously mike emmott advisor at the chartered institute of personnel and development thinks it is one of the most farreaching pieces of employment legislation this government has introduced the right to flexible working is going to have a bigger impact on employers than anything in a long time he says worklife balance is the single biggest workplace issue around at the moment and this legislation will really make employers think about that flexible working hours are more important than money for nearly a third of people looking for a new job according to a survey of jobseekers carried out last november on behalf of the department of trade and industry it found that of parents with children under the age of six regard worklife balance as an important factor when deciding whether to apply for a new job many employers are aware of this and realise that if they want to recruit and retain the best staff flexible working practices have to be an option patricia hewitt secretary of state at the department of trade and industry who is spearheading the reforms says forwardthinking employers are already making steps to comply with the legislation as i go around the country i am very struck by the number of employers who raise the issue with me themselves as they talk about the war for talent she says for this reason i think the majority of employers will offer familyfriendly working under the flexible working procedural requirements regulations legislation any employee with a child under six or a child with a disability under are allowed to request a change in three key areas a change to the hours they work a change to the times of the hours they work andor a change in the place of work for many parents it could be as simple as starting work at am or am instead of am so that they can drop the kids off at school the legislation makes it very clear what is expected of employers and employees when a request for flexible working is made and both parties have to follow the procedure to the letter the employee needs to put the request in writing stating clearly what working arrangements they would like when they want it to come into effect how they think the new arrangement would or would not affect their employer and how to resolve any issues employees can make only one application a year regardless of whether or not previous applications have been successful if the employer agrees to the request they have to inform the employee within days if they want to discuss the request they have to notify the employee in writing and arrange a facetoface interview within days the employee has a right to be accompanied by a colleague or trade union official after that meeting a decision must be made and issued in writing within days there are only eight grounds on which an employer may refuse the request they are the burden of additional costs it would have a detrimental effect on ability to meet customer demand inability to reorganise work among existing staff inability to recruit additional staff detrimental impact on quality detrimental impact on performance insufficiency of work during the periods the employee proposes to work planned structural changes should the employee disagree with the decision he or she has a limited right to appeal the employee cannot challenge the employers business reasons says ashtiary they can only say they didnt follow the correct procedure such as not letting a representative accompany them to the meeting or they can say the decision was based on incorrect facts but what is meant by incorrect facts it is quite a grey area for example is it a fact or a judgment to say whether it will have a detrimental effect on quality or if youre a supervisor and you wont be in on fridays to supervise will it affect quality however ashtiary thinks that the legislation is set out in such a way to try to avoid such situations occurring according to her and other employment experts the emphasis on joint responsibility on both employers and employees to consider the effect of flexible working on business performance should strengthen the employees position providing they make a good business case some critics of the legislation disagree with the introduction of worklife balance initiatives that so explicitly favour parents and parents alone we think the legislation should have been broader because there are many more sources of pressure on people than just bringing up small children says emmott theres caring for older children or elderly relatives for example emmott is also concerned that the legislation will be divisive causing childless professionals to resent the flexible working options granted to colleagues with young children however hewitt says it would not be practicable to have extended the legislation to encompass all employees as far as the law is concerned we were right to say it is about parents with young children or with disabilities because it is important that children can grow up well she says if we had tried to legislate for everybody it would probably never have happened some employers are taking matters into their own hands and making flexible working available to all employees communications provider avaya for example has just made it company policy to allow all employees to request flexible working be they parents or not emmott thinks any companies doing this will reap the benefits as much as their employees will we know that when people have a good worklife balance they have a better attitude towards their job he says they are less likely to make mistakes take sick leave or actually leave but given the current economic climate and pressures on businesses and employees to achieve maximum output ashtiary says it could be a matter of wait and see as only the most enlightened companies might truly embrace flexible working practices at the moment,2003-04,working parent received big boost employment right yesterday

so we are told that the government is taking domestic violence seriously under plans announced at the beginning of the week men convicted of beating their partners are to be placed on a national register modelled on the onefor sex offenders enabling police to track their movements and warn new partners of their past those on the register would be forced to inform local police when they moved home and the list would also be made available to the nhs and social services any move to formalise domestic violence as a major and actionable offence is of course to be welcomed placing it on a par with what is perceived as the most abhorrent offence of our age paedophilia is certainly significant and those who formulated the proposal believe that it will affect public opinion dramatically it would be even more significant if it heralded a muchneeded shift in focus away from the current disproportionate emphasis on street crime which obscures the fact that of violent crime involves a person known to the victim but even before it has begun this register is too little too late in the current context of sentencing for domestic assaults how effective a deterrent can it hope to be although every week in england and wales two women are murdered by a current or former partner it is estimated that only one in five incidents of domestic violence is ever reported fewer still lead to prosecution and only a handful of those result in a custodial sentence of six months or more the qualifying requirement for inclusion on the register in practice the register will only include a minority of the most violent offenders and as one refuge worker put it those stupid enough to get caught agencies dealing with victims of domestic abuse have already suggested that the register would be more effective were it to take into account civil proceedings they estimate that double the number who go through the criminal courts will use the family law act to obtain nonmolestation or residence orders which they find a less stressful and more effective way of dealing with their situation but the current proposals for what is necessary for registration appear set to be as unreflective of the situation on the ground as possible according to civil libertarians the idea that punishment meted out by the courts is not always sufficient sets a dangerous precedent in what other cases would we be willing to deny individuals their right to a clean slate effectively extending their punishment indefinitely these groups have expressed concerns that registers for everything from burglary to shoplifting may follow but tracking by scotland yards hate crimes unit has found that domestically violent men have one of the highest recidivism rates of any offenders and supporters of the scheme argue that we have a duty to protect future victims registration however brings its own difficulties will it as has happened with the sexual offences register feed the notion that domestic offenders are all of a particular type diverting attention from the less palatable truth that violence can happen in any home on any street regardless of race class or education registration also suggests that domestically violent men cannot change their behaviour research by the home office would appear to support this but many academics question these results arguing that the sample used men mandated to attend therapy by the probation service arguably the most violent and intractable individuals was too selective independent evaluation of domestic violence intervention programmes has found that men can and do change but the kind of intervention that works takes time and it doesnt come cheap there is a danger that the operation of a register will simply divert resources from these already chronically underfunded programmes there is also the question of how a register affects daytoday policing policy the centrality of a proarrest policy has been a regular theme of home office guidance on domestic violence in recent years but in practice it remains extraordinarily patchy across the country the womens support charity refuge believes that a concerted arrest and charge strategy would have far more success in preventing domestic abuse than the stigmatisation of a minority of offenders after the fact we dont need more legal remedy but rather adequate implementation of the laws that already exist critics argue that a register does not attack domestic violence at its roots nor does it contribute to our understanding of why it happens in the first place this is a grossly underresearched and underfunded area determinant factors are still only sketchily understood while resources that provide women with options to leave the relationship or to stay safely remain limited those proposing the register believe that it will help to alter public perceptions of the crime by shifting the stigma from victims to perpetrators but is stigmatising the abuser really any better than shaming the abused there is a growing belief among professionals that the naming and shaming of paedophiles simply increases the likelihood of their reoffending by further isolating them from support structures the sex offenders register has demonstrated the limits of the concept interagency tracking is beneficial but how practicable is it to intervene in an offenders future relationships balancing our responsibility towards a potential victim against an individuals right to a private life is a tough call better surely to work towards a situation where it does not take on

the government is planning a domestic violence register to monitor men who have convictions for abusing their partners it has emerged it would be modelled on the sex offenders register and could be used to warn women if they were at risk from a new partner campaigners welcomed the proposal but warned that it would tackle only the tip of a very large iceberg because most abusers are never charged katja mahnkopf the policy and communications manager for womens aid said it sends a strong message that domestic violence is not acceptable clearly the intention is to ensure the safety of women and children but it also shows that the perpetrator is being held accountable she said that it would help to protect victims who were followed by their abusers when they moved to a new area by alerting local police but she warned that proposals to inform women that a new partner had a history of violence needed full discussion there are many other measures which need to be put in place to help women such as access to information and support and advocacy services if they decide to take someone to court she said the home office confirmed that the government would publish its domestic violence consultation document next month but refused to discuss its contents details of the proposals contained in a document drawn up by the association of chief police officers acpo and the crown prosecution service were published by the times yesterday the register would hold the details of anyone sentenced to six months or more for assaulting their partner signatories would have to inform the police when they moved the register would also be available to doctors nurses social services and other bodies which could decide to warn a new partner some employers such as the police and social services could check job applicants against the register jim gamble the assistant chief constable for the national crime squad and acpos lead officer on domestic violence told the times that abuse was never a oneoff if someone gets a custodial sentence we need to monitor them after their release and assess the risk to the wider community to former partners and to new partners he said domestic violence has one of the highest reoffending rates of any crime two women are murdered by a partner or former partner each week there are thought to be incidents of domestic violence in england and wales each year experts estimate that only one in five of these is reported to police and many women subsequently drop charges richard garside of the national association for the care and resettlement of offenders said they are talking about tackling the tip of a very large iceberg by putting some people on a register there are many people who in the privacy of their own homes will hit their wives and girlfriends and will not get caught if you are serious about tackling domestic violence you have to think beyond prisons and courts and judges mark littlewood director of the civil rights group liberty warned that a register would create peculiar contradictions a putative partner would be informed if i had beaten up my previous wife and done six months for it but not if i had murdered someone he argued that inclusion on the register should not be an automatic consequence of conviction but decided on by the judge in each case,2003-05,government planning domestic violence register

parents are you paying attention sitting still the sitting part is important and you should probably take a deep breath as well because the figures you are about to read could take your breath away if you intend to put your child into a day nursery through private education then support them through university you will face a bill of at least calculated using the quoted costs of day nurseries and the sfia school costs calculator on wwsfiacouk thats if you live outside london choose the cheapest day schools and just pay fees not board once they reach university if you are unlucky enough to live in london where nursery fees are much higher select the most expensive boarding schools and give your child full support while in higher education you will face a staggering cost of its not just the privileged few who have to worry about such costs private education can start when your child is just a few months old the government is pumping billions of pounds into providing preschool childcare million this year billion next year and bn in all children aged four are offered a nursery place and the same offer will be made to all threeyearolds by next april but these places are parttime just twoandahalf hours a day so mothers who want to return to full time work have little option but to pay for private childcare as a result the day nursery sector is now worth bn a year according to healthcare analysts lang amp buisson although most people seem to worry about how they are going to meet school fees the cost of childcare under the age of five can be far higher the national day nursery association says there are children under the age of five at private day nurseries around the country with the parents of toddlers under the age of two paying an average of a week this equates to a total of over four years or about if you live in london however this is still cheap compared to the cost of employing a nanny an average of a year in london plus car and gym membership if you want to hold on to her in the home counties and about in the rest of britain according to tax specialists nannytax lets say over four years despite labours promises on election in to sort out state education increasing numbers of parents who were adamant their children would attend state schools feel that to give their children the best possible start they must go through the private system children now attend private schools compared with five years ago once hooked by the private system parents find it hard to quit ruth stedman of the independent schools council information service says surveys have found that parents value the smaller class sizes better facilities wider curriculum and stiffer discipline private school fees vary dramatically depending particularly on whether the school offers boarding facilities stedman points out that boarding schools charge more even for their day pupils because the school day is longer schooling may continue through saturday morning and there are usually a lot of after school activities included in the price nevertheless with fees for schools such as bedales in petersfield hampshire charging a term for day pupils and for boarders it is a hefty commitment a good place to start checking costs along with other aspects of the schools on offer is the website www isisorguk even if you are lucky enough to avoid the costs of private schooling and childcare theres always university to trip you up at the end the governments decision to allow universities to charge topup fees has dismayed most middle income parents whose children will not qualify for discounts but also do not have the family wealth to pay a bill of up to without considerable sacrifice the move has forced even diehard labour supporters to reconsider their voting habits while the conservatives have gained approval from the most unexpected of quarters the national union of students with their announcement that if elected they would scrap these fees however polls still indicate that many voters would rather pay more than suffer a tory government and labour has proved immovable on policies even more unpopular than topup fees recognising that most parents will face education costs in some form or other we look below at different ways to help you cope with the expense timing is everything in race to meet school fees many people do not have sufficient free capital to cover the entire cost of their childs education but hopefully most will have some savings when planning how to pay school and university fees time is of the essence the more time there is to save and invest the more flexibility you will have graham hooper of independent financial adviser holden meehan says that because the costs are due on a set date it is vital to keep a close watch on the performance of whatever savings or investment you use to make sure it stays on track its not like saving a bit extra for your retirement so you can have three holidays a year instead of two he says if you get this wrong it means you will have to find the extra cash out of net income borrow the money or worst of all take the child out of school immediate costs unfortunately many parents dont even think about childcare and education fees until the need is almost upon them if you have no capital and not enough income to meet the bill your only option may be to draw on equity in your home there are two ways to do this either by taking out one lump sum and placing the money in a savings account until you need it or by taking out a flexible loan that allows you to withdraw equity on a regular basis the former method may enable you to lock into a more competitive interest rate but does mean you will be borrowing more than you actually need immediately given that you cant remortgage every term to release a few thousand pounds instead david hollingworth of mortgage broker london amp country suggests offset and flexible loans from intelligent finance and standard life the if mortgage which has a standard variable rate of per cent discounted to per cent for the first three months works by offsetting any savings you have in if current and savings accounts against any outstanding debt this means you could apply for a bigger mortgage than you need at the outset but put the extra money in the if savings account so you dont pay interest until you need it the standard life mortgage allows borrowers to set up a cash reserve beyond the actual mortgage which the homeowner can draw on at the prevailing rate as and when he needs the money you can borrow up to per cent of your homes value so if you only need a mortgage for per cent you could draw down a further per cent for school or university costs up to five years before you need the cash use anything that is guaranteed or rocksolid says hooper he suggests guaranteed income bonds issued by insurance companies and paying a fixed amount of net income over a set period plus full return of capital gilts building society bonds and national savings child bonds which pay per cent gross plus a per cent bonus on the fifth anniversary make full use of your minicash isa allowance bradford amp bingley is paying per cent gross on or more deposited for a threeyear term while safeway is paying per cent gross on sums of or more with instant access five to ten years before youve got a bit more time but not much you still need to be cautious says hooper he recommends putting per cent of your savings into cash deposits per cent in equities through income funds such as credit suisse income or invesco perpetual income and the rest in the fixed and guaranteed schemes ten to years before you can afford to be more adventurous putting per cent in cash per cent in equities and the rest in the fixed and guaranteed savings mentioned above you could go for some weird and whacky scheme but i wouldnt hooper says youve still got a liability cropping up on a known date in the not too distant future he points out that the only thing that you wont know for sure is by how much the costs will have increased try to allow extra for the effects of inflation school fees inflation has fallen by per cent to per cent this year but it is expected to rise steeply next year to include the cost of higher national insurance on teachers salaries sweet surrender was the best policy heather scotts son blair has attended george heriots in edinburgh from the age of four heather who used to work at standard life and is now head of communications at intelligent finance has paid fees of about a month months a year out of net income this was not the most economic way because paying annually earns a discount but it was affordable this year heather who had several withprofits endowments with standard life decided the time was right to cash in her policies most life insurance companies had imposed market value adjustors penalties for early withdrawal of cash and although standard life had not yet done the same she thought rightly it was only going to be a matter of time i asked a traded endowment dealer if they could get me a better price but they said no so we decided to bite the bullet and surrender the policies instead of using the cash to pay off her mortgage she has put the money into an if savings account to offset all the interest she would have to pay on it she has drawn down on the equity in her property by extending the mortgage to pay the annual school fee minus discount for which she now qualifies but there is sufficient extra from the insurance policies to cover the interest on this sum as well so heather has exchanged making or losing money on her insurance policies for having an interestfree mortgage and school fees she makes sure the fees do not increase the size of the mortgage by overpaying the homeloan by a month even so she is several hundred pounds a month better off i was paying in school fees plus for the mortgage but now im paying to cover the

a dispute over care home fees in lincolnshire is to go to mediation after a court ruling that could have national implications for the longrunning argument over what local authorities are prepared to pay for residential care in the latest in a growing series of legal actions over the level of fees for statefunded care home residents the high court ruled that no fixedprice contract could be said to exist between lincolnshire county council and a group of local homes in dispute with the authority as a result of the ruling mediators will now try to forge an agreement between the two sides before the end of june the homes are claiming plus interest for additional payments for councilfunded clients dating back to last spring nick chambers treasurer of larch the lincolnshire care homes association involved in the dispute says the point of principle at the heart of the court judgment is so important that it could have repercussions throughout the country but the county council insists that its existing payments are reasonable and economically viable for the homes we now pay more than most east midlands authorities by as much as a week for specific care needs says sharon cuff strategic commissioning manager care homes across the country complain that they cannot provide adequate services on the fees being paid by local authorities under the community care system some homes admit to crosssubsidising statefunded residents by charging higher fees for those meeting their own costs the issue of low fees has been cited as a prime cause of the closure of many private homes with bed losses running at a year in lincolnshire larch says there is a gap of a week between what the council is paying and what is needed for viability but the council points out that it has signed contracts with homes accommodating of all the older and disabled people it funds if mediation in the dispute fails the homes will have to prove that the extra money they are demanding is fair and reasonable children in care almost children are now in the care of councils in england following a further rise in the total in the number has been growing since according to official figures at

every student of sociology has heard of willmott and young and their classic study of workingclass life in east london published in three years later researchers in swansea sought to replicate the study to see if the life of the welsh working classes differed significantly and found that it did not now researchers at the university of swansea have repeated that exercise to see how life has changed in swansea and by implication the rest of britain over the past four decades researchers nickie charles charlotte davies and chris harris last year contacted people covering an area identical to that in the earlier survey perhaps the biggest single difference they found was that the socalled coresident extended family had all but disappeared hardly any of the presentday respondents lived in a threegenerational household grandparents parents and children all under the same roof in one in five households in swansea could be described as extended family in it was just one in however the researchers did find that despite not living at the same address the extended family was still very much alive and well two in three respondents reported having had contact with a nonresident member of their family in the previous week only slightly down on the figure for and in spite of changing gender dynamics womens relationships especially the motherdaughter tie remained at the centre of these extended family groupings the researchers who reported their findings to the recent annual conference in york of the british sociological association found that the composition of swansea households had changed significantly over the past four decades there were slightly fewer containing a married or cohabiting couple and their children compared with in but the proportion of singleperson households had increased to from they also found that of households in were headed by a lone parent although no comparative data is available from it is safe to assume that the number then was considerably lower home ownership had also greatly increased since from to but those describing themselves as middle class had increased only percentage points over the period up from to however almost fewer described themselves as working class the difference being accounted for by a large increase in the other category including respondents describing themselves as human or are what you are another major finding of the swansea team was the decline in religiosity over the past four decades religion has long played an important part in the cultural and political life of wales and this was definitely still true of swansea in when of the sample said they had attended a place of worship within the previous week in this figure had fallen to just and of those questioned denied any

sal daquila is a former sheffield steelworker and looks the part his yearold son sal junior seems like any other sheffield lad in the film the full monty a bunch of sheffield likely lads turn to stripping when the steel works close down but the two sals and their colleagues pictured on this page have done something much tougher they have become nurserymen as in childcare workers the pay is peanuts the work is difficult and there are inevitable taunts of paedophile to overcome yet if britain is to solve its fastgrowing childcare crisis thousands more men will have to to follow their example the sheffield childrens centre looks after more than children from six months to years old and is unique in being the only childcare establishment in britain where half the staff are male and thats real men says chrissy meleady who is in charge of the staff not the ones with small glasses and sandals among those staff are tariq mamoud who arrived as a refugee and now has a clutch of childcare qualifications and a doctorate and yasser shafique originally from pakistan he has a business studies degree but switched careers and and is now taking a degree in child studies he works at the centre with two to fouryearolds for around an hour why do i do it because i love it he says ive always wanted to work with children and now i am im happy the theme of next months national childcare week from june is men in childcare stephen burke director of daycare trust the childcare charity organising the week says hes often asked why men why now a pragmatists response is because women are increasingly refusing to do the job as a result we face a real crisis in childcare last week a report by analysts laing and buisson revealed that childcare has grown fivefold in a decade and is now a billion business but only a minority are benefiting most nurseries are single establishment businesses which cant afford the economies of scale of the big chains so wages begin at below a year and reach only for a nursery manager working very long hours women can do less and earn more stacking shelves in asda or they have other aspirations we face a major policy issue which men in power appear unable to see says peter moss professor of early childhood provision at the university of london womens position in society has been revolutionised so if they will no longer do the caring for peanuts who will could this change force new thinking and major reforms in an area which has been neglected for decades saw the launch of the governments national childcare strategy promising good quality affordable childcare in every neighbourhood investment has been substantial yet still only one in seven undereights has a childcare place although a further bn will be spent in the next three years a doubling of the budget since labour came to power its not enough the gov ernment has set itself tough targets it wants to double existing childcare places to million by to do so it needs up to new childcare recruits the aim is to widen the pool by increasing the proportion of men from under per cent of the workforce to per cent and that is a goal it hasnt a hope of fulfilling unless it seriously addresses the substantial cultural shift needed to accept strange men anywhere near the playpen and reconsiders the question of who pays the bills involved fathers are accepted but when it comes to working with other peoples children that raises all sorts of issues says ann longfield of kids clubs network if a parent walks into a nursery in which five men are employed the initial reaction is still why do they want to be with babies chrissy meleady agrees we visited another nursery and we were welcomed with here come the paedophiles at her centre all staff are vetted cctv is used and two members of staff have to be present during all intimate care this is to protect children and the staff says meleady dr clare cameron co author of a report men in the nursery published last year says gender differences are deeply embedded women are the point of entry in recruiting in the staff room in deciding how the nursery is run while female staff are welcoming its about the unconscious assumption that there is only one way to care and thats a womans way in sheffield men are viewed as active participants not womens helpers the vocabulary is gender neutral tom scott used

women are waiting longer to have children and then settling for fewer babies than they intended according to figures released yesterday research from the office for national statistics suggests that the number of women who want to have babies in their early s is declining in more than of women aged to said they expected to have a baby within five years that figure has now dropped to but researchers have also discovered that women are ending up with fewer children than they hoped for changing circumstances such as work higher education the preference for cohabitation over marriage and the instability of relationships can mean many women being deflected from their plans figures also show that as women progress to middle age those who defer child bearing to achieve higher educational qualifications may face additionally caring for parents or inlaws as well as children a situation labelled twoway care or the caring squeeze women with higher qualifications are more likely to be affected this way than those without such educational achievements analysts found that women generally expressed the wish to have two children steve smallwood a researcher said the general message from the data for women under is that there has been and continues to be a trend of postponement of child bearing the longer you postpone the less time you are giving yourself for what you want to achieve there is a possibility that some of these women may have come to the end of their childbearing career with fewer children than they thought they would have roger wicks a research fellow at the social market foundation said it was likely that women scaled back the number of children through choice rather than circumstance mr wicks an author of the report lifelong parenting the changing shape of british family life said one of the key factors is the cost of parenting people can overstate their preferred family size but later read the runes they know their children are not going to be economically independent at one in four in their s have left home and have returned home twice or more he added that parents who might have friends with sons or daughters at home at the age of were making rational decisions researchers who examined the caring squeeze found that middleaged women with higher qualifications were more likely to have one child under still living at home the additional responsibility of caring for an elderly relative might occur for many between the ages of and the ons analysts said this was not necessarily a serious problem at the peaks of twoway care children will often already be relatively independent and parents will in many cases be at the initial period of the need for care before that need becomes more intense while the term squeeze implies an undesirable circumstance care relationships can have positive benefits for the carer as well as the care recipient especially when the relationship is of high quality much of the information released by ons will be seized upon by those who complain of social breakdown compared with the number of marriages in england and wales in fell divorces over the same period a total of rose there were live births in an increase of on the previous year but that figure may be seen as still strikingly low meanwhile mortality rates are falling in there were compared with the previous year and that

legislation to tackle domestic violence will be introduced this autumn the home secretary david blunkett promised yesterday the package will for the first time give police the power of arrest in cases of common assault make criminal penalties available for those who breach court orders and create a limited national register of those orders victims will also be granted anonymity if fear of identification deters them from giving evidence but a home office consultation paper published yesterday makes clear that several proposals which had been strongly backed by the solicitor general harriet harman are unlikely to be in the legislation when it is published later this year they include changes to the defences of provocation self defence and diminished responsibility in murder cases and plans for a national register of domestic violence offenders there was a broad welcome for the package when it was announced in the commons yesterday with mps from all parties expressing a strong commitment to tackle a problem which had often been regarded as taboo one woman in four will experience domestic violence in their lifetime every single minute of every day a domestic violence assault is reported to the police it can occur irrespective of background or circumstances race or gender but it is predominantly women who suffer said mr blunkett we are determined to do more to tackle this evil crime which devastates families and ruins lives domestic violence is often a hidden crime which victims suffer in silence and isolation the decision to make common assault an arrestable offence is designed to ensure that the police adopt a proarrest policy when they respond to a domestic violence call this will allow the police to find and arrest the offender if as is not uncommon he has already left the scene by the time they get there the register of civil orders will allow the police to check for outstanding orders against an alleged offender when they respond to a call but it has been decided to ask the law commission to report on proposed changes to the defence of provocation in murder cases it has been asked to report by spring leaving open the question of whether it will be in time for next years legislation responding to the proposals the torys shadow minister for women caroline spelman warned the government needs to be careful not to introduce unenforceable legislation in an area where lives need to be saved sandra gidley mp the liberal democrat spokesperson on women criticised violent partners still being permitted unsupervised access to their children in situations where a child was in potential danger this amounts to gambling with a childs welfare she said that criticism was reiterated by the nspcc and womens aid charities who said that since at least children had been killed in england and wales during contact visits andrew mcfarlane qc chair of the family law bar association applauded the measures to ensure the criminal and civil justice systems worked more closely together but the solicitors family law association insisted victims should retain the right to choose to use the civil system alone for many sufferers the need for a safe home for their children will be a more pressing priority than a criminal conviction to punish the perpetrator it said,2003-06,legislation tackle domestic violence introduced autumn home secretary

changing public attitudes is the most difficult task facing any government moving money between programmes is much easier but the past three decades have demonstrated that attitudes can be changed thirty years ago there was little public concern about child abuse now people from all walks of life have been alerted to the danger yesterday will be marked as the day when social attitudes towards domestic violence began to make a similar significant shift the ultimate aim is to ensure the public become as concerned about violence against partners as violence against a child all three main political parties signalled their support for a green paper on the issue published by the home office yesterday a draft bill has been promised for later in the year the first significant change in the law for years it is the biggest victory yet for the large intake of women mps who were elected in the political agenda is being feminised plain facts underline the urgency of changing the current law the british crime survey suggests domestic violence accounts for of all violence about incidents are recorded every year of the victims being women men surveys suggest women can suffer incidences or more before reporting their partners to the police about people are killed each year in these confrontations some of them women the effects on children can be equally serious making them fearful withdrawn and anxious about one in every six women seeking homeless accommodation for themselves and their children is a victim of violence they account for placements in the last seven years for all too many women home is not a safe or secure place to be yesterdays sensible package is three pronged it involves more prevention better protection and wider support it covers the spectrum from better

the home secretary david blunkett today announced wideranging plans to protect victims of domestic violence and ensure that people who beat their partners are brought to justice introducing the consultation paper safety and justice mr blunkett said one woman in four will experience domestic violence in their lifetime every single minute of every day a domestic violence assault is reported to the police it can occur irrespective of background or circumstance race or gender but it is predominantly women who suffer the government is determined to do more to tackle this evil crime which devastates families and ruins lives domestic violence is often a hidden crime which victims suffer in silence and isolation it has many causes many forms but it is important that the system is coherent and effective and able to help prevent such violence as well as tackling the underlying causes mr blunkett told mps that the government proposed to make common assault an arrestable offence the move would mean that suspected perpetrators can be quickly removed from the scene of an attack the use of restraining orders would be widened in cases where there was insufficient evidence for a criminal conviction but would be sufficient to justify safeguards being put in place he said the paper also proposes anonymity for victims and witnesses to make it easier to report cases specialist courts could be further developed and there would be consultation on the creation of a register of civil orders to enable police to know at the time of a domestic incident whether the suspect had breached an order and could be arrested stressing that sentences must reflect the crimes committed mr blunkett said that the law commission was being asked to look at defences offered in homicide cases the defence of provocation for example often relies on sexual jealousy as justification of murder this is not acceptable he said the first hour national helpline for victims was being set up and ministers would examine ways of ensuring it was the perpetrator of violence not the victim who had to move out of the family home mr blunkett said all too often victims suffered silently from this hidden crime he added the proposals also include spending m to create extra places at shelters for victims of domestic violence mr blunkett also said that he was consulting on a possible domestic violence offenders register but warned that there were practical difficulties which could stand in its way research showed that one in five young men and one in ten young women believed that violence towards a partner could sometimes be acceptable im sure everyone in this house will agree that this is never the case mr blunkett said the home should be a place of safety sadly for those affected it is a place of fear the solicitor general harriet harman said for too long women have had to put up with domestic violence and mens excuses have been accepted violence that takes place behind closed doors is no less serious than violence against a stranger in the street from now on domestic violence must be treated as the crime it is for the conservatives caroline spelman welcomed the announcement for bringing a taboo subject into the open she said it was appalling that there were more animal sanctuaries in the country than there were refuges for battered women however she warned that the government needs to be careful not to introduce unenforceable legislation in an area where lives need to be saved she added that the governments hour national helpline scheme which was announced last december was still not in operation the home office said that from today the consultation period will last for weeks a statement said the government wants to hear the publics views along with those from the voluntary sector and the professional agencies who deal with victims and offenders in particular it would like to hear from those who are or have been victims to learn more

the government must do more to protect working parents from pressure to work antisocial hours during evenings and weekends to service the needs of the society the joseph rowntree foundation said today after research into the availability of childcare the foundation found that most parents working nonstandard hours preferred to use childminders because they could provide a more stable home environment but a survey of childminders and nurseries by the thomas coram research unit at the institute of education in london found that few were prepared to take children before am or after pm on weekdays and most refused to provide a weekend service the childminders were often concerned about the impact on their own families if they worked longer hours the study found a few innovative services including a community nanny scheme but twothirds of the governments early years partnerships in england have not done anything to develop childcare services outside normal working hours as a result most parents working untypical hours rely on relatives and friends the report called for stronger action to protect working parents from the growing pressures of the hour daysaweek society ann mooney a coauthor said the overriding requirement is to consider the needs of children and to help parents balance their family responsibilities with the requirements of paid work we need policies for atypical hours childcare services but we also need to consider how employment policies and working hours should be made more family friendly so that parents have less need for care at these times she said june statham another coauthor said childcare services at nonstandard times of day cannot simply be bolted on to existing services it may be better to develop new types of service recruiting people without current childcare responsibilities rather than expecting existing providers to extend their hours,2003-06,government must protect working parent pressure work antisocial hour evening

the plight of battered husbands men attacked by violent partners is to be officially recognised for the first time men in abusive relationships are just as entitled to protection as women the government will announce in a major crackdown on domestic violence ministers want to help lift the stigma from males afraid of being considered weak if they admit to suffering the home secretary david blunkett and solicitor general harriet harman will unveil longawaited proposals for tougher antistalking injunctions against offenders and plans for moves to encourage victims to testify although police in england and wales receive a call every minute about violence in the home conviction rates are still alarmingly low but while the paper will make clear that women are still overwhelmingly more likely than men to be victims it will warn that attacks occur regardless of gender or sexuality the british crime survey of found per cent of those claiming to have been victims of domestic abuse were men of whom about half were attacked by female partners and the rest by other men the important thing is that we dont ignore that this happens to men as well even though it is majorly women who suffer said one whitehall source while campaigners have long argued that there is a desperate shortage of refuge places for women fleeing abusive relationships there is currently no domestic violence refuge at all for men in the uk one survey in found while most male domestic violence victims were bigger than their attackers women were more likely to use weapons such as knives or household scissors to make up for their lack of strength the subject is however highly controversial with womens groups who say many male victims of domestic abuse are gay men attacked by male partners rather than by women womens aid points out that a report from the scottish executive last year found that men who had been attacked in the home were less likely than female victims to be repeatedly assaulted less likely to be seriously hurt and that many of those who said that they had been victim also turned out to be perpetrators of domestic violence in the first place this weeks white paper on domestic violence will promise better coordination between different agencies such as police the courts social services and the nhs to protect adult victims and their children breach of nonmolestation orders is expected to be made a criminal offence to stop repeat offenders stalking their expartners officials have been redrafting molestation orders to ensure that in future they will apply to gay as well as heterosexual couples victims could also be granted anonymity in court in the same way as rape victims to encourage them to come forward and testify a register of offenders convicted of domestic violence is also likely but women will not be able to use it to vet new partners ministers will not publish the names for fear of exposing the victims to whom perpetrators are married or of encouraging vigilante justice ministers are also backing statutory murder reviews in cases of domestic murders to establish whether the couple were known to have a history of violence and whether more could have been done to prevent the killing,2003-06,plight battered husband men attacked violent partner officially recognised first time men abusive relationship entitled protection woman government

ian watkinson is married to liz they live in epsom with their two children luke aged months and rebecca months i was earning a year travelling around the world coming back to britain once every two weeks and dealing with contracts worth millions of pounds it was a company id set up myself and it was flourishing id married two and a half years before and everything was going smoothly until we talked about having children the sort of life i was living meant that i wouldnt have heard my childrens first words and almost certainly wouldnt have been able to get back in time to even see them born i had two choices i could see my children for four days every two weeks or i could look for a job that let me be a proper dad once i thought about it like that i didnt really have a choice if you want to have an influence on your childrens upbringing you have to be there to do it its far too easy to realise too late that youve missed your childrens youth and after all your children only develop once and need you to be there once i finished the contract i was working on at the time and came straight back home now i earn a third of what i previously made which was hard to get used to although i wasnt entirely stupid i made absolutely sure i had a proper pension and boosted my savings as much as i could beforehand i used to own a company with a turnover of m now i work for the it department of a company whose entire turnover is worth less than most of the individual projects i used to handle sure thats hard to get used to but once i got used to my bank balance and the lack of importance of my position i found the lack of responsibility an enormous relief being able to go home at pm and pass the buck on to someone else was hugely liberating our friends found it difficult to understand the choice i made some thought i was completely mad but if i ever get the occasional twang of regret for the excitement of my past job i realise that the rewards of watching my children grow up outweigh everything i have lost jon cooper below is and single with no children i was earning four times as much as a lawyer for a corporation in the leisure sector when i decided to move to a childrens charity as an inhouse lawyer it was quite unusual for a single man with no children in the world of law to make that sort of choice and no corporation would countenance the suggestion the corporate world of law is completely wrapped up in the english macho attitude that sucks as many hours out of its employees as possible mentioning that i was concerned about the quality of my life would have damaged my career to the point where i would have been thrown to the bottom of the heap its transformed my life im a happier and more stressfree person and i probably get more work done in my threeandahalf days in the office than most people do in five because i arrive at work each day feeling positive i can see the employers problem although flexible working hours increase loyalty and employee retention it can be a problem not having one finger on the pulse of every project theres also a problem in that even if public companies offer better working conditions than private companies they offer far worse pay so unless you have the luxury of being able to take a drastic cut in salary decent working conditions remain something that only happens to other people sam le rougetel lives in west london with his wife liz who owns intrepid consultants a consultancy firm with a m turnover shes due to give birth to their first child in september all ive ever really wanted to be was an artist and a painter i had a perfectly good career as a marketing manager before i married liz earning a fairly decent wage but after the marriage i realised that i could give it up and because she was so successful it would barely impact on our overall income liz is going to go back to work a month or so after having the baby and why not she loves working and is fantastic at it and because of her success i can now do exactly what ive always wanted to do too and why shouldnt i ive been working to earn money since i was and not wanting to while liz would hate to stay at home im happier than i ever had the right to expect i would be before i met liz after the baby is born im going to be a fulltime parent for the first six months and then the main carer for the rest of the childs life i feel hugely privileged that i can do that i cant think of a more brilliant way to live my life and i think most men of my generation would agree if only they were lucky enough to have the same choice ive got friends who are doctors and lawyers and theyre all a bit nonplussed by our decision but i think that when they see how happy liz and i are going to be when our family starts to grow and how happy our kids will be that theyll soon wish their careers were flexible enough for them to make a similar choice when that moment comes i really hope theyll press their employers to give them the option because its only by getting the momentum going that other men are going to have the options ive got,2003-06,ian watkinson married liz live epsom two child luke aged month rebecca month wa

rhian wheeler is so petite that she barely looks her years cheerful confident and full of energy she is also the mother of monthold scarlett and the exact opposite of the stereotype of a typical teenage mum having started back at college after scarletts birth and with only her final few exams left to go rhian is aiming for a career as a legal secretary and is bubbling with enthusiasm about her future its thanks to several factors that she feels this way a supportive family and her own positive attitude not the least of them from early in her pregnancy however rhian also had the backing of the stockport young parents project coordinated by alison lockley the project is one of five pilots established in by the department for education and skills the others being camden cornwall oldham and middlesbrough to see if providing support mechanisms would help parents aged to explore further education and training even thinking about going to college would have been a lot more difficult if it hadnt been for alisons help says rhian when youre pregnant youve got so much on your mind you just go oh ill think about college tomorrow and maybe youre a bit nervous too because on open days they have hundreds of people to deal with its not always easy to face that but i do my course fulltime now and more than anything its the childcare going to college would just be impossible without it access to childcare is the biggest obstacle to young mothers in stockport going further in their education believes ms lockley there are other difficulties such as identifying the right course and getting through the application process often they need help mediating with the college if problems arise but ive found that reliable childcare is the one key factor that has enabled teenage mothers to access education this project can fund whatever kind of childcare a mother is most comfortable with whether thats a private nursery or a childminder or friends and relatives initially the young women referred to the project often chose vocational courses in hairdressing beauty childcare and computer skills they are now extending their choices to a wider range of subjects including graphic design teaching qualifications sports science and health and social sciences ms lockley emphasises the importance of supporting young women to be fulltime mothers if that is what they want but points out that lone parenting is an isolating experience teenage mums may not exactly choose to be fulltime carers but simply fall into it through lack of options her own research shows that different groups of young mothers have widely varying attitudes to education some of the young women referred to me were absolutely adamant that formal education was not for them but you cant give up you have to try to keep a dialogue going because at some point in the future they might want to think again these efforts have been testing in the extreme the stockport young parents project decided that a policy of total flexibility in interpreting education and training was required for the hardesttoreach mothers and a series of workshops were set up in response to questionnaires the young women had filled in despite offering free transport organised childcare refreshments and a range of topics to fit in with their expressed interests the sessions were poorly attended it was clear that new thinking was needed interagency cooperation was prioritised with the aim of drawing on all the relationships teenage mothers had developed with the stockport youth service and the local irwell housing association by pooling resources and relationships there is now a fluctuating group of young women attending some form of educational activity every week workshops have been held on health and safety welfare benefits and first aid this may not appear to be proper education indeed ms lockley admits that its a small start and all the agencies involved are feeling their way certainly these mums are unlikely to be hopping merrily from babies to exams to gainful employment in the near future however she says once you get someone engaged in something then theres an opportunity which could be vital to that young woman later on there have been genuine success stories two of the young mothers supported by the project are now thinking seriously about university since teenage mothers and one teenage father have received direct services that have meant they could go on to college or vocational training but as rhian wheeler explains its when she thinks of starting a job without the personal and financial support offered by the project that life begins to feel precarious again the government will pay of scarletts childcare but ill still have to find around a month out of my wages and theres likely to be a backlog anyway that ill have to fund if i want to do any more studying ill be past the age for alisons project and im not sure how i would manage it the dfes has just announced that all parents aged to will have their childcare costs met in full as long as they are in formal education or workbased learning however ms lockley points out that this still leaves young mothers over who want to pursue further or higher education in a difficult position these are often very vulnerable people often not articulate or organised or able to deal with the system some colleges do offer childcare places but theyre limited and you have to work to get them thats why simply paying for childcare isnt the whole solution to helping young women restart their education often they need onetoone support and liaison between agencies as well as mediation throughout their college course to help them succeed,2003-06,rhian wheeler petite barely look year cheerful confident full energy

thousands of british children under are working more than hours a week to provide care for a sick or disabled relative while trying to keep up fulltime attendance at primary school according to evidence today from the childrens society and the ymca the charities found that children as young as five are spending longer than the adult maximum working week caring for a parent brother sister or other relative often with inadequate support from public services after analysing results from the latest national census they found more than children under providing more than hours a week of unpaid care for a seriously ill or disabled relative they included aged between five and seven between eight and nine and between and in the office for national statistics estimated there were carers under in the uk but the census found the charities said even this larger figure could be just the tip of the iceberg jenny frank young carers coordinator for the childrens society said it is staggering that children as young as five are spending more time caring at home than they spend at school too many children are caring too much too young there are also more than children aged five to seven providing up to hours of care a week aged eight to nine aged to and aged the figures were released at the start of carers week when the charities will be staging a festival for child carers in hampshire including a disco fireworks music festival radio station and talent contest the young people will also quiz mps on the inconsistency of support for young carers peter cooper south east hampshire ymca childrens work director said young carers have many more responsibilities than most young people and far less opportunities for socialising and fun the festival is the one time in the year that they can really get away from it all other charities will call on firms to offer more flexible working to the m employees with caring duties most british adults would like to see more men working in childcare according to a survey out today writes rebecca smithers one in four men say they would consider working in childcare but the suspicion they might encounter and the low pay prevent more of

men who want to work with children are being held back by sexist women according to a new report the claim comes as more men are considering careers in childcare in the wake of the new dad revolution handson fatherhood at home has become increasingly fashionable thanks to role models such as footballer david beckham as a result one in four men would now consider a job in a nursery or as a childminder for other peoples children rising to nearly four in among those who are fathers the research to be published tomorrow found but just as women breaking into maledominated professions may fall victim to an old boys network research found that some male carers complained of being patronised by female colleagues others feared that their sexuality would be called into question if they worked with children or that they risked accusations of child abuse one man was banned from cuddling his charges because it was not expected of men some men complained that they were excluded from some tasks but were expected to do others like rough play or fixing anything that got broken said charlie owen senior researcher at the institute for education at the university of london and author of the report mens work it reflects to some extent the gender divide at home where you might get the same arguments that the mothers would say he never notices when they need changing and the man would say im kept out of certain things they think ill just stick the nappy pin in the baby a small study by the institutes thomas coram research unit of men working in nurseries found some had been told not to touch children or change nappies in case parents objected one complained of being cut off by a female colleague who would interrupt him when he talked to parents while another two men reported that women colleagues would jump in before a possible problem could occur or would assume they couldnt do some things with the children properly the man banned from cuddling said that when he complained they changed the whole ruling and they said they didnt want anybody to cuddle the children the report concludes that recruiting more men would be good for children and reflects parents wishes for male role models the government will promise this week to treble the number of male professional carers over the next year lots of men look after their own children and so theres no reason why they shouldnt be paid to look after other peoples said alan johnson the employment minister who will address a conference on the issue on tuesday recent research by the equal opportunities commission showed that fathers now do about one in three hours of the childcare undertaken by parents even the prime minister tony blair has claimed he got up in the night when his children were small while his wife slept on a mori survey for the charity daycare trust which is also to be published tomorrow showed that per cent of parents would let a man look after their child while seven in wanted more male carers male nannies are becoming increasingly popular particularly with single mothers who want male role models for their children it also found that per cent of men would consider working in a nursery or outofschool club rising to per cent of men who were fathers themselves we are seeing some kind of beginning of a cultural shift said stephen burke director of the daycare trust now what we need to do is support men who want to go into this career however per cent of those asked identified fears of paedophiles targeting children as the main barrier to male childcarers even though only one man has ever been convicted of sexual abuse in a british nursery burke said fears could be tackled by proper vetting of nursery staff since when parents trusted the management they were inclined to believe their children would be safe around the staff,2003-06,men want work child held back sexist woman according new report claim come men considering career childcare wake new dad

in the beginning new labour put all its hope into early years education it was the way to raise standards in schools by having children well prepared to learn it was the way to raise scores at and gcse pass rates this was the great longterm hope to transform the social devastation of the tory years that left onethird of britains children born poor so in speech after speech now you still hear labour ministers extolling the value of sure start the dream was that a poor baby born under labour in would by the year have grown up filled with hope and opportunity those at risk of failing would be helped before they were born their parents helped to cope after birth with home support followed later by childcare to help every mother to go out to work the child would get not just quality care at all hours but nursery education of the best sadly it hasnt worked out that way for very many families of course the tories did not regard childcare as a state function at all which made it hard to get single mothers into work even nursery education was marginal experimenting with vouchers that failed at least labour from the start acknowledged the need and obligation of the state to provide this missing plank in the welfare state so one way or another often hand to mouth nursery education provision has soared by september all three and fouryearolds will get the basic minimum but childcare is another story according to the latest figures the daycare trust reckons it is only available for one in seven children and many of those places are private and far beyond the reach of most families there are separate possible funding streams for early years a nightmare for hardpressed nurseries to navigate because of the chaos of local versus central funding local councils are fiddling their books the results are often insane because there will be money for childrens centres m spread over three years only m this year kensington and chelsea council is closing wellestablished nurseries caring for children at risk ainsworth nursery is to be redesignated as a childrens centre to qualify for new funds but nearly all its children will be removed and put into a primary school only eight children will still get nursery schooling the minimum to qualify as a wraparound childrens centre and this fiddling and rebadging is happening everywhere it is hard to tell what is new provision and what is rebadged labour has not abandoned the dream but progress is slow as it failed to move early years to the top of the education agenda with all the public clamour from the middleclass lobbies for primary and secondary spending let alone more on universities there is little money for early years sure start is watered down to mean just about anything in many areas much of the new growth will be the rebadging kensington and chelsea is doing childcare tax credits have failed because they dont cover the true cost of childcare yet education ministers know the truth it is they who quote this shocking fact take babies tested for attainment at the age of months at one end of the scale is a very bright child from a poor home and at the other end is a dim but rich baby at just under two years old the bright child scores points on the scale while the dim one scores only but the two children are already on a steep trajectory in opposite directions the poorbright one travelling fast downwards the richdim one moving up as their social backgrounds counteract their inborn abilities by the time they hit nursery school aged three they have nearly converged poorbright scores only now while dimrich has risen to at the age of six the childrens lines cross and then diverge for ever more as they head off into opposite futures so anything that happens by the time they reach school is only remedial seeking to pull up the poor childs scores to where it began all education is running up a down escalator where the strongest influences on pupils success happen outside the school gates children only spend nine minutes of every hour of their childhood in school of success at age is due to social background not inherent talent these figures show how all extra money should go to children before they reach school catching them before the family effect destroys their chances as it is only of all the money spent on children from goes on sure start and the childrens

clara furse is the first woman to be chief executive of the london stock exchange and last week she made yet another assault on the record books when it emerged that her new salary package will total over m a year whatever the rights and wrongs of a salary that size it is progress of a kind for women there is also a touch of irony in that furse has risen to the top of a sector in which generally womens salaries lag far behind mens there is no dispute that furse deserves such a package in so far as anybody does in all likelihood she is not the first woman in the city to breach the m mark just the first obliged to make it public by weight of numbers finance ceased to be a mans world a decade ago the majority of workers in the industry are women by a slender but growing margin but the gap between what these women earn compared with men is far from slender the average hourly rate for women is barely half that of the male equivalent it is the widest gap in any industry the principal cause of this is that women are disproportionately spread between admin and management while they are the majority in the city only onefifth of them are in management the reason so many women choose to work in finance is the availability of flexible working at the end of the s when the highstreet banks began processing paperwork centrally overnight instead of in the branches the natural recruits to do the work were women who had had banking experience before leaving to have children they welcomed the opportunity to work parttime at odd hours today a third of all women in the industry are parttimers that same flexibility has not spread to management however which is why there are far more women at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top managers are paid a larger basic salary and also bolster their packages with bonuses hence the very wide pay gap in fact furses package makes the m mark through bonuses her basic salary is actually slightly smaller than her

recent legal changes have promised much for working parents extended maternity leave paternity leave and parental leave all sound as if they will be of enormous help to parents aiming to achieve the governments worklife balance goals but reading between the lines produces a different picture in fact there is little financial incentive for parents to take advantage of these new benefits april this year saw the dawn of paternity leave fathers with six months service at a company are now legally entitled to two weeks paternity leave for the first time sounds like a good thing yes but many fathers may less enthusiastic about taking their leave when they discover that their paternity pay is set at per week or of pay for those who habitually earn less than this the good news for dads is that most employers are ahead of the game with eight out of offering up to three days fully paid leave not all are as cooperative however according to support body parents at work some companies still warn staff that more than a few days leave will be detrimental to business greater and greater numbers of women are nowadays entitled to take maternity leave with entitlement recently extended to those who started their jobs six months before the th week of their pregnancy new mothers will receive support for weeks rather than the previous and leave will be granted for a further weeks meaning mothers will be able to spend a total of one year away from work however the second week period will be unpaid compelling most mothers to return to the office sooner than they might wish rachel roe legal adviser for parents at work which is calling for a longer earningsrelated pay period points out the difficulties that new mothers are facing mothers are returning to work early because they are so close to the line in needing their pay she says this year also saw the beginnings of what is supposed to be a more flexible era of work for parents and other workers although employers are now legally bound to consider parents requests for flexitime there is no evidence yet of any practical change despite predictions by the department for trade and industry dti that working parents will benefit from new arrangements lowincome groups are less likely to be taken seriously in requesting flexible working many businesses are unfamiliar with their new obligations and were hearing reports of kneejerk negative reactions from employers says roe this picture is backed up by research from the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd the institute reported last year that one in working parents said their employer did not understand parental responsibilities with manufacturing and production industries most culpable despite flexible working policies half the parents interviewed worried about having to leave on time particularly those in the service industry the private sector is meaner with flexitime with only one quarter of businesses offering it compared to of public sector organisations parental leave was introduced three years ago offering parents and guardians weeks leave until their childs fifth birthday or until a disabled child is up to a maximum of four weeks a year the leave remains unpaid however and parents must take a minimum of one week rather than a day at any one time according to the cipds mike emmott takeup has not been significant for short periods of time staff may play it by ear and take a day sick day or two in order to cope with something urgent he says working parents still face problems finding childcare with only of organisations questioned by the cipd offering a workplace nursery and childcare subsidies a figure which actually represents a fall from three years ago government plans to provide tax incentives for employerprovided childcare may increase work facilities from next april for now only of parents use professional childcare with high cost being the biggest barrier juggling is the norm for one in five working parents who manage to look after their own children and work while one in three depend on their partner and a quarter rely on another family member even with taking into account the recent changes people on lower incomes may be more reluctant to forego full pay in order to take maternity paternity or parental leave and men are particularly slow in taking up the leave to which theyre entitled with of males with dependent children still in fulltime work the number of women going back to work is growing with of women returning to the office within months of their childs birth in

women workers face a stark choice dont have children if you want to earn as much as men a major new survey shows that women who take time out to have children are likely to face lower wages when they return to employment compared with those who stay on the career treadmill low parttime wages coupled with higher salaries in typically male occupations also help to sustain the gap according to sylvia walby professor of sociology at leeds university and wendy olsen lecturer at manchester university the pair found that over a sevenyear period women who remained in their careers experienced a per cent increase in wages on average in contrast those who took career breaks to look after their families saw the increase drop by per cent a year for each year they were out of employment the findings suggest that employers are hardnosed when it comes to determining their workers salaries the importance of motherhood in womens pay is nil it is their labour market experience that counts olsen said the two academics whose work is being closely studied by the governments women and equality unit say the pay gap the largest in the eu can be bridged only by improving skills and training women returning to work the government puts a lot of effort in getting unemployed people back to work but not enough for women whose careers have been interrupted walby said men currently earn per cent more than women the average male worker earns an hour compared with an hour for the average female women in traditionally female occupations notably cleaning and secretarial work continue to suffer from low wages the survey found that women working in typically male occupations are paid an extra p per hour walby said it was up to the government to take the lead the uk has massively increased

more than twothirds of businesses in the uk could be liable for hefty compensation claims following changes to the equal pay act tomorrow according to new research a survey by business information supplier croner said that of businesses have not carried out an equal pay review which ought to show up any gender pay gap within the company businesses who currently breach the equal pay act are liable for compensation amounting to up to two years back pay changes to the act which are due to come into effect tomorrow mean that this twoyear limit will be removed leaving businesses liable to pay backpay in far greater amounts where they are found guilty of discrimination figures from the equal opportunities commission show that despite the introduction of the equal pay act in women are still earning on average less than men the gap is even wider for women who have to work parttime to meet their childcare commitments changes to the law this april mean that employees now have a right to ask for an equal pay questionnaire if they suspect they are being paid unfairly produced by the eoc the questionnaire allows employees to ask employers probing questions about salary bonuses and benefits in order to establish whether colleagues are being paid at a higher level employers are not obliged to answer the questionnaires according to the eoc more than a fifth of employers do not allow employees to share information about pay with their colleagues unequal pay is something which can easily go undetected if it is not monitored a regular equal pay review will highlight where a pay gap may be emerging and whether it is genderrelated said richard smith human resources expert at croner we recommend that all businesses carry out equal pay reviews to identify pay gaps so they

the year is britains pensioner population has reached a record high those able to give up work at the age of are the lucky few more than million people one in five britons are over the official retirement age of another eight million are in the final decade of their working life between and a legacy of falling birthrates and rising life expectancy the growing number of elderly people has a profound impact on society and its culture politics and public services the pressure on the nhs is intolerable with radical young politicians saying it has become a giant network of old peoples homes and an unfair burden on their wages the advent of the socalled superpill and a cure for cancer means average life expectancy has shot up to three million pensioners are now older than there are workers for every pensioner compared with double that at the turn of the century in the years leading up to the social barriers to older people continuing in work broke down out of necessity in servicebased knowledge industries lack of mobility is not a bar to work with many older workers operating from home severe tax penalties apply to people who take early retirement offshore retirement havens are in operation for those who want to stop working at a generational schism has emerged within politics frustrated whizzkids are rarely promoted as companies fear antiageism tribunals and the power of the elderly lobby advertising money is focused at grey power nike has diversified into the sale of artificial sports hips and a yearold britney spears becomes the face of este lauder a proposal to raise the retirement age to is pushed through parliament to head off the habit of early retirement at a free oneyear university course is offered to all yearolds to aid career changes former teachers retrain as doctors at the age of the alarming change in the countrys demographic structure in is summed up by one stark fact many workers preparing to retire this year began their careers as university graduates in this is a nightmarish vision of generational politics and the pressing requirement to work till you drop but such a picture of life in the s has its roots in the baby boom of the s as robert samuelson one of americas leading economists says we baby boomers are involved through our silence selfishness or ignorance in a conspiracy against our children young britons in would be forgiven for wondering what the ageing baby boomers whose pensions they are paying bequeathed them the pig in the pipe theory tracks the overwhelming social and economic effect of this huge cohort born in the late s and s as teenagers they pushed society towards liberalism and flower power in their thirties they benefited from the thatcher settlement of low taxes funded by assetstripping of britains public infrastructure and slashing investment in education health housing and transport in their late forties they took advantage of a huge surge in house prices and possibly stock markets and as they approach an early retirement they instigate tuition fees for students and higher taxes on working to finance the public investment they refuse to pay for meanwhile the next generation has to deal with a crumbling transport infrastructure unaffordable housing and rebuilding neglected health and education systems as well as working till to help fund pensions generations to come may question the selfishness of the baby boomers who benefited from free universities free health and dental care cheap prescriptions and mass housebuilding it is what might be called a generational robbery and the questions may have started last week with the first simmerings of a new generational politics where the young are pitted against the old cynics may argue that the demographic tyranny of an overwhelmingly older and retired electorate routinely imposing its political will on younger workers has finally arrived last week patricia hewitt the trade secretary floated proposals to solve britains pension crisis by upping the retirement age to this emblematic sacrifice by young workers is just a taste of how the ageing society will shape economics culture working life and british politics more broadly for example in april the treasury hiked taxes by the equivalent of p in the pound to help fund the nhs for the challenges of an ageing population the key statistic comes from the latest census figures for the first time there are now more overyearolds than unders over the past years there has been a fivefold increase in the number of overs and this is only the start of a trend the biggest spike of births was in and now theyre coming up to retirement and will live longer and potentially have a longer period of ill health says john pullinger executive director of the office for national statistics and responsible for the census across continental europe where demographic pressures are more acute than in britain there has been a tidal wave of strikes protest and counterdemonstrations about pensions provision from vienna to berlin to paris just as the fuel strike militancy jumped the channel three years ago pensions promise to be the touchstone issue for a renewed and vigorous union activism old europe expects its retirement to be well catered for but young europe is beginning to realise that it will foot the bill in terms of higher taxes or greatly extended working life austrian economists suggest that raising the retirement age to would be the only way to keep the pension system afloat as an increasing rump of the population goes into retirement the nature of politics will change with pressure for pensions to be increased martin weale of the national institute for economic and social research recently showed that over the past years grey power in the electorate has led to a seismic shift from economically sensible taxes on wealth such as housing to economically less desirable taxes on workers such as the recent hikes in national insurance anyone sceptical of the looming impact of a growing pensioner population should consider the situation across the channel in germany and france young politicians are working across party boundaries to push the concept of generational justice in germany a yearold jorg tremmel has started the foundation for the rights of future generations to campaign against what he calls generational fraud in pensions provision hanswerner sinn head of germanys ifo economic institute believes that the country has only a few years to take a last chance to change its pension system by the vested interests of pensioners will dominate german democracy the country will effectively be a gerontocracy only the fear that the young might emigrate or an altruistic attitude towards their own descendants will prevent the old from exploiting the young he says in britain there has been an almost systematic erosion of conventional forms of old age financial security the family state provision stock markets and now the housing market have all come unstuck the extended family unit used to be the ultimate pension scheme for the elderly but a rise in job mobility and family breakup has weakened previously immutable bonds conventional employer pension schemes were based on favourable demographics the contributions of a constant supply of productive young workers kept the coffers full for healthy pensions in europes pay as you go schemes but longer life expectancies and declining fertility have meant fewer workers supporting an increased number of retirees the dotcom boom deluded some pension managers into believing the demographic issue could be fudged indefinitely but the collapse in stock markets still per cent below their value exposed this faulty arithmetic so state pension provision has become vital as it stands relatively stingy pension payouts linked to inflation rather than earnings mean that the taxpayer cost of the system will actually decline over time as a proportion of national income but there are lots of additional costs related to an older society from nhs spending to meanstested benefits for pensioners the uk pension system is sustainable in terms of cost but not necessarily politically its relative stinginess means that present workers on average earnings of per year are heading for a retirement of prolonged poverty in britain at least workers have turned their homes into surrogate pension schemes a record billion was borrowed against the high value of british homes during the first three months of this year over the past year there has been a surge in equity release loans which target asset richcash poor pensioners with aggressive lending in return for their house at death sixteen thousand of these loans totalling a record million were advanced during according to the latest figures from the council of mortgage lenders a property pension is an elegant way of funding a high quality of life in retirement for lucky pensioners who have paid off their mortgages but pensioners who go down this route will become acutely sensitive to any fall in house prices many homeowners are withdrawing equity like this well before retirement raising the prospect of never actually paying off their mortgages millions more workers have no prospect of getting their feet on the property ladder let alone benefiting from rising house prices by continental europe and japan will have between and workers per pensioner britain will be in a slightly better situation with the ability of britain and the us to attract skilled workers will become a crucial economic trump card over other areas of the world but longer term societies adapt to their demographic structure ageing britain is likely to see a reorientation away from yoof towards the mantra of retraining and multiple careers consumer advertising may start to reflect the silver surfer generation fiftysomethings may become the new thirtysomethings careers will be peppered with breaks and retraining going to university twice becomes common fixed term marriage contracts become common the cachet of youth ebbs away and the baby boomers leave their final indelible footprint on british society senior services the health service will carry the brunt of britains growing pensioner population in future years as rising life expectancy means more people will need to be treated longer the burden of chronic diseases such as cancer will overtake the amount of acute infectious illness also children who are overweight and fail to shed the pounds in adulthood will be plagued by serious problems the demographic change will also have an impact on the nations cultural tastes television and films will be readier to put older faces on the screen saga holidays which

here we go the golden generation gets its greedy way again i long ago predicted that when we the great postwar boomers vulgarly known as bulge babies for demographic not fattist reasons reached retirement we would refuse to give up what weve got we would have antiage discrimination laws so that no one could ever force us out of our jobs so here we go or rather here we stay forever talking about my generation of course we didnt die before we got old we lived on and we had it all there never was a more fortunate time to be born in the west than just after the second world war consider how doors opened for us the national health was created in for us to be born into the butler education act made sure we had universal education comprehensives followed i went to the sixth form of one of the first full of hope and modernity the robbins report opened up a swathe of gleaming new plateglass universities for us making keele york or essex newly cool while the open university caught latestarters with our new buying power s youth stamped our tastes on everything when we were young the whole world had to be young with us growing up we lived through the greatest upward mobility ever known within a generation born some into manual working families by the time we married and had children society had reshaped itself radically now twothirds of us are middle class with homeowning as good a class indicator as any the nations wealth and average incomes have more than doubled since we left university our pensions may have staggered badly in the crash but after years of hefty tax breaks that form the unseen middleclass welfare state most people will still retire better off than our parents ever dreamed we are also the first generation where many will inherit significant sums from homeowning parents a windfall in late middle age that is hardly taxed for most money to secure our childrens wealth or to blow on oldage boozing and cruising thats the majority story but for the one third left behind manual workers suffered the tragic loss of heroic highpaid jobs in coal and steel replaced by lowgrade service work the class divide is harsh on retirement the right to work forever is a cruel offer to people cleaning floors or laying tarmac aching for the day they can pick up their pension if a secret plan lurks to raise the state retirement age it must never be for them but the lucky twothirds in our generation were always destined to demand the right to keep our jobs if we want now we proclaim that is the new just because we say so by law no one will be allowed to mention our wrinkles question our memories or notice our hair dye size matters in generations we the outsize generation always had the buying and the voting power to impose our will and tastes on all who come after brian matthews sounds of the sixties sots to aficionados will still be playing radio s prime time saturday morning slot when we are and brian matthew is about when we need care we will divert more public money to the best home care or care homes the weaker generations that come after us have not had it so good they have had a more competitive examdriven education the more people who take exams the greater the penalty for failure in our time when only one in seven went to university many more could still make their own way upwards without qualifications now exams are the only ladder up the young work harder than we did the colossal weight of ever higher mortgages falling harder on them how did it happen that all the megagrowth in national wealth has not given them an easier life where now the earnest debates about what to do with all the leisure that new technology would bring technology just makes overwork easier the nation may be rich but our children have a harder time than us because the wrong political choices have been made no one ever asked the voters if they would like time instead of money a threeday weekend perhaps instead of twice the income for them the era of social progress is over children of bluecollar families are no longer moving up soon the full weight of our generation will fall upon their frail shoulders less here than in the rest of europe but nonetheless with soon to be over they will work hard to pay our pensions and our care that is why encouraging us to work longer is in the end a policy that should ease their burden as well as please many of us luckily its winwin for both generations a third of yearolds dont work many are pushed out of jobs some jump with inducements others are seduced by saga brochures but may find their pensions fall short some retired assuming theyd get another job only to meet rigid discrimination in recruitment most men aged used to work but now half retire before the early retirement boom took off in the s encouraged by a government trying to solve its unemployment crisis but too late it found jobs are never a zerosum game losing jobs done by older workers did not create new work for the young unemployed economist professor richard layard says the lesson learned then applies now too more people staying on will have no effect on opportunities for the young thats not how labour markets work the us has had antiage discrimination laws and no retirement age for years research shows no illeffect on the next generation people working longer pay more tax add to national output and do better drawing their pensions later will offices be filled with forgetful ditherers the governments overview of the academic research into ageing makes encouraging reading work performance does not deteriorate with age a few older people show a marked falling off dragging down average scores but the great majority are exceptionally good employees yes they can master new skills and they work hard and more effectively think before acting have better interpersonal skills work better in teams are less likely to leave have lower absenteeism have better motivation fewer accidents more experience and better knowledge of their company so not crabby old geezers after all but precious assets whose memories are organisationally necessary not fading the cbi fears an avalanche of employment tribunal cases with all the trappings of antidiscrimination law but there is no other way as the previous code of practice made no impact only the law forces culture change us experience suggests few people do stay on after retirement age but it does stop people being pushed into it too early this will help women greatly ageism has been a covert discriminator against women all those returning to work after

people who overreact when defending themselves from an attack or an anticipated attack may be entitled in future to be convicted of manslaughter rather than murder the reform under consideration by the law commission could help householders like the norfolk farmer tony martin who use excessive force against burglars it could also be invoked by battered wives who suddenly snap and kill their husbands the commission the official law reform body for england and wales has been asked by the home office to look at the existing partial defences to murder diminished responsibility and provocation which if successfully pleaded cut murder to manslaughter and to consider whether self defence with excessive force should be added at present self defence is a complete defence to a murder charge entitling the defendant to be found not guilty but only if the amount of force used was proportionate to the threat if the force was excessive the defendant is guilty of murder critics of this law argue that in the heat of the moment it can be difficult to gauge how much force is reasonable while murder carries an automatic life sentence defendants convicted of manslaughter may walk free or face any sentence up to life imprisonment depending on the circumstances martin was convicted of murder but his conviction was reduced to manslaughter on appeal because of diminished responsibility his life sentence was cut to five years the review backed strongly by the solicitor general harriet harman as part of the effort to strengthen the law on domestic violence will look particularly at the use of partial defences in domestic violence cases but will consider their application to murder in general killing through a suicide pact and infanticide will not be included the commission will consider whether diminished responsibility and provocation should continue to be partial defences to murder and if so whether they should be combined in a single defence or remain separate the study will be backed by research in which people around the country will given a range of scenarios and asked for their opinions on them various options for reform will be set out in a consultation paper promised by the end of october the commission has agreed to produce a final report and recommendations by spring in time for amendments to be made to domestic violence legislation due to be introduced this autumn a claim for damages by brendon fearon the burglar shot by tony martin is to be heard between february and april next year a high court procedural judge yesterday fixed the trial window for the action being brought by fearon who recently won the right to sue martin for a reported damages for wounds he received during the breakin at the farmers home in emneth hungate norfolk during august the hearing is expected to take five days and involve legal arguments over the effects of a psychiatric disorder martin was said to have had at the time of the breakin raising the possibility of a

cheap childcare for poor parents should be extended to give more young people a better start in life a committee of mps urged today the government wants to cut child poverty by getting more lone parents back to work with fewer children being brought up in homes where no one has a job but high childcare costs sometimes mean it is not worthwhile for some parents to get off benefit and go into work the national average cost of childcare for a nursery place for one child is per week or a year ministers have already pumped extra cash into providing free or cheap childcare for the most deprived areas last week they announced pilot childrens centres in deprived areas providing childcare education and health services the plan is to eventually have over centres providing places for children from poor families but today a committee of mps published a report childcare for working parents calling for more government help the government has targeted extra cash for childcare on the most deprived of local authority wards the work and pensions select committee said it was extremely concerned that there were significant gaps in poor areas falling outside the worst off the mps want the government to extend its commitment to setting up centres in of the most deprived wards by and eventually have them in all areas the report concludes this would make an important contribution to

the million working mothers in britain have less than of their salaries left once they have paid for childcare and domestic help a survey revealed yesterday the average monthly takehome pay for women with children is after tax but they spend an average of on childcare and paying others to help run the home according to a study commissioned by british gas leaving just the study of working mothers found that most had to spend their salary on cleaners childcare gardeners and people to do their ironing four in had fulltime jobs and the remainder had parttime jobs but of the parttime workers had two jobs some of those questioned said they never spent their wages on themselves childcare cost an average of a month plus for extra cover for holidays and for afterschool clubs babysitters cost a month cleaners sports and clubs for children and guilt treats for children working mothers also spent an average of paying someone to do the ironing on a gardener on window cleaners and for presents for family and friends for helping out with childcare jenny watson the deputy chairwoman of the equal opportunities commission said this survey shows just how important it is for parents to be able to maintain a balance between work and family life not being able to achieve this balance has a heavy financial cost as well as the human cost of the stress many working parents face every day increasingly men want to spend more time with their families too this isnt just an issue for women it also illustrates how desperately britain needs a decent infrastructure of affordable childcare most women work because they need the money but if the majority of their pay packet is eaten up by excessive childcare costs they clearly have less of an incentive to work which will significantly

violent relationships are fuelling britains housing crisis as more and more people flee the family home in fear of attacks by a partner or a parent research based on government figures by the housing charity shelter shows that the breakdown of a relationship is now responsible for almost one in four homeless people ending up on the streets the research found that violence within the home is the cause of per cent of breakdowns in relationships with almost families losing their home last year for this reason up from with the previous year the increase has prompted concerns that local authorities are not doing enough to cope with the threat of relationship breakdown and its links with homelessness ben jackson director of external affairs at shelter said we knew relationship breakdown was a massive problem but we are concerned by the rise more needs to be done to understand the relationship between this problem and homelessness the nightmare doesnt always end when someone finishes a violent relationship or splits up with their partner the end of a relationship often marks the beginning of homelessness in total households have been rehoused due to relationship breakdown in the past seven years although experts believe these figures may be conservative because of difficulties in quantifying the problem melanie not her real name fled the marital home with her two children after suffering violent abuse from her husband for nearly a decade he put me in hospital on several occasions he broke my ribs and smashed a bottle over my head i know i should have got out earlier but i just couldnt she said in the end i went to stay with my sister i had no choice the council said that because i had left the marital home they couldnt help me when the council did intervene melanie was moved into a house in the next street to her husband who continued to abuse her both verbally and physically it got to the stage eight weeks ago where i wanted to commit suicide since then the council has promised to move melanie to a new area and her husband is now subject to a restraining order her case highlights concern among housing groups that many local authorities are illequipped to understand the links between violent relationships and homelessness figures vary according to region last year in yorkshire and humberside for example there was a per cent rise in homelessness due to relationship breakdown compared with an per cent fall in the west midlands shelter estimates that per cent of local authorities have no refuges to protect victims of violent relationships a further per cent offer such a service but have insufficient capacity local authorities must improve the way internal departments work together and with other agencies to ensure support is available if future homelessness for people already traumatised is to be prevented jackson said,2003-08,violent relationship fuelling britain housing crisis people flee family home fear attack

violent relationship breakdown is the reason given by nearly one in seven households for becoming homeless and at last the issue is being recognised by ministers as a major problem shelters analysis of government figures shows that that per cent almost of homeless households lost their home following relationship breakdown an increase of over per cent on last year shockingly nearly per cent of these were due to violent relationship breakdown new government initiatives that reflect this priority include an interministerial group with representatives from five government departments a recently published consultation paper safety and justice and million of funding to local authorities for the development of refuges over three years central to the governments own consultation paper on domestic violence is the opportunity presented by the new homelessness act for local authorities to dramatically improve their approach to domestic violence and housing a view wholly supported by shelter next month shelter will publish its third survey looking at how successfully the new homelessness act is being implemented at a local authority level it illustrates that in many cases there is still insufficient provision of services to meet local need per cent of local authorities asked had no provision of refuges or safe house accommodation at all and per cent had accommodation services in place but with insufficient capacity however the research also found that many local authorities are taking positive steps to develop the services they provide to victims of domestic violence trafford borough council has recognised that domestic violence is a key cause of homelessness and developed a prevention strategy in response to this it has formed a partnership with the local womens aid group in order to provide specialist support for those victims who chose not to move from the home where the violence took place this is recognised as a groundbreaking approach it also has expert provision on domestic violence within its housing advice service which enables women to plan for the future in a careful and considered way reducing the number of women applying as homeless at the local authority surrounded by their belongings in desperate crisis unfortunately not all local authorities are so forward thinking and this type of support and service is not available across the country what is needed is consistency consistently good practice across all authorities in their approach to domestic violence and homelessness shelter is asking local authorities to improve the way departments work together and the way they work with other agencies to provide adequate support services such as the example above one of our clients joanne suffered years of abuse at the hands of her husband leaving her and her children traumatised when at last she approached her council for help when her partner threatened to kill her joanne was let down at every stage initially she was told they couldnt help her for three weeks and to stay with relatives she explained that it wasnt possible and was referred to social services who reluctantly placed her in a hotel for three nights they then told her they would not provide further assistance the local authority rejected joannes application for housing and told her that she could go back to the home from where she had fled they did not make enquiries regarding the violence when she contacted shelter we enabled her to get an injunction against the councils decision and the family is now in a bed and breakfast waiting for a final decision on their case shelter continues to fight for a home for joanne and her family joanne is just one voice amongst thousands of similar stories but her terrible experience emphasises the importance and clear need for support services and housing help for those like her with appropriate and sensitive assistance from the council and other agencies the additional trauma of homelessness can at least be more successfully handled if not avoided altogether ben jackson is director of external affairs at shelter to order shelters fully updated new edition of relationship breakdown and

declining fertility rates are now a dominant feature of the demographic landscape of western europe the uks current rate is the lowest on record but at children per woman it has yet to reach the depths seen in southern europe where the rate in some countries has fallen to less than denmark is one of the few countries to have bucked this downward trend twenty years ago its fertility rate was below the european average todays rate of is among the highest in the eu only france and ireland are higher why has denmark been different part of the answer lies with public policy demographers like to remind us that there is no simple relationship between a countrys rate of fertility and its level of publicly funded family support but it is also widely acknowledged that an individuals decision to have a child is influenced at least in part by perceptions about the likely impact of becoming a parent surveys show that europeans want on average more than two children per family but it seems other factors including the difficulties of combining work and family life stop them the danes began making a connection between falling birthrates and levels of support for families as early as the s amid concern about declining fertility rates at a time when more women were taking up employment a law was passed almost unanimously by parliament in to substantially increase public funding for childcare as a consequence one calculation that no danish expectant parent has to make is whether they will be able to find or afford good quality childcare for almost years all children over the age of six months have been guaranteed a place in a publiclyfunded childcare facility more than half of children under the age of three have some experience of childcare and for those over three it is nearuniversal almost of to yearolds and of to yearolds attend some sort of facility in britain on the other hand there is only one childcare place for every five children under the age of eight despite a substantial increase in investment in early years services by the government we still have pitifully low levels of provision affordable childcare for children under three is particularly limited and outofschool services for older children are scarce there are estimated to be fewer than outofschool clubs for the million young people aged between and parents often have to piece together formal and informal childcare arrangements to enable them to work britain is only just waking up to the potential of integrating early years and afterschool provision with mainstream education services in denmark childcare provision is now so well integrated with school services that it is generally assumed that once the school day is over most children will visit their local childcare service since the school day ends at lunchtime for children under the age of childcare forms a large part of a childs early experience childcare services are not only available all day but also all year round without halfterm or summer breaks they are also stable and longterm for many years denmark has had ageintegrated provision it is normal for services to cater for children aged between three and consequently children and their parents have a longterm relationship with their local childcare centre a relationship that is just as significant as that with the local school by comparison most british parents can only dream of wraparound care that caters for all of their children all day in the same place by the end of all three and fouryearolds will have access to publicly funded nursery education but this comprises just twoandahalf hours per day working parents have to find alternative arrangements for the rest of the day most childcare services remain in the forprofit sector and many services struggle to remain open as the majority of the cost of providing good quality childcare has to be met by parents denmark like many other european countries has taken the view that early childhood services are a social responsibility in comparison to the of gdp that the uk spends on early childhood care and education denmark spends and affordability has been an important prerequisite danish federal law prohibits local authorities from charging parents more than of the cost of a place parents pay according to their income the type of childcare place and the number of children they have broadly speaking what danish parents typically pay for one months childcare british parents typically fork out each week for denmark the benefits of universal quality childcare services not only lie in a turnaround in fertility rates the child poverty rate in denmark is about one quarter of that of the uk and falling while in the uk we may balk at the idea of replicating the scandinavian model of the welfare state wholesale we nevertheless share many of the same objectives increasing employment opportunities eradicating child poverty and enhancing early child development childcare services have now become so much a part of everyday life in denmark that no political party would dare tamper with them in the runup to the next election politicians would do well to take a look at

fostered children in more than half of the local authorities in england are expected to live on less than the recommended minimum allowances according to a new survey allowances provided by of councils start at around per week for babies well below the minimum rate of recommended by the fostering network the fostering charity which commissioned the research said thousands of children were facing a postcode lottery when they went into foster care of the local authorities in england which responded to the survey said they were paying the recommended minimum allowances or above the results showed wide regional variations with just of london authorities paying below the minimum rates compared with in the east midlands there is currently no mandatory minimum allowance rate for foster carers set by the government minimum rates for fostering children at various ages are published annually by the fostering network based on its own research on necessary expenses incurred the charity said it was disappointed that the governments childrens green paper published last week did not include measures to ensure that all foster carers received adequate allowances fostering networks policy and campaigns manager vicki swain said fostered children are being let down by a system which values them differently depending on where they live while the government is effectively relying on foster carers who are largely unpaid to subsidise the state the green paper provided the ideal opportunity to tackle the issue of allowances once and for all but sadly there has been no move by the government to take responsibility for some of our most vulnerable children a national system of allowances and proper funding for local authorities are desperately needed the percentages of local authorities paying below recommended minimum rates in each region are as follows london northeast yorks and humberside northwest west midlands east midlands eastern southeast

stickler the councils early years manager says there was not much of a tradition of day care the switch in political control in enfield from labour to tory last year seems to have made no difference the council is keen to expand child care provided there are extra grants from whitehall to pay for it labour so far has put most of the extra money towards child care in the poorest areas in enfield the most dramatic expansion is visible in the poorest ward edmonton green which we have reported on before there a generously funded sure start scheme began last year which is aimed at poor often single mothers to help them give their children a better start in life identified by health visitors even before children are born the parents are offered language classes self help groups schemes to cut smoking and avoid depression and recently sessions of child care only residents of the designated ward are eligible but the sure start formula is now being extended to the adjacent ward of angel road which also scores high on the deprivation index there raynham school one of two enfield primary schools offering extended care to preschoolers may become a childrens centre this is the latest government initiative the idea is to link care with childrens health services in the same place enfield is bidding to establish half a dozen childrens centres in the poorer parts of the borough as ever the funding arrangements are a mix of earmarked whitehall grants to which the borough is meant to contribute its an exciting time for child care said the assistant education director ann pennell things are coming together enfield is near the target of offering parents of children aged three to four free access to daily hour sessions of nursery education usually in schools about of this age group is now enrolled but ms pennell pointed out that enfield was below target on care for preschool children in the latest quarter about new places became available well short of an official target of progress has again been most impressive in poorer areas its there that the borough can recoup costs through the schemes initiated by the department for education and skills and restricted to the poorest wards gaps are most obvious in care for babies and slightly older children problems at the criminal records bureau delayed registration of childminders who still represent the first port of call for mothers wanting to return to work after having a child lines of responsibility for child care are not straightforward in the more affluent parts of enfield there are just a small number of private nurseries still ms stickler is confident about progress in care for older children in recent months she says enfields schools have shown more enthusiasm about providing care before and after school hours perhaps they see a connection between care and their exam results enfield like many other parts of the country does face constraints in provision in search of a better salary ms rose for

choosing to have children is one of the most expensive financial decisions you are likely to make estimates of how much it costs to bring up a child in the first years range from for just one youngster to over for a typical family with two children and thats just for the basics feeding clothing and keeping a child entertained add the cost of childcare and according to figures published by the national childcare charity daycare trust the total bill swells by an average or so per child a survey by norwich union suggests that a state education will up the total cost by about but this is peanuts compared with the it could cost to educate a child privately throughout their school years though parents who pay fees only for secondary education can get away with an average total bill of so its perhaps not surprising that according to a survey by birmingham midshires nearly per cent of people believe they would struggle to make ends meet if faced with an unplanned pregnancy birmingham midshires rather optimistically suggests that this must mean that the remaining per cent have planned for the possible arrival of children alternatively they havent twigged what a drastic effect children will have on their finances but it is not just the additional costs involved in raising children that take their toll it is also the drop in income faced by mothers who make full use of their rights to take time off work when a child is born or adopted how steep a fall in income mothers face depends largely on the generosity of an employers maternity package motherstobe who are lucky enough to work for an employer who offers full pay for the first six months of maternity leave will cope much better than those whose employer pays only the statutory minimum as most do this is per cent of earnings for the first six weeks of maternity leave followed by a week for the remaining weeks mothers who are entitled to take a further six months of additional maternity leave which broadly they can do if they have worked for an employer for at least weeks before the date the baby is due have to cope with no pay for the second half of maternity leave averaged out over a year a mother with a beforetax salary of a year would see her income after tax and national insurance fall by from to a month if she went back to work after six months at home if she took a year of maternity leave she would be worse off by a month a selfemployed mother with an equivalent level of taxable profits would see a sharper fall largely because selfemployed mothers and women who havent worked for an employer long enough to qualify for statutory maternity pay qualify only for maternity allowance of a week which doesnt give them the benefit of per cent of earnings for the first six weeks virginia

you have a new baby and at least a month if the addition to your family is over one year old youll get less if your household income is over but you should get at least some child tax credit if your household income is less than if you have a child under one or less than a year if your child is over one you may be entitled to some tax credit if your household income exceeds either of these limits

unearned income such as interest on savings claiming tax credits is not without its frustrations for claims in the tax year you have to give details of your income for the tax year why because this

overstretched parents are crying out for protection from the excessive demands of employers for overtime and weekend working that get in the way of a balanced family life the joseph rowntree foundation said yesterday after a fiveyear research programme it found that more than half of all fathers work more than hours a week including who routinely exceed the hour maximum set by the eu working time directive one in eight mothers also work more than hours a week including who regularly exceed the hour limit more than half the fathers and a third of the mothers work at least one saturday a month a quarter of mothers and nearly a third of fathers work on sundays although the long hours helped parents to achieve a better standard of living many were left struggling to balance work and family life shirley dex a professor at the university of londons institute of education and author of the report said the typical family now had earners one parent usually the father worked full time and the other usually the mother worked part time most couples have found ways to juggle their work and family life even if it means shift parenting and sacrificing time they could spend together so one or other can be at home with the children even so this research programme found a lot of tired parents a large amount of dissatisfaction and a desire to cut down working hours or even give up paid work altogether most mothers said they would work less or not at all if they could afford to do so prof dex said clearly the preferences expressed by many mothers runs counter to the direction of the governments welfare to work policies since they would prefer to do less not more work while their children are young despite the plethora of new legislation and policy on families and workthere are areas where the government needs to consider further intervention alongside its targets to eliminate child poverty statutory protection for workers not wanting weekend shifts or long

the british political landscape is about to be rocked by changes caused by the ageing of the baby boomers the generation that has persistently challenged conventional behaviour patterns the thinktank demos warns today those born in the uk between and into the postwar recovery number about million and make up nearly a third of the total they have been the first generation to grow up in a strong consumer society bombarded with advertising all their lives and led to expect the satisfaction of their needs another view of this group in general more affluent than the previous generation is that a significant number within it backed movements such as antiracism womens liberation and environmentalism were in the vanguard of the sexual revolution and had a disrespect for authority and conservative values it is assumed they will not respond as placidly as their parents and grandparents to being sidelined after retirement into possible poverty and a sense of powerlessness in the first detailed exploration of the age groups likely response to ageing demos says the government is risking a baby boomer backlash if it doesnt deal with the demands of a generation who plan to grow older very differently from their parents its report on the new old says the group can be expected to use its power at the ballot box to insist on quality and choice in public services the baby boomers are unlikely to accept the governments moves to nudge up the retirement age unless they are allowed greater flexibility in later life to readjust the work and life balance the baby boom generation has the potential to rewrite the political agenda demos says flashpoint issues may include euthanasia the rationing of genetic therapy transport green space pension rights protection from financial shocks and access to health and social care it is likely there will be calls for granny crches at work to help people juggle jobs and their care of older relatives demos calls for opportunities for elderpreneurs to fulfil lifelong ambitions to start up businesses or social enterprises including lowrisk equity release plans underwritten by the government in a list of challenges for policymakers the report also demands a rethink on all housing developments with the emphasis on making them elderenabled to break up grey ghettos and promote multigenerational living but the report is unable to answer a key question will the baby boomer pensioners use their voting strength to see to their own interests at the expense of their children and grandchildren or will they move into a new phase of radicalism pushing for wider social change demos says the defining character of the new old will depend on whether or not their individualism or social activism wins the day it identifies three directions in which they may go the selfish route individualists and consumer society pioneers will unite around the pursuit of fulfilment and enjoyment of their accumulated wealth with little regard for the needs of the less welloff the path of civic defender liberal activists will act as a civic bulwark against the erosion of the public realm which their individualism and consumerism helped unleash and create conditions for radical and progressive politics invisibility the fragmented generation will fail to coalesce or wield any collective influence but get absorbed into other currents of social change the report says the challenge for future governments will be to persuade the baby boomers to continue to embrace the radicalism that has made some of them leaders of social change at every stage of their lives preparation of the report was supported by age concern england its director general gordon lishman said a new generation of million older people are marching towards retirement with a clear set of demands the boomers are unlikely to put up and shut up he said if there was a failure to listen on priority issues political parties could be punished at the ballot box julia huber coauthor of the report said future governments will have to deal with the baby boom generation attempts to encourage people to continue working without offering something in return will lead to a backlash paul skidmore the other author said the welfare state could reach breaking point if the baby boomers use their political muscle to force governments to prioritise

despite the recent declaration from the minister for women and equality patricia hewitt that new labour had been wrong to promote the view that all women should get out and get jobs several government initiatives have been announced designed to help more unemployed lone parents go to college or work not surprisingly most focus on providing free childcare a major reason parents stay at home particularly young parents under is because they cannot afford the high cost of childcare according to government statistics of the teenage parents in england and wales only are in work or education while many may want to devote their time to bringing up their young children during those important early years others like yearold karla harvey wish to combine parenthood with studying and a parttime job harvey who has a twoyearold son taiylor is studying health and social care one day a week and works shifts in a care home for people with mental health and behavioural problems she says she is able to go to college and hold down a job that complements her studies only because she has access to free childcare harvey is one of teenage parents to receive free childcare under a project being piloted in four areas of england northeast lincolnshire blackpool and the london boroughs of barking and dagenham and greenwich all of which have high teenage pregnancy rates and low participation in education the teen parent project is run by the national childminding association ncma with funding from the department for education and skills dfes and the european social fund ncma employs a network coordinator in each area who sets up and supports a network of local childminders matches them with teenage parents who require free childcare and pays their fees for harvey who lives just outside grimsby lincolnshire her network childminder yvonne crofts has proved invaluable as well as looking after taiylor weekdays evenings and weekends depending on his mums shift pattern crofts who also looks after two other children often picks harvey up from work and takes them both home shes so flexible ive even phoned her two hours before i need to extend my shift and shes been fine victoria austin northeast lincolnshire network coordinator says before the teen parent project was set up months ago the only free childcare was a creche at the young mums unit for gcse or alevel students about people took up these places but as about teenagers a month continue with their pregnancies we know that there is a much greater need austin publicised the project on local radio at freshers fairs and by talking to local authority teenage pregnancy coordinators reintegration officers and the connexions service for to yearolds she has been contacted by young parents of whom have been matched with one of network childminders she has recruited gill haynes ncma chief executive says the mark of the projects success is continued funding from the dfes for a further months to cover the networks running costs the childminding fees however will be paid out of the new dfes childcare scheme care to learn which offers parents aged throughout england a year to cover childcare costs but this pot of funding is limited to education or training haynes hopes that connexions and local authority early years partnerships will earmark extra money to pay for the childcare costs of working teenage parents but in grimsby austin fully expects that clients wanting to start work will have to claim childcare tax credit and pay at least of the costs of childcare she argues however that the impact may be far from negative if their only option is lowpaid work but they decide to go back into education instead because free childcare is offered that must be a good thing harvey however says she will be devastated ill probably have to give up work and go to college full time even though i really enjoy my job and its good practical experience she says but she adds i suppose ill complete my

women working in traditionally wellpaid whitecollar occupations are earning less than half as much as their male counterparts the revelation suggests that despite government figures released last week showing that the gap between mens and womens pay closed slightly in the past year many industries continue to operate a glass ceiling for female staff the survey produced by the salary comparison site payfindercom and based on input from nearly users across the uk shows that the banking industry has the biggest pay gap with the average male workers salary almost per cent more than that of the average female employee a series of highprofile lawsuits in recent years launched by leading female bankers aggrieved that their male colleagues are earning more than them has resulted in a wave of multimillionpound payouts in the city the survey shows that in of britains biggest industries men earn at least per cent more than women even in what are seen as more femaleorientated industries there are yawning differences in salaries between the sexes in both sales and public relations men earn almost per cent more than women women in many other industries which have tried to shed their masculine image hardly fare any better in advertising the average male employee is paid almost a third more than the average woman while in law and accountancy the average gap is per cent and per cent respectively industries with the smallest salary gaps were centred around the charity and public service sectors only in the customer services industry which largely involves call centre work are women paid more than men per cent on average experts blame the gap on the way that many industries appear to prize what are seen as male strengths a report by the work foundation suggested that employers reward toughness competitiveness and aggressiveness qualities seen as masculine the foundations report also suggested that many industries networks important for making contacts and doing deals consist mainly of men and are dominated by their interests and cultures statistics released last week by the government showed that average hourly pay for women is per cent that of men compared with per cent in the previous months hourly pay rose by per cent among women while for men it increased by per cent according to new data from the office for national statistics trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt welcomed the findings describing them as encouraging news this shows that our policies to improve the choices and opportunities open to women in the labour market are setting the right framework for the pay gap to close we are tackling a range of barriers by providing access to childcare to flexible working arrangements and promoting womens participation in key areas where they are underrepresented however catherine jane wilson of payfinder said its clear from our data that theres a huge pay discrepancy across the board in many industries in this day and age its just

motherhood is under scrutiny and the pendulum swings back towards the fifties family complete with breadwinner father oxoadvert mum and children raised on beatrix potter and homemade soup half a century after women longed for a career and a life outside the home we are in a tupperware timewarp one survey claims that only one per cent of women want to work fulltime when their children are small and two thirds would prefer to give up even a parttime job another report by the national family and parenting institute says that mothers complain of being pushed towards work once nonworking mothers were supposedly ostracised at parties by men who implied they would rather be entertained by the ancient mariner than by chutneymaking bores subtly the emphasis has shifted the new schoolgate powerbrokers tend to be fulltime mothers churchills in classroom politics and stella mccartneys when costumes are needed for the christmas play briefcases a demented air and bags of kettle chips for the school fete provoke pity rather than envy among those who have renounced the workplace traditional mothers have two new patron saints the first is betsy duncan smith a few days ago bds was just a target in a row over how many christmas cards you have to autograph on a husbands behalf to qualify for a salary now she is practically the madonna of the pinks a friend from the school run writes of how betsys ancient station wagon is crammed with bicycles so that her children can get some healthy exercise after lessons if that does not inspire guilt in mothers whose offspring get playstation ii and takeaway pizza betsys friend has another challenge why she asks should people think answering the phone in an office counts as work but dismiss the contribution of someone who takes a call while cooking pasta for though i am all for multitasking i would rather talk business with a worker behind a desk than someone who is plucking a grouse while extracting polly pocket accessories from a washingmachine filter still the point is reasonable mrs duncan smith and nonearning mothers in general have been patronised too much and heeded too little hence the emergence of their second patron saint patricia hewitt an evangelist of working mothers is not a natural in this role the trade and industry secretary is perceived unfairly by somerightwingers as wackford squeers in pearls headlines quoting her view that the government had failed mothers who stay home caused perplexity not least in miss hewitts office did she really say that while conceding that nonearners feel undervalued she claimed afterwards that she had merely repeated her mantra of the past decade choice matters and while most women want to work they also need more time anyone hoping that her wish to value nonemployed mothers might translate into the cashinhand tory prescription of making personal allowances transferable will be disappointed she thinks justifiably that the government has already made progress through tax credits and by offering some tokenistic paternity leave plus six months maternity leave paid at a minimum of a week and six months unpaid obviously in the future well have to look at whether we can make that paid as well she told me last week women should not get their hopes up a years salaried time off to have a baby sounds like a wish not a priority in other ways miss hewitt has shifted radically she now acknowledges that that the governments emphasis on work was overdone and she is right maybe the chancellor a new father will increasingly concede that point as he experiences the desperation of all parents not to sacrifice childhood to ambition or financial need but errors of the past may already have contributed to demographic meltdown as miss hewitt mentioned in passing the population is in decline with a uk average of children being born per woman the lowest on record the real question is why motherhood itself is so undesirable although the number of women back at their jobs within a year of having a baby has risen from to per cent in years many seem unhappy others find the compromise too hard and never return we still have sparse childcare and the longest hours in europe michael portillo outbetsying mrs duncan smith has been demonstrating on television what its like to be a woman bringing up four children while working in asda and as a classroom assistant affluent women spared such juggling are also ambivalent they recognise that paid employment is more fun than ironing they think they have a better relationship with their children than they had with their own mothers the floury icons of the fifties and sixties and yet there is a pang of loss women who think as a tenet of faith that work is synonymous with freedom and progress cannot mourn on their own behalf so that qualm is twisted into guilt that they are harming their children it isnt true last summers bristol university study showed that children in paid childcare fared as well or better than those looked after at home by their mothers but childrearing is suddenly fraught with irrational fears fed by politicians and family fundamentalists once children were a prop of the economy as factory workers or inheritors of a trade later they were a lifestyle choice under the new mythology they are burdens costly to raise lethal to careers always at risk and poised on an artificial cusp between yob and victim parenthood is becoming less appealing just as children become more vital as the population ages and births dwindle they are an economic necessity again this is tricky for governments mr blair can hardly embark on a coercive haveababy drive even if he wished to nor can ministers imply that women may be more valuable as breeders than workers miss hewitts view that deferring having children for too long has created a baby gap between the families women want and the ones they get marks the limit of official theorising but there are practical remedies birth rates are plummeting from italy to bangladesh because women feel oppressed by motherhood denmark one of the few countries to raise its birthrate significantly spends per cent of gdp on early childhood care and education against per cent in the uk and treats mothers and fathers equally here by contrast women still get only per cent of mens pay taking time out to have a child affects mothers wages and pensions for the whole of an expanding working life miss hewitt is determined to stamp out that discrimination by legislation or through culture shift and she will have to the economy needs mothers rather badly and the government must treat them better hence the conciliatory mood music for those who stay home with their children and the promise of more flexibility for those who dont there has been progress but when promises exceed action it would be folly for the debate about mothers to degenerate into a bogus tribal war between quichebakers and dealbrokers both hold more power

one of the governments key strategies to eradicate poverty getting women into paid work by providing quality daycare for their children may not work because the money they earn is too little to boost the family income according to research the government has pledged to reduce child poverty a fifth of children in the uk live in a household where no one is in paid work researchers have carried out the first randomised trial of the key initiative the provision of quality flexible daycare in an attempt to get more women particularly lone parents and those in families on low incomes into jobs a social experiment was conducted at a new early years centre on a housing estate in hackney east london which offers highquality care to children under five education by qualified teachers is integrated with nursery care children can attend full or part time and the centre offers care outside normal hours to help working parents demand for places greatly outstrips supply hackneys education department agreed to allot at random all the places that were available for children aged between six months and three and a half years the trial team then invited the parents to take part in the study and followed them up for months to see whether the mother was in paid employment and whether the family income had improved and to assess the health of the mother and child altogether families agreed to take part the researchers also followed up families whose children had been refused a place they found that more of the mothers whose children were at the daycare centre were in paid work than the others and they were also working more hours but despite the trend towards more paid employment there was no evidence that intervention mothers those with children in daycare had a higher household income the papers authors tami toroyan a research fellow in the public health intervention research unit of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine and colleagues report in the british medical journal this may reflect the fact that wages are low for jobs for which mothers in hackney are eligible they write furthermore women who enter paid employment or who increase their hours of paid work may experience a reduction in their entitlement to welfare benefits such as housing benefit or working families tax credit the findings bear out other studies which have suggested that women do not always go back to work after having children just for the money longterm earning potential relief from child care or job satisfaction may be motivating factors the trial provides some support for government initiatives based on the belief that daycare provision can increase maternal employment say the authors however our results question the assumption implicit in many such initiatives that paid employment provides an immediate route out of poverty by increasing household income tackling low pay changing the benefit structure and reducing the costs of daycare to poor families may be equally important components,2003-10,one government key strategy eradicate poverty getting woman paid work providing quality daycare child may work money earn little boost family

one hundred years after the creation of the suffragette movement british women may have the vote but their salaries remain steadfastly below the amount earned by men for the same jobs a survey shows that the average british womans pay packet is less than twothirds that of the average british man the disparity is by far the widest in the european union and shatters claims that gender inequalities in britain are disappearing the survey based on statistics produced by eu member states shows that the average british woman is paid per cent that of the average man compared with an eu average of per cent and a us average of per cent for british women aged to the figure rises to per cent compared with an eu average of per cent for girls aged to the figure is per cent of boys earnings compared with an eu average of per cent andrew russell an analyst with datamonitor which produced the analysis attributes the pay gap to differences in mens and womens occupational choices the results are more to do with the jobs women take rather than any inherent discrimination he said women were drawn towards occupations such as social work nursing and teaching which traditionally in britain have low rates of pay compared with countries such as france sweden and the netherlands hopes that conditions will automatically improve may be overly optimistic looking back to similar data collected in shows nothing has really changed russell said julie mellor chair of the equal opportunities commission said the uks poor record in improving childcare facilities was largely to blame although women are gaining more educational qualifications than everthey are still concentrated in lowpaid parttime jobs such as cleaning caring and catering because these are the only jobs that fit around the limited childcare available we need a massive increase in childcare and more employers offering parttime work at all levels of the economy these figures reveal britains shameful record on womens pay research by the work foundation also suggests that the pay gap may be perpetuated because employers often rely on previous salary data as an indication of what to offer potential staff for women whose existing pay is likely to be much lower than a male counterpart salary history often keeps them lower down the pay scales datamonitors findings follow a report by the chartered institute of personnel and development which shows that the proportion of women working more than hours a week has risen from in to in in the past five years in addition womens average working week has increased by more than per cent since the average female employee now works almost hours a week threeandahalf hours more than five years ago a tale of two experiences in the marketplace the nurse bernadette murphy is a community staff nurse from sutton in london nursing is struggling to recruit people now because womens attitudes have changed so much when i started my training in women werent expected to go out and have a career today nearly all my friends work its not surprising that people dont want to come into a profession like nursing when there are so many other more glamorous and betterpaid careers out there it is possible to earn a quite a decent living from nursing but to do so you have to really strive to get up the career ladder and then that leaves you in a situation whereby you are no longer having that oneonone contact with the patients which is probably why you came into the profession in the first place you get stuck doing administration and mountains of paperwork i do get annoyed when i think of how much i get paid when you compare that to some jobs where there is next to no training needed if you look at labourers on building sites i think most of them are paid far better than nurses even though i had to spend three years training and have to keep updating my skills and taking exams every year the manager sonja owen is an asda store manager in st helens merseyside asda won a castle award in recognition of its efforts to promote equal pay and opportunity in the workplace part of the reason i was attracted to joining the asda group was their culture of treating staff really well when i joined in i had a son who was under months but rather than be put off by that as some companies might i think they were actually quite keen as they could see that i would be committed to them when i returned from maternity leave after having my second child i was able to job share with a colleague this meant i only had to work three days a week allowing me more time to spend with my children which was really important to me to do this required the company to pay two people for three days work pro rata effectively paying per cent of a managers wage they were able to marry me with another manager in the area who was also returning after having kids so between us we were able to manage the store while still making sure we were there for our families by job sharing

men accused of attacking and stalking their expartners will face restraining orders banning them from approaching their victims even if they are cleared in court under a crackdown to be announced this week the move marks a victory for womens groups which have long argued that too many women are put at risk by violent expartners threatening them even after they escape an abusive relationship two women a week are killed in britain by partners or expartners there will also be new safeguards for victims of assault or sex crimes to prevent suspects coming near them again but the move will trigger a major backlash from the growing mens rights movement with campaigners arguing that in the aftermath of failed relationships women will make false accusa tions of violence in the hope of keeping expartners away from the marital home and any children under the reforms to be outlined in a domestic violence bill this week judges will get discretionary powers to impose restraining orders on a suspect even if he has been acquitted of harassment if they have reason to think the alleged victim would be at risk they would need evidence to do so but could accept testimony not admissible in court for example from neighbours or a family doctor men who breach the orders setting out that they cannot go within a set distance of their victims home or workplace risk instant arrest just because somebody has not been convicted of harassment does not mean that a victim does not need protecting said a home office source restraining orders now only available where men are con victed of harassment will also be extended to other offences which could include assault and sexual assault however jim parton of families need fathers said his members thought the balance was tipping too far in womens favour i dont see the point of having a trial if at the end you are found innocent and still treated as guilty he said there is bound to be a little bit of mud that sticks i think this is overkill there are plenty of civil remedies if somebody is domestically violent or supposedly violent research however has increasingly identified stalking as a warning sign that a woman is at greater risk of a serious attempt on her life the metropolitan police which has reviewed cases where women were murdered by partners or former partners in an attempt to identify early warning signs that could be used to avert future tragedies found that common factors included having recently become pregnant and being stalked by an ex the bill which was promised in the queens speech last week is expected to be published this week before the christmas period which charities say is the worst time of year for reports of domestic violence because the stresses of the festive season put many families under

it seems like an overnight success story but for jonny wilkinson as for every other young person who shoots to stardom its actually the culmination of years of training and hard work playing rugby dominated his childhoodand there cheering him on every kick of the way were his parents phil and philippa no doubt the wilkinsons took their cue from their sons talent drive and determination but there is always a worry about how far to balance your hopes for your child against its inclinations how do you facilitate but not force your childs achievement what can you do when your son or daughter lists in one direction while you believe strongly that his or her best future lies somewhere else all parents have high hopes for their childrens future and these are all the higher when as research from the future foundation shows we view todays society as providing more opportunities than we had the research commissioned by the childrens mutual found that nearly of us believe our children have more options than we had and admit to having higher hopes for their offspring than their own parents did for them how does this translate to practical parenting encouragement makes good sense and it is common to instil in our children the belief that hard work good practice vision and creativity will reap rewards high expectations it is believed will breed high achievement in the long run what though counts as high achievement and are parents ambitions for their children consistent however heartfelt they may be the confidence parents try to give a child telling them that they can be anything they want instructing them to aim for an exciting future to follow their hearts desire and so on may be at odds with a more pragmatic message so they end up giving mixed counsel we may tell our children to make sure their university course is interesting and enriching but also stress that it must be useful and that it should lead to a job likewise young people are urged to take advantage of the proliferation of careers choices available while at the same time they are told to make sure there is a ladder they can climb dont pass up a good opportunity we advise but dont undersell yourself by settling for the first thing that comes along no wonder they are confused what is most disturbing about the new research is that it shows how a parents rigid or outmoded bid for a traditional career can increase a childs anxiety and even in the worst case scenario obscure his or her own vision and ambition take for example a son who wants to do something in design while the parents feel strongly that he should get himself a sensible job in computing the son may very well appear to stick to his convictions but his confidence and selfbelief have in reality already been worn down by his parents lack of support he tries to make his future in design but then when he meets his first hurdle he is filled with selfdoubt and regret it may only be a minor setback but in the light of his parents comments about what an unsuitable career choice it was in the first place it seems like a catastrophe in this case the parents have done the very last thing they wanted they have influenced their son but only in a negative way making a career choice today is far from easy and parents will not help by simply repeating the advice they once received much has changed in the employment market over the last generation and many parents may still be out of touch even if they appreciate the changes in their own field they have almost certainly failed to grasp them across the board good jobs require lengthy training but the training required often isnt clearly set out it is also increasingly clear that you are unlikely to be doing the same job at as you were at what todays future foundation findings reveal is that while many parents still want traditional careers for their children jobs such as medicine and law they have failed to realise that traditional ways of thinking and working arent necessarily safe a college or a course or a degree may once have been a ticket to a secure future but today increasing numbers of even highly qualified young people find it difficult to find good jobs in contrast many young people find good jobs in sectors in which they have no training but they pick things up quickly learn to adapt are imaginative and are stimulated and contented in their work there is no real paradox between valuing our childs choices and doing our best to secure our childs future but we must examine the ways in which our fears interfere with the wish to see our children fulfil their potential ask yourself how genuinely open you are to what your son or daughter wants to do and watch that you dont crush your childs tentative moves towards choosing a career with a comment that seems to you innocuous such as are you sure or what if these may set alarm bells ringing when you only wanted to sound a mild note of caution we have to learn to focus on a young persons own views and to challenge and dismantle our assumptions that we know our child and what they want as young people grow their needs and wishes change we have to be prepared to hear new things about their interests and hopes and we have to walk alongside them offering support ready to discuss alternative plans we have to keep up by keeping an open mind and be ready to reshape our expectations we need to understand that even as our children grow older they continue to be deeply influenced by our views and led by our expectations whatever they might say to the contrary if they think they are diverging from our hopes they may feel dazed and depressed by a sense of failure every parent knows a career choice is an important one and every parent wants to help with the process so there is an irony in the fact that we may be the very ones who trip our kids up few parents experience the reflected glory that the wilkinsons have but we can all do our best for our kids just by being willing to listen with an open mind as our offspring sift through the options before making that final crucial choice to order terri apters the myth of maturity what teenagers

your own experience i did this and it worked for me or in my day simply arent helpful dont be surprised if there is a sudden hitch or lull in your childs academic or career progress dont assume it spells disaster and dont add to the pressure which may in turn lead to depression by not being supportive take your cue from your child find out what they want and then try to help by giving ideas about how to go about it it may help your child to manage the uncertainty of the world of work to acknowledge that uncertainty yourself dont pretend you have all the answers talk with them about the fact that an element of uncertainty in todays environment is inevitable dont pressure your child to follow you into your chosen career however much you enjoy what you do and however much you think it would suit her just by enjoying your own job you will be making a case for its merits be totally honest about its pitfalls as well as its high points try to build options into your childs chosen field

polly stuart mops up the spilt milk with a stockinged foot and tries once again to persuade matt her twoyearold son to finish his tea children can make you happy but per cent of the time there are rows and per cent of the time its over the kids she sighs in the background her husband william moodily changes tv channels the argument they had the night before over childcare responsibilities clearly still smarts i thought having children would make me happy but im no happier than i was before im just happy in a different way says polly my delight in having a son is tempered by feelings of guilt anger fear and resentment a major new survey last week into parents attitudes towards their offspring came to a rather awkward conclusion it showed that far from children being little bundles of joy having them does not necessarily bring happiness instead according to the britons aged between and who were questioned adults are finding the courage to admit that parenthood is not all it is cracked up to be about one third of women and per cent of the men questioned in the lever faberg family report admitted that having children has not made them any happier a steady flow of surveys in the past few years has shown that torn between quality of life and success in the workplace adults are delaying parenthood sometimes forgoing it altogether but what has remained taboo however is the admission by those who do start a family that children are not a constant source of unadulterated delight the link between children and happiness has as a result remained relatively unexplored it is only now that we are getting whispers of the often equivocal relationship parents have with their children parents are becoming increasingly able to admit that children can erode as well as increase their quality of life despite all attempts to prepare for their impact by stockpiling wealth and precisionplanning their careers i find it incredible that i misjudged quite so badly how much having a child would cost despite building what i thought would be the perfect lifestyle financial position and relationship before giving birth said yearold emma flack a company executive in the city i never dreamt one child could be such an enormous financial drain but i cant help wondering how my husband and i can possibly sustain this new lifestyle where we have to count every penny such testimonies may be one factor in a clear shift in britains demographic makeup overs outnumber children for the first time as birth rates fall because of womens increasing reluctance to have children this latest survey will fuel the debate over why motherhood is becoming less attractive some experts point to mothers lack of earning power and the soaring cost of childcare fulltime female workers earn on average per cent less than the average hourly earnings of male counterparts in addition mothers tend to work in lowpaid parttime jobs and even fulltime working mothers are often paid less than women without children other observers believe it is simply the growing desire among women to have successful careers that is delaying or in some cases destroying plans to have children such is the ferocity of the debate that it is now firmly on the political agenda david willetts the shadow cabinets new head of policy coordination wants to use his roving brief to devise ideas attractive to young working mothers tax breaks for married couples the traditional tory message may now give way to other ways of helping women over the financial emotional and professional cost of taking time out to have children he argues that france has traditionally had similar birth rates to britains but that over the past decade britain has begun to lag behind because couples here take longer to get a foot on the property ladder and pay off the debts they incurred at university britain is one of the few advanced western countries with a fall in its birthrate in the past five years and that clearly correlates with the house price boom says willetts basically it just takes longer in a world where we have got student debt and houses are more expensive to create the nest within which you want to have children and so we are delaying childbearing although he has long argued that the falling birthrate has serious economic consequences such as a shrinking pool of workingage taxpayers able to provide the pot from which state benefits and pensions are paid willetts a father of four insists tories are not interested in trying to make women go back to the kitchen sink im not trying to force people to have children they dont want i am trying to make it a more familyfriendly world in which people can have children if they wish when faced with the reality of sacrificing a hardearned lifestyle women without children in their thirties are revealing an ever more cautious attitude to motherhood one third of women in their twenties without children now admit fearing the impact that a child will have on their career a fear that appears well founded when compared with the complaints of women who did choose to have children in their twenties per cent of whom cite missing out on their career or putting their working life on hold as a major regret but while such fears and complaints might once have been dismissed by their elders as the uninformed whim of those too young to know better a growing list of studies shows that the older they become the more todays young women question whether children are really worth having i began stockpiling my income in my twenties so that having children in my thirties wouldnt make such a dent in my income said marie matt a yearold pr manager but now im in my thirties i realise i would have to make far bigger lifestyle sacrifices than when i was younger and less successful she added im just not sure im prepared to do that yet matt is not alone in british mothers were on average aged years at the time of their first birth two and a half years older than in their mothers generation and as the choice to delay parenthood or remain childless altogether becomes more common society is quietly accepting the idea a survey two years ago by the world values survey found that people are increasingly looking past children for selffulfilment in response to the questions do you think that a woman has to have children in order to be fulfilled or is this not necessary fewer than per cent of british women and per cent of british men said yes when asked to identify what made them most happy parents in the faberg report cited sport friends and hobbies as often as they cited children in addition per cent of fathers said that work made them even more happy than their own offspring while no parents went as far to say they regretted having children they admitted to a feeling of resentment for the lifestyle and material affluence of friends who without children had time and money to socialise and travel men were made unhappy by the difficulties of parenting while women cited the negative impacts on their lifestyles such as putting career ambitions on hold those without children can see children as a threat to their lifestyles finances and relationships and therefore happiness said keith weeds the chairman of lever faberg but at the same time they often consider children a natural progression and an unfulfilled desire for a child can be allconsuming and lead to high levels of unhappiness instead of automatically choosing children as the path to happiness adults and women especially are increasingly determined to travel all the roads in between caroline harding a yearold director at a city firm has a very firm idea of how the route her life will take before she risks motherhood im very determined about the things i want to do before i have children because once you have kids thats it as far as independent living goes she said i want to spend more time with my partner i want to solidify my career i want enough money to hire a fulltime nanny so i can get back on the career ladder and i want to get a house suitable for children ready she added i estimate all that will take five years but its worth the wait

the children of mothers who return to work full time in the years before they start school have slower emotional development and score less well in reading and maths tests according to a study published today by the institute for social and economic research the disadvantage starts in primary school and persists into early adulthood with lower educational attainment higher unemployment and greater likelihood of childbearing early in life an early return to work by the mother reduces the childs chances of progressing to alevel from to the employment patterns of the father have little effect said the study by john ermisch and marco francesconi professors at essex university they found that in britain the adverse effect on children was the same whether mothers returned to work full time before the childs first birthday or before the age of five this ran counter to studies overseas suggesting that a return to work in the first year had more impact on the child they said the consequences were less severe for the children of bettereducated mothers and the positive effects of higher household income brought about by the mother returning to work went some way to compensate for the negative effect of reduced contact in the early years prof francesconi said last night even the children of highly educated mothers who go back to fulltime work early will have lower educational attainment but the disadvantage will not be as much as it is for less educated mums he said the findings came in part from studies comparing the outcomes for siblings looking at the relationship between educational attainment and the age at which the mother returned to fulltime work this confirmed that the negative effect of an early return could not be explained by differences between families the study was presented as the first largescale appraisal of international research on working mothers it said the longterm effects of maternal employment have their strongest manifestation in lower educational attainments for children in their late teens and early s much of the report looked at what happened to children in twoparent families but it was gloomy about the prospects for the children of lone parents with low educational qualifications being encouraged by the government to take lowincome jobs the national family and parenting institute said the iser report ran counter to a recent study of women from bristol university that showed the timing of a mothers return to work had no influence on their childrens development a spokeswoman said this debate has been rumbling on for a long time without getting anywhere findings like this have a massive effect on the selfesteem and levels of guilt experienced by working parents for many people the choices about working or not working are entirely financial particularly on the question about whether to work full time or part time other research shows parents would like to spend more time with their children often it is working practices particularly for men that prevent this we work the longest hours in europe and the institute is campaigning to change that there are undoubtedly many women who would prefer not to work or to work part time but those options are simply not there for them parents are increasingly finding creative ways to be with their children more such as shift

parents face a childcare postcode lottery with too few places and excessive costs because government help is targeted on the poorest areas a study published today warns a report by the daycare trust reveals that in some areas there is still only one registered childcare place for every seven children compared with one in five in other parts of the country the shortage comes despite government efforts to address the uks historically inadequate levels of childcare which fall well below provision in most other comparable countries according to the study facing the childcare challenge the policy of focusing services on families living in the most disadvantaged areas neglects the needs of poorer children living elsewhere the research says of children living in poverty do not live in the targeted zones but in poor neighbourhoods in otherwise betteroff areas the study examines child care provision in cornwall the london borough of greenwich middlesbrough and sefton merseyside none of which fall within areas given special childcare help while nationally there is now one registered childcare place to every five children under eight the proportion is one to seven in sefton and one to six in middlesbrough and cornwall parents interviewed for the report raised concerns over the shortage of places and the costs involved the average weekly cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two is in england as a whole rising to in inner london stephen burke director of the daycare trust said the childcare gap is beginning to close but this report highlights how the childcare

parents seeking childcare are trapped in a postcode lottery with seven children fighting for every nursery place in some parts of the country a new report reveals this week targeting subsidised places on the poorest neighbourhoods as the government has done so far has left parents struggling elsewhere the daycare trust concluded its survey of parents across england suggests a competition for nursery places now as intense as any battle to get into a desirable secondary school one middlesborough hospital worker said the waiting list for her work creche was now two years long so before you were even pregnant youd have to put your child on the list nursery places in inner london now cost nearly twice as much as the value of the tax credit for poorer parents which is meant to cover their childcare costs while on average there is one place for every five children under eight in england competition rose in one area studied sefton a relatively affluent part of merseyside to one place for every seven youngsters parents want childcare that does not discriminate against them because of where they live the report facing the childcare challenge concludes in order to reach all parents and children and in order for the government to meet its child poverty targets these services need to be rolled out beyond the per cent most disadvantaged areas which they have targeted so far childrens minister margaret hodge will give the first public signal this week that the government wants to make a childcare place for every family a cornerstone of the next election manifesto the vision must be to have high quality accessible and affordable childcare for every child who wants it said hodge who will address a conference on tuesday organised by the daycare trust she is also expected to stress

state while blairites believe an eyecatching pledge on early years could symbolise new labours willingness to break down class barriers and improve life chances the emerging theme of the manifesto

third age the challenge one of the biggest changes we have seen over the past years or so is the growth in life expectancy half a century ago if people reached the statutory retirement age they could expect on average only to live on a few more years now the despatch of th birthday cards has become a major industry at buckingham palace and with the presence of many more older pensioners there are big questions about the best way to ensure the dignity in old age which they deserve our party has robust policies which would make a big difference to them free personal care substantial age additions on the pension when people reach first then and the abolition of the council tax which has such a devastating impact on pensioners but today i want to look at the other side of whats been called the longevity bonus the needs and aspirations of active older people these are a fast expanding section of the population who have largely been neglected by successive governments while the other main opposition party has been preoccupied with its internal feuds we have started work on a series of new policy initiatives to help active older people the definition particularly covers those who are approaching or who have recently reached retirement age but it also includes many who are considerably older people who not only have a great deal more that they want to do with their own lives but who also have much more to contribute to society they are healthy they have many years of life ahead of them there is much more which could be done to help them make the most of their potential i know from my own parents how important active older people are to a local community they both went past the state retirement age long ago but they remain very involved in local activities in their part of the west highlands in particular by giving regular concerts to local groups somehow i find it very hard to accept the word elderly as an appropriate way of describing them theres now a new generation joining the ranks of the active old these are the babyboomers people born in will be reaching their sixtieth birthdays in two years time all the indications are that their aspirations for retirement will be much greater than those of previous generations their rock and roll years may be some way in the past but their rocking chair years are a long way in the future a recent survey by the think tank demos measured the extent to which babyboomer attitudes vary from those of pensioners in the past they are substantially more antiestablishment less conformist less deferential and more suspicious of authority they are not people who will sit back being grateful for what they have been given grey power is already becoming a force in british politics this generation is likely to push the grey movement far more to the fore we shall undoubtedly see redoubled efforts by all political parties to attract its support i cannot help noting that the demos study identified the babyboomers as more liberal and more internationalist than previous generations well need to revise the tired assumption that people automatically become more conservative as they grow older as i say the needs of active older people have not had the attention they deserve from government ive invited nick clegg one of our members of the european parliament to head a campaign team to consider what changes could be made to increase the opportunities available today i dont wish in any way to preempt the teams conclusions but i do want to spell out some of the issues which clearly need addressing first of all our party has felt for some time that it is wrong for there to be a fixed retirement age liberal democracy is all about extending choice give people the option to decide their retirement age and you immediately extend their freedom in a very significant way and you should not make it a straight choice between fulltime work and complete retirement many people want to scale back their working hours as they near the end of their careers but not necessarily to give up work altogether move too abruptly from a demanding work schedule to total retirement and you can all too easily experience a severe shock to the system and it can also often mean much waste of talent and experience theres a great deal therefore to be said for a flexible decade of retirement let people choose a retirement age to suit their individual circumstances at the same time the pension system needs to be more flexible its wrong to bar everybody whos still earning from drawing a part of their pension it should be possible to devise a scheme whereby people were able to draw a proportion of their pension entitlement while still working parttime one notable development has been the increase in selfemployment for the to age group in only one in twenty worked for themselves now it is one in eight and over half say that they would like to be selfemployed with scope to begin drawing a proportion of their pensions many more people in their sixties could fulfil this ambition whats needed is more encouragement from government there is much to be said for credit schemes specially designed for older entrepreneurs the charity age concern have a subsidiary called prime which gives advice and support to people over fifty who want to start their own businesses if this sort of help was more widely available coupled with access to credit it would do wonders for expanding the opportunities available to the over fifties theres another area where a great deal more could be done for the active old this is a generation which has come to put great value on education whether its for the acquisition of skills or for its own sake the recent national adult learning survey showed a great appetite for learning amongst this age group of those in the age group and in the group saw themselves as learners one of the key areas where theres a real desire to learn is in new technology evidence shows that older people may be reluctant at first to learn their way round computers but once theyve overcome their initial reservations theyre likely to use the skills which they have learnt much more than younger people with families often now living far apart from each other a grandparent who knows how to surf the web and use email is far less likely to feel cut off the ippr has proposed a specific learning entitlement for all those who have reached their th birthday it would be weighted particularly towards those who have not been to university the benefits for these learners in terms of wellbeing and independence in the decades ahead would be enormous learning online could well be part of the provision but there is great scope too for extending the role of schools so that they stay open after hours more and allow their facilities to be used by the community in particular by older learners the idea of an extended school is catching on fast one of the advantages is that it can break down the barriers between the young and the old the old can put their experience at the disposal of the young the young can demonstrate to the old that they are not the frightening alien force which they may originally have feared as a party weve said that everybody should be given the right to free tuition for five gcses and two alevels there should be no age barrier here many people who are retired or semiretired could enrich their lives enormously by gaining qualifications on which they missed out when they were younger beyond that there should be a further entitlement to free tuition at university for anyone who does not already have a degree and who qualifies for admission again regardless of age the challenge for politicians is to make these real choices and options for all older people not just those who are sufficiently wealthy and articulate to make their own dreams come true next theres the question of support services for the older generation all age groups in this country have problems with red tape the present government with its unerring instinct for trying to micromanage everything from whitehall has undoubtedly made life more difficult for everyone but older people tend to come up against the system more than most pension arrangements whether they are about to retire or have already retired are bound to be a big preoccupation they are also more likely to use the health service and to have to grapple with the benefits system thats why i am very strongly attracted to the idea of establishing a one stop shop to which older people can go within their community to get any advice or support which they need the government is already talking about establishing child centres of this kind it makes just as much sense to group services for older people under one roof often the focus could be a community group these organisations often know the needs of older people and understand how to meet those needs much better than the statutory authorities this government has introduced more and more meanstested benefits the pension credit is the latest and most complicated the budget set for it actually assumed that large numbers of those entitled to it wouldnt actually claim in my view that was a deeply shocking assumption to make but the one stop shop should do a great deal to encourage people entitled to benefits like this to take them up but with active older people the issue is not just how the community can best serve them it is also very much about how they can serve the community one of the concerns which many of them feel particularly strongly is over law and order there are already many ways in which they can make a contribution this group is the mainstay of neighbourhood watch schemes there is scope for developing these initiatives much further for those who have actually served in the police our party has put forward a proposal for retained police officers these would be fully trained police officers who would normally have reached retirement age they would be asked to undertake many of the desk jobs which younger officers are currently required to do freeing those officers to spend much more time on the beat retained police officers could also help to engage the police much more with their local community but older people can contribute to the community in many other ways too for a start they will be likely to be helping their own families with childcare for grandchildren but there is a great deal more that they do for society as a whole older people are the mainstays of almost every voluntary organisation as the pressures on those of working age become greater more and more is demanded of those who are fit and active and have more time on their hands the role of government in all of this is limited but there are some things which the state can do first of all it must remove any restrictions which might put people off volunteering openness and accountability are certainly important in any organisation but the bureaucracy imposed on charities is excessive and the penalties threatened against volunteers who fail to conform with the rules undoubtedly deter many from giving their time some of the best and most effective charities are the ones started over somebodys kitchen table they are effective because they are local and directed towards a very specific aim they tend to give maximum concentration to helping their chosen cause and minimum time to administration if theyre required to meet endless targets and business plans the people involved very understandably may just turn round one day and say thank you but i think ill go away and play golf instead at the same time there are positive efforts which government can make to identify local needs and skills gaps and match them to available older people there are already organisations like timebank which perform this role but there is much more which could be done if those in their fifties and sixties were freer to semiretire they would be that much more able to contribute their skills and time to voluntary work and there is great scope for them to work overseas too voluntary service overseas vso already runs programmes for older people theres an unlimited demand for the skills which they can offer it is simply a question of matching the right volunteers up with the right opportunities the pattern of life used to be twentyfortyten twenty years of education forty years of work ten years of retirement this is not a pattern which is appropriate to the twentyfirst century education cannot be simply for the first twenty years skills and knowledge need updating all the way through peoples working lives and beyond similarly work does not need to finish abruptly at age sixty or sixtyfive and the ten years of retirement has become a much longer period during which there is not only the right to being treated decently by society but also enormous scope for continuing to contribute to society its time that we as politicians stopped being ageist we need to change our attitudes to consider peoples abilities irrespective of age throughout history statesmen artists and scientists have had their greatest achievements late in life so the focus for the active old must be as much on opportunities as on problems nick cleggs campaign team will be working on the five areas which ive outlined this afternoon flexible retirement learning advice and support law and order and community service there is much scope for new policy in all of these fields and i am confident that the liberal democrats will be in the forefront of those who are seeking to develop that policy in an imaginative way a way which increases the freedom available to all

less happy in their jobs than women only of men now see their jobs as a career compared to ten years ago many men feel they are stuck on a career conveyor belt and envy the work flexibility of some women the possibility of working parttime or taking a careerbreak they too want more time with their children these findings are backed by a recent pregnancyampbirth magazine survey it reveals around a third of fatherstobe entertain the idea of becoming fulltime househusbands while a further third would like to switch to parttime work to spend more time with the children many parents face the choice of paying a small fortune in nanny or nursery fees or the mother taking a careerbreak to stay at home but what if couples could choose between who is left holding the baby thanks to the

centre for fatherhood wants there to be more equity between women and men in the workplacewith maternity leave women have the security of knowing they can go back to work after a fixed period he

been some steps towards redressing the balance legislation introduced in april allows fathers to take two weeks paid paternity leave they are entitled to a minimum of a week or of their average weekly earnings if this is less the leave can be taken from the date of birth or up to eights weeks from the birth matt pitcher of independent financial advisers towry law urges couples to sit down before the pregnancy and work out a budget of how much they expect to spend during the first few years of parenthood what exactly is your bottom line the minimum you will need to provide for a child he says

first the good news the next generation of children will have lifespans that will be on average fourandahalf years longer than those for babies born last year newly revised predictions from the governments actuary department gad reveal that the life expectancy for men who will be born in has risen to years compared with years for those born in for women the figure jumps to years compared with years for those born last year and now the bad news the figures are around one and a half years higher than the gad had assumed as recently as its last report in and will fuel further fears about the ability of future governments to cope with the profound problems associated with an ageing population the gad report noted the projected total population of the uk at is about million per cent higher than in the previous based projections this is mainly a result of a higher assumption of future life expectancy which leads to around per cent fewer deaths in the period to than in the previous projections improved diets better working and living conditions and better health care are all contributing to increased lifeexpectancy rates in the developed world the news of the revised predictions is likely to prompt fresh worries about the ability of the government to gauge the true nature of the demographic timebomb rhian beynon spokeswoman for age concern said an ageing population is either a challenge or an opportunity we think the fact that people are living longer is great but it needs planning for a start we need a more coherent pensions strategy that encourages people to save at the moment we dont believe this is happening and these new figures underline the urgency of that problem with people living longer the balance between those working and in retirement is set to shift dramatically in the years ahead according to the gad last year there were people of working age for everyone of pensionable age by this will have fallen to just people the governments actuaries estimate that in just under years time more than million people will be classified as being of pensionable age compared with just under million now by the number of pensioners in the uk is predicted to exceed the number of children for the first time david willets shadow secretary for work and pensions recently issued a pamphlet warning that british people save less than french and germans and calling for innovative solutions to counter the problem such as making people work more encouraging couples to have more babies and letting in more immigrants beynon said weve got to take into account

when joseph rowntree set down his memorandum in explaining why he had set up uniquely at the time a noncharitable trust to further social reform he made hardheaded points about what he called the charity of emotion the charity which takes the place of justice here was a man who did more practical good than almost any of his british contemporaries but he never believed in soup kitchens sticking plaster and shroudwaving tactics to tap the kindhearted publics purse what he wanted was to tackle the underlying causes of poverty and injustice campaigning for change in the law which was banned for charities in his day hence his noncharitable reform trust which paid and still pays tax in return for the freedom to support the boldest campaigners had womens aid been around in you can be sure they would have got a grant the charity of emotion has a place in womens aid work helping to galvanise volunteers and meet the cost of refuges which take in threatened women and children but the eyes of the group are on a future where it is victims rather than abusers who can stay safely in the family home a visit to the groups headquarters leaves no doubt that fighting for change is the core you are not there long before damning figures ring round your head street violence about which we make so much fuss accounts for of violent crime domestic violence for a quarter mental cruelty in a relationship is hard to tackle but who can equivocate about punches kicks and worse it is a question nicola harwin the director of womens aid has been asking for years since a meeting in a bristol basement of a group of victims determined to get something done there was nothing in those days she says it was a time when police talked dismissively about just a domestic victims and survivors had no voice whatever a long hard road followed past milestones like jo richardsons private members bill the first government legislation and as recently as the first home office circular to chief constables advising that domestic violence should be treated as a crime but the journey has been marked by other milestones such as womens aids publication not worth the paper which took apart years of the domestic violence act campaigners still besiege bastions of the law where nicola says judges still believe that an englishmans home is his castle they still have to press for joinedup thinking in the agencies involved with victims of violence at home passion attitudes are changing and the pending bill on domestic violence takes practical measures further than ever but the passion for reform is needed as much as ever along with the money to make it work as nicola talks the phones go nonstop at the national womens helpline manned by volunteers and staff such as sue who want to put something back in gratitude for what womens aid did for them sue remembers when her husband brought her tea on a tray in bed not to drink but to throw at her and their small daughter her friend shell took eight years to rebuild her confidence after the betrayal of a partner who beat her up almost as bad as those memories is recalling trying to contact the helpline and finding it repeatedly engaged three weeks ago the service was enlarged with the help of comic relief but the funding shortfall is still chronic sue shell and the others deal with victims of every income and age calmly directing them towards help with the authority of women who have been there too they have helped the partner of a police domestic violence officer an yearold who got in touch through the internet and women and their partners speaking to them simultaneously using different extensions and trying to keep violence at bay back in her office nicola returns to the reform agenda and gives a take on the womens aid version of the days of christmas a national framework to tackle the issue stronger legislation to protect victims safe child contact arrangements after separation equal treatment for all victims regardless of gender and including those with insecure immigration status powerful government media campaigns on domestic abuse education and information for the young a legal system which relocates

parents may be given statutory rights to take time off work to tend to their children including those in their teens under a review of the governments family friendly policies one provision could be time off at the point when children start school when they are facing exams and during the sometimes difficult move to secondary school the stage at which many boys tend to fall behind academically the proposals are being championed by downing street and patricia hewitt the industry secretary as part of a mediumterm review of the relationship between parents children work and home life ministers have also said they would like to see fathers being offered greater opportunity to take unpaid time off work perhaps after women have returned to work probably six months after a birth employers would be required to keep the job open for the father but neither the state nor company would necessarily be required to pay the father in sweden and norway generous extended paid parental leave is available for families not just given to the mothers part of the family entitlement is reserved for fathers if they do not take it up the family loses that portion of the leave according to labour takeup by fathers is high amounting to in sweden and in norway in denmark all parents are entitled to a maximum of weeks parental leave paid at a flat rate at present under contentious legislation that only came into force in april fathers in britain are entitled to two weeks paid parental leave mothers are entitled to six months maternity leave and a further six months of unpaid leave the idea of extending parental leave beyond the first year of birth is fleshed out in labours big conversation document the paper argues we will need an increasingly fluid idea of work that spans a longer period but is punctuated by opportunities to learn and reskill and to care for children and older people it adds if the governments light touch approach for parents with young children proves effective there is a strong case for extending it to parents with older children the government has already said it will not make further changes to its parental leave regulations until the completion of a review three years after the introduction of the present crop of rights in practice this means the government cannot legislate until at the earliest under the uks statutory paternity pay parents are entitled to a minimum of a week or of their average weekly earnings if this is less for a period of two weeks they can also ask for flexible working arrangements if their children are under the age of six the confederation of british industry appeared horrified at the prospect of the government trailing further legislation on this subject john cridland the cbis deputy director general said major new parental leave arrangements came into force in april this year business is punchdrunk with regulation any extension would be distinctly premature employers claim it is difficult to find temporary qualified staff to fill vacancies created by young mothers hilary campion a partner at the employment advisers eversheds said i will be surprised if these proposals will be taken up unless there is an offer of money four years ago the government passed regulations that allowed either parent to take up to weeks unpaid leave so long as the child was under five there has been very little

the government today mooted the introduction of six months paternity leave for new fathers although it would be unpaid and not take effect before at the earliest patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary raised the idea in an interview with the times today although she made no guarantees beyond suggesting that the issue would be discussed as part of labours big conversation and may form part of their next manifesto however the news has already been welcomed by fathers rights groups and condemned by business representatives ms hewitt said the move was being considered as a way to allow fathers to play a more active role in their childrens lives she told the times i want to look at how to take this whole package forward and six months off for fathers is one way of doing it although there may be other ways since april new fathers have been entitled to two weeks paid paternity leave new mothers can take six months paid time off work to care for their babies followed by six months unpaid leave if they choose both parents can also now ask for flexible working arrangements if their children are under six years of age however employers have the right to reject the request the government has agreed that these new arrangements will be given until to bed down no new policies would be introduced before then but time off for fathers is being looked at as part of a wider review jack osullivan cofounder of pressure group fathers direct urged ministers to make the new proposal law it would be a huge relief for a lot of women who want to go back to work but dont want to hand a sixmonthold baby over to a stranger this change would be a brilliant step forward and send a clear message that childcare is a shared activity between men and women and not simply womens work but the federation of small businesses condemned the proposal as a leave too far stephen alambritis the federations head of parliamentary affairs said for the of uk businesses that employ fewer than people this will be particularly difficult as every member of staff is a key worker its very difficult to get someone to just slot in for six months in a small business the confederation of british industrys

jennifer was taking her dog for a walk when she saw her former partner her palms began to sweat and she was rooted to the spot as she stared at him the violent man she had lived with who had been jailed for months for making threats to kill and harassment had been freed from prison early no one had thought to tell her i didnt even have my restraining order or my mobile phone in my handbag because i thought he was still in prison she says jennifer not her real name is softly spoken and in her mids she had been happily married until the death of her husband before she met her abusive partner the concept of domestic violence was alien to her i was standing absolutely still with my dog it was as if i was seeing things the sweat just came out of my hands i couldnt move it was like i was paralysed then he grins over at me she says she phoned the advance project and the trained advocate who had been working with her rang back and confirmed the man had got out of prison early jennifer had to get a neighbour to come to her flat as she was too frightened to be alone before he had been sentenced her expartner had been given bail for a month two days later he had appeared at her window brandishing a knife advance which provides hour crisis response support and advice to survivors of violence was set up in november in hammersmith and fulham west london as a pilot project it followed research which showed that only a small number of domestic violence cases ever got to court and even fewer led to successful prosecutions last year it had referrals and since april it has received the majority of the women have children more than of the women it works with eventually leave their partners and live safely advance aims to increase the safety of survivors of domestic violence and their children and to hold abusers accountable for their actions it has an innovative approach and has provided domestic violence awareness training for the entire hammersmith and fulham police force magistrates across london district judges sixth formers victim support volunteers and the boroughs housing department when the project discovered that it cost between and in legal costs to obtain an injunction by the traditional route it trained its advocates in diy injunctions the approach is paying dividends as they are seeing a higher success rate for women seeking protection through the courts the number of cases recorded as crimes has increased to and convictions have risen from to many clients cant see a future without violence and abuse and dont know where to begin advance helps them to plan a future for themselves and their children bear montique the manager of advance says there was one woman who had been stabbed with a knife straight into the top of the head she walked here another woman walked from paddington with a fractured skull so many women leave in the night and they arent even wearing shoes we had one woman call from a phone box and she was wearing just a tshirt she believes it is outrageous that two women a week die at the hands of a partner if two football fans a week were killed there would be an outcry domestic violence touches so many other areas money housing and immigration we deal so much clearing up other peoples messes advance has trained police to adapt a more formal approach to their handling of domestic violence incidents all officers carry cards which reminds them of practice at the scene protecting the victim and children taking photographs of the scene and a statement from the victim the victim is then handed a card with the telephone number of advance a domestic violence court was launched in the west london magistrates court in october last year it is the first in the country to hear all domestic violence cases from first hearings to trials with cases heard every thursday jennifer says the police were never away from her door the police werent that sympathetic as they thought i was mental i thought i wouldnt be believed he always said i was mad for jennifer the violence began after one evening in the pub when her partner accused her of looking at other men and became jealous and obsessive once she was sitting at home watching coronation street and he hit her across the facethe final straw was when he kicked all my teeth out and damaged me so that i needed to have a hysterectomy because i was haemorrhaging from down below which he had damaged with objects he wouldnt let her see her daughter or grandchildren he told the neighbours she was mentally ill and convinced her they had turned against her now i realise that he was evil he stopped me going to church because he claimed i was having an affair with the priest i became too scared to go out of the house and i was living on baked beans which were brought by people from the church one christmas morning when it was pouring with rain she fled with her dog i sat on a park bench in the rain and i was petrified of going home she says she says when she watched the domestic violence storyline in eastenders she had terrible flashbacks she also suffers flashbacks if she smells alcohol as it reminds her of her former partner jennifer has severe post traumatic stress disorder i will be on medication for the rest of my life she says i am not the same person people used to say i had lovely teeth but now they have all gone he took a knife to my face and i have got scars from the burns on my back she refuses to move from her flat why should she it is her home i refuse to be a prisoner she adds i threw everything out of my flat that reminded me of him i feel very strongly that if women are experiencing domestic violence that they should tell their gp she adds even if they cant say it just pass them a note jennifer is now able to leave her flat and relishes her new freedom the turning point came when she travelled by tube to covent garden and sat with a coffee watching the world go by she sent a postcard to advance because she felt free i do not think i would have been here if it had not been for bear and advance she adds i would certainly not have been able to go to court and i would have been in a graveyard the facts fewer than of violent attacks in the home are reported to the police two women a week are killed by a male partner or former partner nearly half of all murder victims are

britains first safe house for battered men is to open in secret over the new year the refuge in southwest england will shelter men and their children who have been physically or emotionally abused by a female partner a second centre will open early next year in northwest england and organisers plan to create a national network eventually the revelation of the refuges is likely to reignite the debate over the true picture of domestic abuse which mens support groups say is far more complex than is often portrayed in the media according to the most recent british crime survey for per cent of men and an equal proportion of women said they had been assaulted by a current or former partner in the previous year in those incidents involving injury just under per cent of women were hurt and per cent of men the survey found that per cent of women and per cent of men aged between and said they had been physically assaulted by a partner at some time mens rights groups argue however that the male figure could be even higher because men are reluctant to admit being victims they say at least one in every six incidents of domestic violence around per cent are committed by women on men at the last count there were shelters for women in britain that means there should be at least refuges for men yet up until now there was none said david hughes editor of male view magazine which represents the views of the charity mankind initiative hughes hoped the shelter idea would take off once the first centre has opened and its proved useful others are bound to follow were trying to get financing to have a refuge in each region hughes said ian hancock the nhs director of psychological services in dumfries and galloway and an expert on domestic abuse said its difficult for anybody if theyre being battered but with men their problem is compounded by the fact that they feel they shouldnt allow themselves to be battered by a woman the idea that it makes you some kind of weakling means its a double whammy for men it affects their selfesteem hancock said many myths attached to the issue needed to be dismantled hancock said people have this image of muscular women and weedy men but size has got nothing to do with it a man can be twice the size of his female partner and still be battered by her the crime survey acknowledged that a significant number of men believe the government is failing to take the issue of domestic abuse against them seriously male victims of domestic violence are particularly unhappy about the level of support offered by agencies especially by the police it noted it may be that support agencies have a particular problem in recognising that male victims can be just as in need of support and advice as female victims steve fitzgerald who helped set up the new shelter in the southwest said this is a major breakthrough women are just as likely to commit violence in the home as men for too long there has been this gender apartheid which has meant this important issue has been ignored the new refuge which is already sheltering two battered men has a family bedroom a living room access to a bathroom and kitchen and is staffed by volunteers it was welcomed by david smith who has three small children ive been emotionally abused by my wife since i married her over six years ago people see her in public and think shes wonderful but they dont see the private side to her he said i didnt see her angry temper until we were married its awful she loses her temper a lot and uses foul language in front of the children you cant stop her once shes started ive asked her to go for counselling but she wont i have to leave the house and take the children with me sometimes she hits me but im a lot stronger than her im trained in martial arts so its not a problem physically were still living together but im losing hope while the shelters focus is on helping men its founders stress the help it can give to child victims of domestic abuse sixtyfour per cent of child abuse is committed by mothers hughes said nicola harwin director of the charity womens aid disputed some of the claims made about abuse of men and called for more work on the way the figures are collected her group doesnt condone domestic violence against anybody but the majority of research is quite clear in an overwhelming number of cases domestic violence in the home is committed by men harwin said an increasing awareness of violence on men should not make people lose sight of the fact that womens refuges were underfunded the country needed one for every people in the uk but currently we have less than half we require she added,2003-12,britain first safe house battered men open secret new year refuge southwest england shelter men child physically emotionally

when people told marai larasi director of the nia project in hackney that her idea would not work she accused them of dangerous and excessive political correctness racist stereotyping and defeatism by launching britains first specialist service for turkish victims of domestic violence larasi was forcing the community to confront an issue it had traditionally denied everywhere we went for funding and support we were told this could not work said larasi we were told that turkish women wouldnt come forward that female oppression is normal in their culture and that it was such a closed and familydominated world that they would never seek help from outside there is no evidence of more domestic violence in this community than in others but there are difficulties in helping women to gain access to facilities compounded by the language barrier the success of the nia service in breaking down these barriers has however silenced such doubters two years ago fewer than per cent of women accessing the refuges and services offered by nia in east london were turkish today turkish women account for more than one third of contacts made with the charity they use almost one in three of the projects refuge places and take part in more than half of nias resettlement programmes the eyes of meral halkaci a driving force behind the project who has worked in the community for nine years mist over when she reels off these figures i made the decision to risk life and limb to go into this community and tell the women about the help available she said i was attacked and intimidated by the men but i kept on and it has finally worked women who spent their lives believing domestic violence was something they had to accept are finally realising they have a choice she said the impact of this project is amazing fatima a turkish kurd came to britain in with the husband she married at her husband much older was a political refugee who reacted to the stresses of immigration by becoming a violent abusive alcoholic alone and far from home fatima was stopped from exploring the wider community by her husband and prevented from learning english how could i guess women have the right to be free in this country when that wasnt the case in my homeland and i didnt speak english she said through an interpreter i only learnt i was a human being who could oppose what was happening when i finally escaped my husband before that i had no idea there was not a single day when my husband didnt humiliate and beat me but i stayed with him because i felt such shame when her husband tried to murder fatima with his thumb on her windpipe and his fingers round her neck she had to flee i stopped him killing me only by hitting him with my bag then i ran out of the house at am i never went back had it not been for nia i would have had no choice but to end up on the streets as a prostitute fatima said women from minority cultures who do find the courage to escape violent homes and approach the police frequently find the urgent help they need is the last thing they are offered they are often questioned at length about their immigration status before anything else said larasi the police often ask women why theyve come to complain at all because they believe such violence is normal in their culture the difficulty in providing services to minority ethnic groups is made worse when a group is actively involved in campaigning for a wider political issue such as kurdish turks people get scared to challenge bad behaviour from other cultures for fear of being called racist said larasi in attempting to avoid upsetting community leaders and being seen to do the right thing authorities here almost sanction bad behaviour the position of women and children invariably gets pushed to the bottom of the agenda when wider political issues become involved womens issues are perceived not only to be a distraction from the bigger issue but any women who speak out are regarded as hugely disloyal and can be punished through honour killings and other violent reprisals she added fatimas relief has acted as a buffer to the new reality of her life to walk away from a husband is difficult for any woman but it takes immense bravery for those from a patriarchal world to escape into an alien culture whose language they cannot speak most turkish women live in their communities selfcreated ghettos said halkaci theyre prevented from going out into the wider community by cultural control and language barriers its an incredibly effective mode of control and hugely dangerous to the women involved ayse still struggles to speak english despite moving to britain at my family didnt let me go to school after arriving here and stopped me learning english she said ayse eloped with an older man when her parents tried to force her into an arranged marriage soon after the family arrived in britain the hasty marriage proved a disaster but disowned by her family perihan and her small child had nowhere to go my five brothers and father were very oppressive to me the only girl in the family she said i was taught that british culture was something to fear so when my marriage broke up i was terrified and completely alone it was the nia project that gave ayse the legal advice and support that enabled her to find a home of her own for the first time i am independent and approaching

the uk population will increase more rapidly than previously expected and peak at more than million in according to forecasts yesterday from the government but almost all the growth will be among older people and the workingage population will start to decline within the next years leaving the country increasingly dependent on immigrants to maintain its economic vitality the projections based on higher estimates of life expectancy agreed by the four chief statisticians for england scotland wales and northern ireland were seized on by beverley hughes the home office minister as justification for a more welcoming approach to inward migration immigration is one part of ensuring the continued success of the uk economy and supporting an ageing population no modern economy can afford to be antiimmigration she said the uk population is predicted to increase by million to million in this is million more than an estimate last year which used preliminary information from the census the main reason for the change is a fresh assumption about future life expectancy adding months to previous estimates it is now forecast that life expectancy by will rise to years for men and years for women more tentatively the statisticians forecast that the uk population will continue to rise to million in before declining gradually to million in but this overall picture masks different patterns in the constituent countries of the uk the population of scotland is expected to decline continuously from million in to million in the numbers in wales and northern ireland are projected to peak in at million and million respectively implicit in these forecasts is a huge change in generational patterns the number of children under is projected to fall by from million in to just below million in it will then rise slowly until the late s when it looks likely to stabilise below million the number of people of working age is projected to rise by from million in to million in allowing for the planned change in womens state pension age from to between and the workingage population will increase further to million by and then start to fall unless more people stay in employment after the traditional retirement age the country will lose about million workers over the years to the number of people of state pensionable age is projected to increase by from million in to million in allowing for the change in womens state pension age the pensionable population will then rise more slowly reaching million by thereafter growth will accelerate and the number will reach million by eventually peaking at more than million in about years time these projections suggest a big change in the balance between generations in there were about more children than pensioners from pensioners will be in the majority and by they will exceed the number of children by about million ms hughes said these figures indicate that the uk population is not projected to increase indefinitely our policy of a regulated but flexible system of managed legal migration is right industries like the food processing and hospitality sectors who cannot recruit resident workers need migrants to fill vacancies whilst highly skilled migrants such as engineers and scientists bring new innovations and capital to the uk,2003-12,uk population increase rapidly previously expected peak million according

when michelle sholay and her two young daughters fled her crackusing partner to hide in a womens refuge in hackney it was pm and they took little more than the clothes on their backs but once the door closed behind them they could sleep soundly for the first time in many years he was using so many drugs it was time to get out he just lost the plot michelle says i had to just leave with what i had but that was the best sleep that me and the kids had ever had it was nice just to be at peace not to have the grief she was given a safe place to stay and more importantly a network of people to listen to and support her by the nia project which has been helping women escape domestic violence since it was set up as hackney womens aid in michelle didnt think she was an abused woman her partner of years had threatened her stolen some of her belongings and had even managed to get hold of a gun when she fled with the girls he went to her sisters house and kicked the door in but he had never hit her i believed you had to be beaten black and blue to be abused she says over time though she had been ground down and left frightened and depressed you start to doubt yourself and start to believe what hes saying i lost my identity along the way youre trying to please him and its look at you whos going to want you and youve constantly got this long face when she called the nia project at the suggestion of the police and told them she was scared about what would happen if her partner was given bail they offered her a place at one of their six refuges across hackney and haringey in northeast london by being in the refuge ive found the real me she says finding somewhere safe to stay for women who are in danger often with their children is a crucial part of what the nia project does nia is a swahili word which means purpose says marai narisi who runs the project from a tiny office in the heart of hackney nia also stands for networking information advocacy accommodation reflecting the fact that ms narisi and her colleagues do much more for women like michelle than take them away from their abusers at its dropin centre in dalston which was opened by sinad oconnor in the nia project offers legal advice to women who need help with divorce with taking out an injunction against an abusive partner and so on it hopes soon to be certificated so that the two solicitors it employs can take on cases for clients who are entitled to legal aid through outreach projects in the community nias staff and nine volunteers also counsel victims of abuse who are not ready to leave their partners or their homes its about not using matriarchal mother teresa approach women might come along several times until they make that decision to come into a refuge ms narisi says the nia project offers assistance to many women within their home area that can help to minimise the disruption domestic violence causes their lives by allowing women to be near their friends and family and letting their children stay in the same schools we work with women around their sense of safety ms narisi says a woman might have her abusive husband imprisoned for example but she doesnt feel safe going back into her property there is a strong sense solidarity here of women helping other women to survive their experiences and come through them stronger each resident in a refuge has a key worker who can give advice on housing legal issues and benefits having someone to listen to you is the most important thing says michelle who progressed to counselling other women once she had been in the refuge for a while and has since taken a counselling course she now works for another womens aid group after her months in the refuge michelle was helped find a flat for her and the two girls jacynta who is now helps regularly at the nia projects play schemes for the children of abused women she has blossomed so much from coming into the refuge its enriched her so much michelle says yes when she gets older theres going to be some questions but as long as im honest and i value her opinion well be fine most importantly she has been able to recover her selfesteem and still only look forward life goes on im not settling for second best and thats what its all about at the end of the day facts of fear of women who leave violent relationships fear that they or their children will be

the evidence is now conclusive women are turning their back on childbirth and marriage in unprecedented numbers as part of a radical redefinition of the female role in society against a backdrop of sweeping social change new figures reveal that around one in four women is now taking a conscious decision not to conceive preferring the freedom and career opportunities of a childfree life and those who do have children are opting for smaller families later the cultural shift has prompted alarm among demographers who warn that it has grave consequences for the future prosperity of the uk while relationship counsellors fear it will tear more and more couples apart according to predictions in the office of national statistics latest population trends report about per cent of women are now choosing not to have children compared with just nine per cent of women born half a century ago the figure confirms the acceleration of a trend towards childlessness in women that first emerged in the s but which politicians and economists had hoped by now would be in decline a lot of this is to do with relationship change said lynda clarke a demographer with the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine lshtm women are delaying marriage or partnerships and theyre delaying having their firstborn they have jobs and they dont want to lose their economic autonomy then they get to and say oops i forgot to have children often events conspire to stop women having children basically about to per cent of women start life thinking ill have children later but some just never get around to it said clarke perhaps they dont meet the right person or they meet someone who already has children from a previous relationship but profound societal changes also appear to have bolstered the trend to childlessness there used to be a real stigma attached to not having children but that has weakened said kaye wellings professor of sexual and reproductive health at lshtm weve become more tolerant of diversity more multicultural and increasingly tolerant of sexuality and many other things this is part of a bigger picture the increased confidence among women to reject societys mores was reflected last week with the publication of statistics showing that one women in four now marries a man younger than herself the toyboy phenomenon earned a few wry smiles and did wonders for the profile of joan collins but there is now evidence that womens empowerment is causing tension among couples if youd asked me about this seven years ago i would say the choice of whether to have children or not was a nonissue for couples but thats not the case now said denise knowles a relationship counsellor with relate invariably it comes down to women not wanting to have children and the man wanting them the problem usually surfaces when the couple hit their thirties and the man wants children to complete their lifestyle said knowles but this often means the woman giving up her career with per cent of children born in wedlock marriage continues to have a powerful role in governing fertility rates according to the population trends report the average british woman married at at the start of the s compared with just over today by the ons predicts the average woman in the uk will have her first child only a few months before she hits considerably later in the fertility cycle than that of her predecessors this may partially explain why almost a third of women in the s had three or four children whereas today the figure has shrunk to less than a quarter of that overall the rise in childlessness and the trend to smaller families means the average british couple of the next decade will have children compared with just over two years ago the figure is the lowest since records began and although it means the population is still growing by per cent a year economists say it raises profound concerns for the future statistics show that the population of scotland is already in decline and there are predictions that the rest of the british isles could go the same way later this week a report by the governments actuary department gad will paint a number of scenarios that will highlight just how devastating these trends could be depending on migration flows and life expectancy rates the uk population could peak in an event that would be damaging both symbolically and economically but even if the population doesnt decline as the prophets of doom predict few suggest it will grow anything like enough to combat the problems associated with an ageing population the last gad report concluded ominously at present there are people aged to in the uk for every person aged and over this elderly support ratio is likely to fall to between and by the middle of the century only a breeding frenzy over the next decade will avert this scenario but based on the latest evidence british women are just not interested as lynda clarke observes with reliable contraception you have to ask why people have children at all they involve considerable sacrifice and expense if the decision to have children were like any other rational economic choice we wouldnt do it but people are not rational worryingly for the governments of the future an expanding army of women might disagree i dont need to have a child to prove that im a woman denise orita of north london decided years ago not to have children she says as long as i can remember ive never wanted to have children people always said youll change your mind when you get older others thought that i must be gay people just dont believe you when you say i dont want to have a child but my views havent changed over the years there was never any pressure on me from my parents to have children only when i met my husband did i pay it a small consideration if you love somebody youve got to think about it but he was of the same view as me we thought about it for a while but then we said no it would completely change our lives im an actress and my husband is a classical musician in our line of work unless youre very lucky a kid would kill your career some women i know really want children from day one but i

a little known and little used childcare voucher scheme could be one of the most popular tax breaks for families by the end of the decade following the announcement by chancellor gordon brown this week that savings of up a week on childcare costs will be available from april the chancellor also announced increases in tax credits for lowincome families and an uprating in child benefit that amounted to a budget for children according to anti poverty campaigners and childrens charities mr brown who admitted he had a vested interest in promoting childcare since the birth of his son john said the cost of his package will be bn and would allow him to meet his targets for halving child poverty by the end of the decade childcare voucher schemes have been around for some time they have the benefit of being exempt from national insurance both for the employee and employers a range of specialist firms offer to run schemes for employers typically charging two thirds of the national insurance saving made by the employer takeup has remained low however as the benefits are deemed to be slim for both sides at present only one in employers helps working mothers with childcare either through workplace creches or through childcare vouchers from april the government says it expects families to gain from the scheme when it includes exemption for tax as well as national insurance mr brown hopes employers will offer to boost the salaries of parents with a voucher knowing it will bring a large saving on tax and ni to its staff experts predict employers are more likely to offer childcare vouchers as part of salarysacrifice package staff will approach their employer to start a scheme and agree to forgo a week of their salary the scheme means that working mothers on the rate of tax will receive the equivalent of an extra a week or a month in their pay cheques while basic tax payers will gain tax relief worth a week or a month employers will be able to offer places at local nurseries to their staff free from the current restrictions if they prefer at the moment the only tax exempt childcare is a workplace nursery run directly by the employer which few are prepared to fund however it doesnt need to be a nursery it could be any formal registered childcare or approved homechildcare contracted by the employer mr brown said employers will not be obliged to set up voucher or nursery schemes but are expected to come under intense pressure once the generous tax breaks are in place the confederation of british industry which represents big employers agreed with the federation of small businesses that offering staff incentives to stay at work with childcare subsidies was something all responsible employers would support who gets what after all the sums have been done any attempt to calculate who are the winners and losers from gordon browns benefits giveaway this week is almost certain to fail the interaction of the working tax credit child tax credit the child element of the child tax credit the childcare element of the working tax credit and an employees earnings is a complex equation beyond most welfare rights advisers let alone the general public we asked accountants pricewaterhousecoopers to have an initial stab at working out who are the biggest winners from the firms figures everybody gains a single parent earning who has two children under works less than hours a week and has of eligible childcare costs per week will gain from the rise in tax credits in april their income will already be benefiting from top ups worth and by april that will have risen to a significant gain but when the chancellor allows in april of childcare costs a week to be paid out of gross income and therefore be free of tax and national insurance it is less clear if they will gain under the childcare element of the working tax credit they are already having most of their childcare paid by the working tax credit and the tax gain from the new initiative looks like it will simply be traded off for against the tax credit benefits a couple with a joint income of who have two children and currently claim of tax credits will get an uplift in april of when the a week of childcare becomes tax free their benefits package rises to which is a gain over two years of assuming they also have more than of childcare costs a couple earning with two children and of childcare costs a week misses out on all but the family element of the child tax credit this has been frozen next year which means will bring a tax credit payment just as it did in but in april they will hit the jackpot any tax breaks are worth more to them because they are higher rate taxpayers suddenly they will be better off a gain of everyone with children will also see a small jump in their child benefit which is paid tax free to families with children regardless of income each currently gets a week next april it goes up to an increase of p a week however the single parent

gordon browns mayear package to encourage employers to help fund childcare won approval from charities and business yesterday as the government said it expected families to gain from the scheme under the measures bosses eager to retain working mothers can give them a week towards their childcare costs the payments would be free from tax and national insurance for employers the scheme which begins in april means that working mothers on the rate of tax will receive the equivalent of an extra a week or a month in their pay cheques while basic tax payers will gain tax relief worth a week or a month employers will benefit because they will not be required to pay national insurance on the contribution which is levied at a month the government which will spend m on the scheme in the first year and m the subsequent year expects that as many as families will gain from the measures generated by mr browns determination as he told the guardian earlier this week to put childcare at the centre of economic policy at present only one in employers helps working mothers with childcare either through workplace creches the costs of which are exempt from tax and national insurance or through childcare vouchers which are exempt from national insurance but taxed according to the treasury only working mothers receive the childcare vouchers in effect worth just for those on the higher tax rate at present or for basic tax payers and an extra have workplace nursery places while employers are under no compulsion to offer the new benefit ministers are convinced they will do so as a means of making themselves more attractive to the best employees and retaining women for whom the cost of childcare often means opting out of paid employment yesterday a spokesman from the cbi said we recognise that childcare is a huge issue in the uk and obviously help for companies where they want to provide it is a good thing the federation of small business said relaxing strict rules on workplace nurseries which currently insist employers run them would help small employers a spokesman said being able to support employees going to local nurseries or other childcare will enhance the community spirit many small businesses want to preserve the daycare trust predicted that millions of employees using registered childcare could benefit but it warned that the scheme needed to be simple for employers to implement to ensure that employees particularly in small companies benefited under the tax incentive scheme working mothers will gain as long as they place their children in nurseries which are regulated by ofsted or with registered child minders children cared for in their own homes will benefit if the carer is approved by the education department under the home child carers scheme which was set up in april but the tax break cannot be used to help pay relatives or nannies neither of whom are registered the daycare trust called mr brown the childrens champion and

the chancellors prebudget pledge to create extra childrens centres introduce tax relief on childcare costs and put an extra bn into child tax credits seemed to mark the final stage of his transition from iron chancellor to daddy brown but theres more to labours actions than the personal becoming political for gordon focusing on the early years is a politically astute move labour won in because women voted for them in equal numbers for the first time research also shows that what happens during the early years of a childs life can have a major impact on their later life chances and that getting things right during this period is the key to tackling later inequality and social injustice but will making early years support synonymous with childcare as the prebudget report did really be a vote winner recent polls have shown that women especially mothers are increasingly disillusioned with the government in part this is because many are crying out for better and more affordable childcare while major improvements have been made the number of formal childcare places for young children remains inadequate and prices are beyond the reach of many families however the government is in danger of forgetting that what many mothers want particularly when their children are under one is to stay at home with them one survey by the maternity alliance for example found that more than twothirds of women went back to work sooner than they wanted after the birth of a child this is something ministers such as patricia hewitt have already begun to recognise whats best for children during the early years is the subject of huge controversy evidence from the uk and the us seems to indicate a working mothers absence during the first year of a childs life can slightly damage some childrens performance in areas such as schoolage reading scores and behaviour this however may be offset by some of the benefits that work brings such as extra income there is interesting evidence though that how mothers feel about working during their childrens early years is a critical factor in determining the later effects on children in other words if a mother wants to and can work and this improves her sense of wellbeing and selfesteem it may be beneficial to her children however if she doesnt want to work or if she has to work long or inflexible hours this may pose a risk for child development especially when combined with poor quality childcare what all this suggests is that the governments early years strategy should be based on giving parents particularly mothers genuine choices about whether to work or stay at home during the first year of their childs life labour has already made important improvements to maternity pay and leave including reducing the period mothers have to work before qualifying for statutory maternity pay and lengthening the period of leave they can take it has also introduced paid paternity leave and unpaid parental leave for the first time however statutory maternity pay is still only six weeks at of average earnings followed by a flat rate of for weeks and weeks unpaid leave while employers can offer more generous provision only one in five mothers receive any extra paternity pay only gives fathers two weeks leave at a flat rate of per week or of their average earnings if this is less and parental leave remains entirely unpaid the result is that genuine choices are only available to those parents who can afford them evidence clearly shows that mothers in lowincome families return to work when the period of paid leave is over whereas betteroff mothers take much longer periods of leave it is fundamentally unfair that betteroff mothers can spend more time with their babies the uks system of parental leave must move toward a european model with betterpaid maternity leave followed by paid parental leave in some countries part of this leave is reserved for fathers to encourage them to take on greater roles our longhours culture and attitude towards working parents need to change too many parents who call our phone line feel their requests to work flexible hours after having a child are being unjustifiably refused giving employment tribunals the right to fully investigate these refusals would be an important first step in tackling the problem choice has become a favourite mantra of new labour giving parents greater choice during their childrens early years should therefore appeal to the government more importantly it may just be the key to giving children the best start in life liz kendall is the

gordon brown yesterday cheered antichild poverty campaigners with the announcement that families with children will receive an extra bn in benefits from next april the chancellor said the extra cash would ensure the government met its target of halving child poverty by and eradicate it in a generation more than m families would gain from the move he said lifting many of the m children affected further out of poverty nothing is more important to the future of our whole country than that with the best schooling services and financial support every child has the chance to develop their potential to the full he told mps under the proposals employers will be able to provide a week for approved childcare to every employee free of national insurance income tax and employer ni he announced an increase in child tax credits claimed by low paid families of a week families earning under will experience the full benefit of the a year boost from next april which pushes the child element of the child tax credit up to a year the benefit is withdrawn at a rate of p in the pound until it runs out at earnings of under a year mr brown also announced the creation of childrens centres over the next five years in april the government would hit the milestone of guaranteeing a nursery place for every three and fouryearold he said the childrens centres would provide support to parents of infants and allow young children mainly in deprived areas of the country to be introduced to early learning and books mr brown said childcare subsidies were a vital part of his strategy to end child poverty and signalled that he might widen the definition of childcarers to include grandparents and other carers for mothers and fathers struggling to balance work and family responsibilities help with childcare costs once available to only parents in is now available to almost but today it is time to begin to face up to a longstanding grievance that financial help for approved childcare be offered not just to some families but available right up the income scale to working families facing childcare costs so in advance of other decisions in the spending review i can announce as a first step that for every employee whatever their income level employers will be able as long as the offer is made to every employee to provide free of both employee national insur ance and income tax and free of employer national insurance a week for approved childcare he said the confederation of british industry said responsible employers would welcome plans to make it easier for them to provide childcare for staff a spokesman said this will improve the uks standing when compared with european rivals but we must make sure that the inland revenues interpretation does not render this help illusory campaigners said the chancellor was forced to act following figures from the institute for fiscal studies that revealed government plans to cut child poverty would fail without a further boost for low income families stephen burke director of the charity daycare trust said tax relief on a week childcare spending could benefit millions of employees using registered childcare paying for childcare is the number one issue for parents calling our helpline the cost is simply beyond the reach of many families the measures announced today will help more working parents pay for childcare the chancellor is living up to his reputation as the childcare champion but he warned the scheme needed to be simple for employers to implement if all employees were to benefit particularly those working in small and medium sized firms the daycare trust had lobbied for a more generous tax break for families who spend large amounts of their incomes on childcare a study by the charity last month revealed the average weekly cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two is in england as a whole rising to in inner london kate green director of the charity one parent families said

a big expansion in childcare for the very young including new tax incentives for employers to fund workforce childcare were signalled yesterday by the chancellor gordon brown in an interview with the guardian he also promised to extend help on childcare to beyond the very poorest a reflection of goverment concern that the welfare state is seen as relevant to middle class voters and not just a safety net of last resort the move comes as some blairite labour backbenchers worry that plans for topup tuition fees could damage the partys fortunes by punishing the middle class mr browns promise to put childcare at the centre of our economic policy comes ahead of tomorrows critical prebudget report in which the chancellor will give his annual assessment of the state of the economy and the governments longterm thinking the report is seen as a vital chance for the government to reenergise itself ahead of next years tight preelection spending round mr brown yesterday signalled in the guardian interview that significant sums of money can be expected over and above the bn which the government has committed to childrens services over a fouryear period there will be a threepronged initiative with the expansion of childcare centres changes to the child tax credit system and a big increase in the supply of affordable childcare the chancellor is responding to criticism that the government may fall short of its ambitious plans to expand childcare government figures show that one in four parents seeking childcare cannot find a place mps on the commons work and pensions committee recently claimed the childcare tax credit system aimed at working parents was too complex and too narrowly drawn with only of families making claims a treasury review due to report tomorrow has looked at extending the employer tax break to cover help provided outside the workplace at a registered child minder or nursery mr brown said yesterday employers will have to play their part too whichever way you look at it employers have got to be involved in this partnership he also admitted he has been worrying about the difficulty of extending the supply of childcare but is expected to announce help for a very large group of lower middle income families who feel that theres been nothing there for them in all the initiatives that weve taken in the past the chancellor admitted that having his own son had brought the issue of child poverty into sharper focus saying it may be mawkish to say that you want for every child what you want for your own child but i cant bear the idea that there are thousands of children this morning growing up denied opportunities that other people so clearly have ministers believe they have successfully targeted nursery education with all three and fouryearolds likely to be guaranteed a nursery place in a few months time but backed by mounting evidence on the causes of inequality mr brown is shifting his focus to even younger children the chancellor also wants to develop the child tax credit worth on average week though he boasts that some families are now better off as a result of measures the government has taken he believed more can be done weve got to do more to help people when they need it and help those who need it most in yesterdays guardian interview he brushed aside speculation about his relationship with tony blair but said he wants the public to be clearer about where the party is going ive always said that the great political parties exist for great public purposes and one of these purposes indeed i think central

government plans to allow courts to issue domestic violence injunctions against defendants who have been acquitted after a criminal trial are backed today by cherie booth qc the prime ministers wife says she was shocked by what i learnt was going on behind closed doors as a young barrister representing women assaulted by violent partners one client was murdered by her partner she reveals in an article for the guardians law pages ms booth describes the domestic violence crime and victims bill as a great step forward but says the uk could learn from experience in the us last month she visited a court in washington dc which has gone further than the measures outlined in the bill and integrated criminal and family cases involving allegations of domestic violence the domestic violence unit of the superior court in washington dc set up in has led to huge improvements in the way cases are handled she says the emphasis is on longterm safety and security of the victim not just pursuit of the trial process so the court also conducts posttrial monitoring into for instance the effectiveness of probation and restraining orders and other ways of trying to deal with domestic violence it has found for example that while the counselling and programmes for batterers did have an effect on the attitudes of firsttime offenders they had little impact on those with a record of such assaults what did succeed were victim treatment programmes indeed the evidence suggests the best way to prevent future domestic violence is to empower the victims the first integrated domestic violence court in the uk is soon to be set up as a pilot project in croydon south london tackling criminal and family cases the court set up with the help of the new yorkbased centre for court innovation will explore ways to increase the accountability of offenders housing and social services staff will attend court to try to provide practical solutions ms booth says she was shocked by the routine beatings bullying and attacks even on heavily pregnant women she encountered i quickly realised that this violence can take the form of emotional or psychological abuse as well as physical assault and that these threats and denigration may in certain cases be as harmful as actual violence i discovered too that this violence was not simply the result of drink or drugs nor was it confined to the poor or even to one sex

when the montgomeryshire family crisis centre decided that addressing the problem of domestic violence meant helping male abusers as well as their female victims the backlash came out of the blue we suddenly faced losing our funding and our reputation because back in society couldnt tolerate the idea of agencies working with the perpetrators of domestic violence says jackie richardson senior practitioner at the mfcc society has a very antiman attitude as far as domestic violence is concerned its one that we are determined to break the complaints abusive phone calls and threatening letters from opponents that came pouring in all still carefully logged and filed did not scare richardson or her small group of determined staff wed had enough of the stickingplaster solution to the problem of domestic violence she says it just didnt make sense assisting the partner of a violent man might help that specific woman but does nothing for any of the abusers future partners or their children the link between child victims and adult abusers has yet to be proved but richardson is adamant that any child exposed to violence in the home is disproportionately likely to go on to harm others the costs of domestic violence to society are so enormous and varied that helping to change the perpetrators themselves is the only realistic way forward she says in the end the mfccs innovative approach did not cost the group its funding on the contrary their determination and success over the past six years has won round the sceptics and critics the mfcc is one of the few domestic violence projects in britain to extend the hand of friendship to those who abuse and terrorise their partners and children last year the centre received calls from male abusers desperate to change their behaviour but with no idea how to begin it is now also beginning to see other agencies following in its wake receiving calls from other groups last year asking advice on how to advise the men approaching them for help abusers who contact the centre are assessed and after their partners have also agreed to work with the programme begin the week course according to shirley powell the senior coordinator of the project there are three sorts of male abuser those who hate what they do but cant stop those who relish the control and power and those who genuinely cant see that their behaviour is in any way reprehensible working with men who week after week refuse to admit responsibility for their crimes can be extremely hard she admits but then when they suddenly make a breakthrough and realise what theyve done wrong and how they can stop doing it working with the enemy suddenly becomes worthwhile as well as its perpetrator programme the mfcc offer a rich panoply of resources one of which has attracted almost as much controversy and criticism as their perpetrator programme alongside its counselling and advice service dropin centre hour helpline and crisis accommodation the centre offers male victims of domestic violence the same level of help and resources as female clients our programme to help male victims of domestic violence has been criticised for diverting the help and attention needed by the evergrowing number of female victims admits richardson but we believe society discriminates against men in the field of domestic violence they need just as much help as women to come to terms with domestic violence and rebuild their lives the lack of provision for male victims was highlighted by the british crime survey which found that the one in six victims of domestic violence who are men have minimal access to refuges in comparison women have more than refuges across the uk to which they can turn were not disagreeing with the fact that domestic violence is experienced by far more women than men but does that mean male victims deserve no help at all asks powell were not fighting for equal numbers of safe houses but one or two would be nice the mfcc is quietly of the opinion that there may be far more male victims of domestic violence than current statistics indicate again according to the british crime survey almost twothirds of women experiencing chronic domestic violence turn to someone for help and support fewer than onethird of men experiencing the same level of violence however had confided in anyone there are all sorts of ways men and boys experience domestic violence powell says it can happen at the hands of their fathers uncles or mothers as well as from both male and female partners to back up the theory that the problem is more virulent than maintained the mfcc points to the enquiries it has received from male victims in the past year alone while per cent of women know domestic violence is a crime four out of five male victims think it is just something that happens says powell there are all sorts of issues of masculinity tied up in this issue that were just beginning to unpick the third issue which the centre is highlighting is that male victims aged between and are routinely refused entrance to refuges boys are just as much victims as their mothers and sisters says richardson added to which this rule frequently leads to a woman not leaving an abusive situation because she cant take her son with her the montgomery centre is a lone beacon of hope in wales and is regularly receiving calls from both men and women as far away as scotland in the past year women and children have passed through its refuges per cent more of whom end up safely housed than the national average it helped almost women through dropin centres received calls to its helpline and almost hits on its website and all this on a budget of but they have big plans they want to set up a school programme to encourage children experiencing domestic violence to come forward they want to go into prisons and they hope to open a refuge for male victims we achieve what we already do through the tireless efforts of just paid staff six of whom receive only parttime salaries and volunteers says powell but theres so much more we want to do if only we can find the funding domestic violence in the uk although men and children are often victims the vast majority of attacks per cent are done by men to women one in four women has suffered domestic violence in her life about women one in suffered serious incidents in the last year surveyed of those women found safety in a refuge per cent of them were black or from ethnic minorities disabled women are twice as likely to suffer as ablebodied women older women are more likely

in most unequal contests the weak can outstrip the strong just as elizabeth is fleet vanquished the armada so hamilton academicals might someday crush real madrid domestic violence offers no surprise scorelines the annual tally of those who inflict death reads men women the two or three men who kill in an average week often claim they were unbearably provoked she ran off with her personal trainer they say or she didnt love me any more women fewer than two dozen every year who take a male partners life tell another story typically it begins with a chronicle of terror and oppression culminating in a snapping point below the level where family hatreds are resolved by vegetable knife or hammer there is an epidemic of lesser cruelty inflicted in eight out of cases by male aggressors obviously men get hit too they always have domestic violence stretches back to aeschylus and the plotlines like his deal with killers of both genders in todays version of the oresteia played out in hampstead and on sink estates violence produces paltry rates of detection and conviction finally a bill is published to protect the main sufferers innocent women and children it takes quite a leap of the imagination to portray this document as a harpies charter but some commentators have managed it the manhaters of government have in their view produced a skewed document that mocks the law historically the promen lobby is made up of rightwingers though liberals have also protested that female killers get sanctified as freedomfighters upholding the honour of their sex the bills most vocal critics are fundamentalists whose real worry is that the sacred family unit will crumble if women are allowed to escape their subordinate role how disingenuous of them to pretend that justice is at stake here except that they are right or partly so the domestic violence bill is mostly excellent in particular the new offence of familial homicide will stop parents jointly accused of murdering a child blaming one another to escape a murder conviction in one recent case the foster parents of a fouryearold boy found with adult bite marks on his battered corpse were sentenced to eight years for child cruelty after police said they could not prove who administered the fatal blow such vital reforms are marred by one confusion and two affronts the muddle is over the defence of provocation david blunkett and harriet harman who has succeeded in getting a neglected crime back on the political radar cannot agree he insists that it is vital because it benefits battered women she says a defence exploited by male killers must go neither is arguing the right case provocation rooted in sixteenthcentury notions of human frailty and the precept that men should defend their honour in hot blood is uncomfortably useful to women who kill many of those convicted of murder have had the charge cut to manslaughter on appeal claiming they were driven beyond endurance but men and occasionally women are now fending off murder convictions by citing behaviour so unprovoking as to imply that courts will soon be asked to excuse homicide on the grounds that the victim bought the wrong brand of yoghurt or failed to pair her partners socks jurors listen to feeble excuses because they do not like having to treat people driven to despair in the same way as psychopaths who slaughter strangers mr blunkett should attack the problem at its root and abolish the mandatory life sentence for murder if he will not he should at least adopt the solution preferred by vera baird mp the qc who defends half of all women who kill their partners bring in a dual system introducing a soupedup argument of selfdefence and retaining provocation fixed at a more reasonable level the bill has worse problems the first is the suggestion that men acquitted in a criminal trial may have a yellow card stayaway order imposed on them with the condition that those in breach could go to prison for five years such an assault on innocence is not only awesome it is also stupid anyone who reaches trial is likely already to be the subject of a county court restraining order imposing further controls on those cleared of criminal violence is a civil matter for family courts as the law society argues then there is the last big error in cases involving multiple offences such as downloading internet porn the bill wants a jury to decide a sample charge and a judge sitting alone to rule on the rest this is absurd if the facts are the same jurors have already reached a conclusion if they are different then excluding a jury sets a dangerous precedent in the words of a bar council spokesman a home office eager to keep the public out of the law is behaving like gollum nursing its ring the faults in the domestic violence bill mesh with a wider justice deficit the home secretary ignoring contempt laws effectively declares a terror suspect guilty judicial review on asylumseekers is threatened details of a new supreme court are unclear barmily the judges have chosen to fight the abolition of the lord chancellor an issue where the government is blameless there is no place for a juggler who sits in cabinet heads the judiciary and remains a serving judge while also being speaker of the lords the separation of powers between the executive the legislature and the judiciary is the spinal cord of democracy if the wigged branch of government has ceased to believe that then we really are in trouble the flaws of the domestic violence bill feed a general suspicion that justice is being tampered with in a sphere where women lose so much the temptation to twist proof and punishment is endless victims of violence as the fawcett society warned recently are also far more likely to end up in prison where the numbers of female inmates rose by per cent last year once there they are more likely to be mentally ill more likely to swell the toll of suicides women so far this year and more likely to see their children lost to them and their families torn apart men face a different agony bob geldof writing in mens health magazine describes the torture of a banished father sitting outside his old house fearing to knock on the door to say goodnight and watching his childrens bedroom lights extinguished one by one the law offers bad deals to good men that does not excuse it giving good deals to bad ones and yet some people though not geldof squash the arguments together as if male grief somehow justifies female victims being beaten others think it is justified to bend the rules a little in favour of women as redress for the disproportion of the harm inflicted on them they do not see that unfairness makes it crucial that the law is never tampered with any injustice would validate the

defendants who are charged with so many offences that they cannot all be dealt with by a single jury trial will face a second judgeonly hearing under plans announced yesterday alongside reform of the domestic violence laws ministers confirmed yesterday that they had failed to resolve a government clash between the home secretary david blunkett and the solicitor general harriet harman over whether the defence of provocation should be abolished in domestic violence and other murder cases the home office minister lady scotland said it was still an open question as to whether the results of a short law commission inquiry looking at partial defences to murder including provocation and a tony martin form of selfdefence would be available in time to be included in the bill she made clear that simply scrapping the defence of provocation as advocated by ms harman could lead to more miscarriages of justice the defence was sometimes used by battered women who were led to kill abusive partners after years of ritual and systematic abuse ms harmans campaign to scrap the provocation defence led to confusion yesterday after a home office press release was hastily revised when it incorrectly said the reform of the provocation defence would be contained in the bill there was also confusion after ms harman suggested the legislation would contain powers to grant anonymity to domestic violence victims it emerged the powers are already on the statute book and will be implemented in january the domestic violence victims and witnesses bill published yesterday includes powers for police and courts to deal with domestic violence they include a fiveyear prison sentence for a breach of a stay away nonmolestation order giving criminal courts the power to issue a restraining order even when the defendant has been acquitted and a decision to make common assault an arrestable offence so a police officer can intervene without a warrant as expected it will also introduce an offence of familial homicide to close a loophole under which parents accused of their childs murder escape punishment by remaining silent or blaming each other the bill also contains wider reforms of the criminal justice system including a new method of dealing with criminals who commit so many offences that they cannot be dealt with by a jury trial this has been a particular problem in multiple thefts fraud counterfeiting and internet child pornography the traditional way of dealing with those who have committed or more offences was to try only specimen counts before a jury but the judge would sentence on the total pattern of offending an appeal court ruling in stopped this practice and said the criminal could only be sentenced on the basis of the charges on which he or she had been tried before a jury lady scotland said this meant that the offender was not punished for the vast majority of offences committed the bill proposes to remedy this by introducing a twostage trial with an offender facing sample charges before a jury and the rest dealt with by a judge sitting alone the bar council last night said it welcomed the overall thrust of the bill but criticised the proposal to deal with multiple offending saying the home office appeared to have a slight fetish about reducing access to jury trials main points new police and court powers to deal with violence including

people accused of domestic violence will face new court orders forcing them to stay away from their partners even if they are acquitted by a court it was confirmed today the solicitorgeneral harriet harman said the new domestic violence crime and victims bill published later today would create a yellow card system as one of many measures to protect men and women from abusive partners the bill which is the first domestic violence legislation in more than years will cover gay couples unmarried heterosexual couples and married couples the prime minister tony blair has given his personal backing to the bill which ms harman has said will mean no more excuses for domestic violence the stay away order will be issued in the magistrates and crown courts where there is a conviction for domestic violence but also crucially where there has been an acquittal said ms harman courts will be able even as they are acquitting the defendant to ensure the victims safety by ordering him to stay away ms harman described the order as a yellow card to abusive partners breach of the order will itself be a criminal offence punishable by up to five years in prison in a speech to a domestic violence conference organised by womens aid and the womens national commission she added this will offer real protection to victims we often talk in government about the importance of diverting offenders particularly young offenders out of the criminal justice system earlier in this case we want more offenders diverted into the criminal justice system at an early stage because then we can ensure that their behaviour is addressed and they receive the appropriate punishment for their crime she said the bill will also make common assault an arrestable offence new multiagency domestic homicide reviews will be established to learn more about the circumstances behind every domestic killing in a bid to avoid them being repeated courts will also get new powers to grant anonymity to domestic violence victims ms harman said she hoped the bill would eventually contain measures to abolish the defence of provocation in homicide cases which allows a husband to claim he was provoked into killing his wife or vice versa mr blair today described the bill as a symbol of our determination to rebalance the whole criminal justice system around the needs of the victim writing in the sun newspaper today the prime minister described domestic violence as a sickening crime which has hidden in the shadows for far too long adding that the crime was far more common than people thought and happened to all ages backgrounds and classes the chief executive of the law society janet paraskeva today welcomed the bill with some reservations solicitors have a key role in helping victims of domestic violence and the law society will be anxious to ensure a proper balance between the roles played by the civil and criminal justice systems in achieving the aims of this worthwhile bill she said however she added we are concerned by the proposal which would allow a criminal court to make a civil order against a person whom it has just acquitted of criminal charges we believe that the criminal court should refer the case to the family court for consideration of the issue although one in four women and one in six men will experience domestic violence over their lifetimes less than of actual domestic violence is reported to the police according to government research every year around women and men are killed by a current or former partner,2003-12,people accused domestic

legislation introducing the biggest overhaul of the domestic violence laws for years is to be published today with a behindthescenes clash between david blunkett and harriet harman unresolved over whether a provocation defence should be abolished in such murder cases the domestic violence bill will also contain a controversial proposal for a stayaway order which courts may impose even when the defendant has been acquitted and which will carry a prison sentence of up to five years ministers will also announce that they intend to introduce a new offence of causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult known as familial homicide this will close a loophole in a small number of cases where both parents jointly accused of the murder of their children have escaped justice because they have remained silent or blamed each other in one recent case a fouryearold boy was found with wounds on his body including adult bite marks his foster parents were sentenced to eight years for child cruelty but could not be charged with murder because the police could not prove who struck the fatal blow the dispute between ministers over whether or not to scrap the defence of provocation will be fuelled today by ms harman the solicitor general when she makes a strong plea to abolish this defence in a text released last night ms harman admitted she had not yet persuaded all her colleagues to include it in the legislation my own view and this is not as yet government policy is that the provocation defence should be abolished she said she was not happy with the defence which re duced murder to manslaughter as it led to the defendant arguing yes i killed her but its not my fault its her fault because she provoked me ms harman said the effect was to blame the victim for her own death but mr blunkett the home secretary is believed to be strongly resisting the move on the grounds that it is also used by women who commit offences after years of abuse by men they would have much less legal protection if this was removed said a home office source the government has tried to resolve this dispute by asking the law commission to undertake a quick inquiry into the issue it is not only looking at the defence of provocation and diminished responsibility in domestic violence cases it is also looking at whether there should be a new tony martin defence this would include situations where although the defendant was entitled to use force in selfdefence he killed in circumstances in which a plea of selfdefence is not available because the use of force was excessive in an unusual move the law commission is due to report in the spring in time for any amendments to be included in the domestic violence bill before it reaches the statute book the law society has also raised concerns about the governments plans for restraining or stayaway orders which would be used like a yellow card so that the defendant would face prison if he disobeyed it ms harman said the new stayaway civil order with its criminal penalties if it were breached would be available to magistrates and crown courts even in cases where the defendant had been acquitted on criminal charges janet paraskeva the president of the law society said she had strong reservations about the use of a civil order against someone just acquitted of criminal charges we believe that the criminal court should refer the case to the family court for consideration of the issue ms harman said i hope that the fact that we are having a bill on domestic violence the first legislation in over years will in itself help to challenge some of the old attitudes it will make it clear that the states view is that domestic violence is always unacceptable,2003-12,legislation introducing biggest

it gets me out of the house for half an hour says lisa birks with a laugh which is quickly taken up by the other mums seated in the small circle it sounds as good an excuse as any for a woman with six children under seven and another on the way to have a break once a week the mums are talking about games and toys specifically those which would be best for their childrens development and education some of the said tots are crawling and toddling over the nursery floor checking out play equipment but is this much of a break under the gentle guidance of jean oakes the nursery teacher leading this active parenting session the mums are deconstructing the mathematical potential of a big felt version of snakes and ladders in which teddy bears are used instead of counters threeyearolds get to recognise the numbers and fouryearolds pick up the concept of one more or one less she says parenting classes such as this which according to the explanatory blurb aim to bring about significant improvement in educational attainment by whole communities of children from their birth by working with parents and carers are not uncommon this one at the nightingale infants nursery in osmanton an area of inner derby which scores highly on all the poverty indicators is one of in the city the difference here though is that they are a strand of a grandiose sounding scheme derby styles itself a city of learning and the parenting courses are part of it what exactly this means is quite hard to grasp and it appears almost as tricky to convey for the people who run it although they clarify its ambitious aims were a learning partnership of people from across the public private and voluntary sectors who have a concern in developing learning through the city says arshad iqbal the schemes coordinator the goals include raising achievement at all stages of learning and for all ages and groups in the city encouraging people and groups to learn particularly those who havent much previously creating a stimulating and highquality learning environment for all communicating to everyone the benefits of learning and establishing effective ways of engaging with current and potential learners and identifying learner needs overseeing the venture is a member executive board with representatives from derby university and derby college the city council rolls royce the local learning and skills council and others what derby has so skilfully done is to get business involved which can be difficult said sue cara director for programmes and policy for the national adult education organisation niace a fervent supporter of the venture suffice to say that for the city of learning notion which began in derby in the mid s the hour has come it is one inspiration for a scheme which ivan lewis minister for adult learning is due to unveil tomorrow lewis flagged up his enthusiasm for learning communities in the skills white paper published in july there is no secret that the relevant section was inserted into the papers final draft at his insistence at a conference the minister will try to explain his idea which he hopes will finally break into the cycle of low skills and educational attainment and the consequent economic disadvantage and social exclusion that persists through the generations in many families if your mum and dad failed at school because their parents had little time for it there was a strong chance that you will not get the support at home which is crucial to school success in far too many families theres intergenerational low aspiration lewis says if mums and dads grans and grandads get involved in learning even after a year break its far more likely that theyll feel the confidence and the need to help their children and its not only boosted their knowledge and skills but its boosted their selfesteem confidence and relationships education becomes a vehicle for aspiration whereas historically they perhaps havent recognised it in those terms the white paper states that one way to interrupt the dismal cycle of low aspiration is to encourage individuals families and employers to see themselves as members of the learning community so how will this work lewis is convinced it will need a more concerted approach as is happening in derby by educational institutions and organisations in the public private and voluntary sectors to stimulate public demand for learning im trying to get people to think differently about linking together what we are doing with children and young people and what were doing with adults and really attacking this culture of low aspiration and ambition for instance its become very fashionable for people these days to belong to leisure clubs he says its trendy even if people dont actually attend them its regarded as high status we need to achieve a similar status and value for learning you could have a similar membership card of a learning community it may entitle you to sample taster courses to take advantage of family learning opportunities to get regular information about learning opportunities in your communities lewis stresses that the government will be in no way prescriptive about such learning communities he will be looking for all the regions to come up with or so testbed learning communities to flesh out his vision such a testbed lc will be an aspiring and ambitious community where people are motivated and want to learn and where they and organisations provide mutual support to help each other what ministers want is a range of examples of good cooperation between a whole range of learning and skills provision they also want them to investigate models of lewis club membership idea to raise the status of learning and they want them to go big on family learning wed like to get some of these learning communities off the ground by april and may the minister says but he accepts that results will take longer you dont change culture in minutes probably not in years its a
