new parents returning to work could receive greater protection from redundancy under government proposals the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis will launch a consultation on friday which will look at extending the legal protection against redundancy for pregnant and new mothers so it continues for up to six months after they return to work it will also consult on affording the same protections to parents returning from adoption leave or shared parental leave the equality act of currently sets out a protected period during which women who are pregnant or have recently given birth are explicitly protected from discrimination the period runs from the start of a pregnancy until the woman returns to work after maternity leave or two weeks after the end of the pregnancy if she is not entitled to maternity leave there are currently no such protections for parents adopting children or those taking shared parental leave research commissioned by beis in collaboration with the equality and human rights commission ehrc in found that one in nine women had been fired or made redundant when they returned to work after having a child or were treated so badly they felt forced out of their job theresa may said people in this country already benefit from some of the most rigorous workplace standards in the world including parental leave and pay entitlements but we are determined to do even more as we leave the eu the prime minister added its unacceptable that too many parents still encounter difficulties when returning to work todays proposals are set to provide greater protection for new parents in the workplace and put their minds at ease at this important time justine roberts mumsnets founder said the websites users talked a lot about pregnancy and maternity discrimination and that of the women it surveyed in said having children affected their careers for the worse its a multifaceted problem requiring a change in attitude and culture as well as legislation but stronger legal protection is a very welcome first step said roberts joeli brearley founder of pregnant then screwed which works against maternity or pregnancy discrimination described the proposals as just papering over the cracks she said that having a protected period seemed to have little effect and pointed to the ehrc research which showed that of women were made redundant while pregnant while on maternity leave and on their return from maternity leave more mothers are made redundant when the enhanced protections exist than when they dont proving that the enhanced protections which are already in place are not working so what is the point of extending them she said the problem isnt the law the law is very clear it is illegal to make someone redundant due to pregnancy or maternity among the problems she said were that legislation did not support fathers to take time out of work to look after children and that childcare was prohibitively expensive women are often unable to return to work thereby reinforcing the outdated notion that all mothers want to stay at home with their kids and arent interested in a career she said until we solve these issues and create a society where women can be both breadwinner and caregiver we will never reduce discrimination in the workplace,2019-01,new parent returning work could receive

and adoption has been tabled today for the houses agreement on monday january this is a step forward removing the choice between parliamentary and parental responsibilities and helping to make parliament a more modern workplace she said siddiq who was advised by doctors to have a caesarean section after complications in the birth of her first daughter azalea voted in a wheelchair last week

infant or newlyadopted child and will be administered by the speaker with the proxy vote cast by another member or a whip the change takes the form of a temporary standing order the pilot allows for the procedure committee to review the success of the scheme before the end of the pilot after which it is hoped it can be rolled out on a permanent basis the full practical details of how the scheme

was one of hundreds since they started dating in that natalie now fully realises amounted to domestic abuse she ultimately walked out of the home she shared with her husband in essex on june and just three months later on october he was handed a twoyear jail sentence after pleading guilty to engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour the guardian understands the government is considering a review of the effectiveness of coercive control offence to improve understanding raise awareness and increase the number of prosecutions as part of the domestic abuse bill announced on monday the statutory guidance and crown prosecution service legal guidance for the controlling or coercive behaviour offence has been updated natalie says she understands that controlling and coercive behaviour with its absence of physical violence is still an abstract concept to some and wants to share her experience so others might recognise they are victims too the main reason for me to talk about what happened is i suffered so alone i became ill and i dont want people to get to that stage she says nobody is alone theres lots of support out there womens aid says perpetrators of coercive and controlling behaviour are still not feeling full force of the law despite it becoming a criminal offence in in and less than offenders were convicted for coercive and controlling behaviour while the police have made some progress in how they respond to this crime in the year police forces recorded coercive control offences natalie describes the first months of her relationship with her partner whom she asked not to be named as ok but now she has removed herself from the relationship realises were red flags from the beginning most notably he constantly phoned her throughout their relationship to phone calls a day would not be unusual she answered them all otherwise he would become angry it was after months that they moved in together and his aggressive behaviour emerged he would throw her belongings out of the house over the neighbours fence he would shout at her and bang items on work surfaces but these periods would pass and he would attempt to appease her with gifts and promises there were times of intimidation and bullying but it was not constant it was every now and then she says but the aggression always returned he damaged her belongings he smashed the kitchen she would return from work and he would break out into a rage for no clear reason natalie started to question her sanity he started blaming everything on me she says i act like this because its your fault until the last year i thought i was going insane i would experience severe panic attacks and anxiety attacks he also attempted to bring in natalies family sending them messages expressing concern about their mental health he was so clever in some ways she says very manipulative at one point in august he was arrested under the malicious communications act for making threats to kill over the phone he was charged and handed a suspended sentence for a few weeks natalie left him but he drew her back in with pleas for mercy he was saying youre the best thing that ever happened to me i cant get through this without you it was the guilt that kept me with him i had started to completely neglect myself another year passed and the relationship continued to worsen he was screaming and shouting at me he lost control in public it would really embarrass me hed shout i hate you fuck off it was horrible after the wedding ring was pawned natalie started to video his behaviour at first not to collect evidence but to reassure that she was not seeing or hearing things i recorded videos to check i was not going insane and because i knew i would have to take it to the police she says on june she called her friend and told her to pick her up she arrived at her brothers house and told her family the full story she resolved to report her husband to the police and she said the officers who dealt with the case went way above and beyond and dealt with her case sensitively and professionally she handed over her diary notes messages call history and crucially around

partner thats when you have an issue she says if youre too scared to even have a conversation katie ghose chief executive of womens aid said survivors may worry that if they have no evidence of

highrisk domestic abuse offenders could face mandatory liedetector tests when released from prison under longawaited proposals published on monday the home office meanwhile has released analysis that puts the cost of domestic abuse in england and wales at about bn a year the polygraph tests piloted on offenders on licence are part of a broad package of measures under the domestic abuse bill which also includes in a victory for campaigners who pressed the government on the issue a ban on the crossexamination of victims by their abusers in the family courts other measures include the introduction of domestic abuse protection orders which will place restrictions on offenders and the introduction of the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative nonphysical abuse alongside the bill the home office released research on the cost of domestic abuse to society the majority of the cost bn is attributed to the physical and emotional harm caused by domestic abuse but the bn total also includes other factors such as the cost to health services of bn the cost to police of bn and and the cost to victim services of m the prime minister theresa may said throughout my political career i have worked to bring an end to domestic abuse and support survivors as they take the brave decision to leave their abuser and rebuild their lives we know from the harrowing experiences of victims and their families that there is still more to do to stamp out this lifeshattering crime and the domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the changes we need to achieve this the minister for crime safeguarding and vulnerability victoria atkins said i have heard absolutely heartbreaking accounts of victims whose lives have been ripped apart because of physical emotional or economic abuse they have suffered by someone close to them the draft domestic abuse bill recognises the complex nature of these horrific crimes and puts the needs of victims and their families at the forefront this government is absolutely committed to shining a light on domestic abuse to ensure this hidden crime does not remain in the shadows domestic violence charities broadly welcomed the bill but said resources should be made available to ensure it was effective katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said domestic abuse costs lives and it costs money it is happening at epidemic levels yet it has been largely hidden behind closed doors now is the time to bring it out into the spotlight and address the impact of domestic abuse properly once and for all the domestic abuse bill has the potential to create a stepchange in the national response and this must be backed up with sustainable funding for our lifesaving network of specialist support services to make a real difference to survivors lives about million adults are estimated to have experienced domestic abuse each year affecting almost of all adults women are twice as likely to be victims than men under domestic abuse protection orders perpetrators could be required to attend rehabilitation programmes where substance abuse was a factor in that abuse or other behaviour change programmes the legislation will introduce automatic eligibility for victims for special measures in criminal courts to reduce the stress of giving evidence in criminal proceedings and will include the appointment of a domestic abuse commissioner who will work to ensure that services are provided the statutory guidance and crown prosecution service legal guidance for the offence of controlling or coercive behaviour will also be updated sandra horley the chief executive of refuge said the cost of domestic violence to womens and childrens lives is devastating but now the immense cost to the taxpayer has been laid bare too domestic violence is truly everybodys business this bill represents a onceinageneration opportunity to address domestic violence but in order to do so we must ensure its aspirations are matched by adequate resource we will continue to work closely with the government to ensure the final bill meets the needs of the women and children we support suzanne jacob obe the chief executive of safelives said the government estimates today that perpetrators cost the economy bn more than the cost of alcohol and drug misuse cigarettes and obesity combined it affects more than million people every year for too long weve expected victims and children to uproot their lives while the perpetrators remain invisible and unchallenged by the system the new change in approach reflects what hundreds of survivors told safelives they wanted were pleased the government is listening the draft bill will introduce measures to address coercive control and economic abuse how domestic abuse affects children and transform the response in the justice system a series of nonlegislative measures were also announced including m of home office funding to support children affected by domestic abuse implementing a domestic abuse specialist in each jobcentre who will receive further training on how to support claimants who are

domestic abusers will no longer be able to crossexamine their former partners in family courts under a comprehensive government package of reforms to tackle the issue the landmark draft domestic abuse bill published tomorrow after an month delay will prevent victims from being subjected to the abhorrent practice of being interrogated in court by their abusers alongside other measures designed to raise awareness support survivors and tackle perpetrators the development which has been broadly welcomed by campaigners comes as new analysis estimates that the social cost of domestic abuse in was bn more than the amount caused by alcohol and drug misuse cigarettes and obesity combined measures in the draft bill include the first statutory government definition of domestic abuse the appointment of a commissioner dedicated to tackling the issue and new protection orders to force perpetrators to attend rehabilitation programmes where substance abuse is a factor or behaviour change programmes prime minister theresa may said we know from the harrowing experiences of victims and their families that there is still more to do to stamp out this lifeshattering crime and the domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the changes we need to achieve this it represents a stepchange in our approach and i am grateful to the charities victims campaign groups and frontline agencies who have worked alongside us to ensure we get this right sarah green codirector of the end violence against women coalition said the ambition and determination in the governments announcement of the new bill is very welcome given the devastation this abuse causes however if law policy and spending really are to be radically changed in this area it is absolutely critical that there is clear recognition that domestic violence very disproportionately affects women this is not to say that men are not also sometimes victimised but womens inequality is part of what drives some mens sense that they are entitled to bully and control in their relationships green also urged future work to examine the complex links between domestic abuse and other forms of abuse including sexual violence stalking and harassment forced marriage trafficking and prostitution tomorrows announcement comes after the government launched a consultation into domestic abuse last year that drew responses from more than people it is estimated that about two million adults experience domestic abuse each year the bill will be published alongside government research that calculated the social and economic costs of domestic abuse as totalling more than per individual victim or bn per year the amount was calculated by looking at the costs of protective and preventative measures the consequences and the response by police and the wider justice system the vast majority of this cost bn was a result of the physical and emotional harm of domestic abuse it included other factors such as the cost to health services bn police bn and victim services m the government originally intended to prohibit alleged domestic abusers crossexamining their victims in the family court through its prisons and courts bill

the government has rejected calls to force mediumsized companies to reveal their gender pay gaps as of firms with more than employees have to publish figures about their gender pay gap this leaves half of the uk workforce without knowledge of their workplaces gap the business energy and industrial strategy committee beis published a report in august that called on the government to be more ambitious with its new gender pay gap reporting regime it recommended that all companies with more than employees be forced to report their pay gap from in a response published on thursday the government said that the threshold to qualify for gender pay gap reporting regulations was consulted on prior to and that over half of respondents agreed with the threshold given the range of metrics required it was felt that reporting could be particularly burdensome for small and mediumsized businesses and so the requirement should be restricted to large employers the response said the government said that gender pay gap figures for smaller organisations were unreliable as they were more sensitive to small changes like people leaving and pay rises it added that it would consult on the feasibility of changing the threshold if there was appetite after this reporting year the committees report also recommended that the pay of company partners be included in gender pay gap reporting saying the exclusion of the highest paid people in organisations makes a nonsense of efforts to understand the scale of and reasons behind the gender pay gap the government response said the regulations exclude partners in traditional partnerships and limited liability partnerships from the gender pay gap calculations because partners are not paid but instead take a share of the profits which is not directly comparable with employees pay it added that while there would be no changes this year they were looking at clarifying the reporting guidance on partner pay in future years commenting on the government response rachel reeves chair of the beis select committee said next year is the th anniversary of the equal pay act and yet still we are tackling issues around fairness in pay the uk has one of the highest gender pay gaps in europe pay reporting can only be the first step in closing this gap and moving towards genuine equality and diversity in the workplace she said that the governments decision not to accept their recommendations showed they were timid in holding businesses to account for their efforts in driving the change needed penny mordaunt minister for women and equalities said in the first year of mandatory gender pay gap reporting over employers had reported their data as had of those required to do so by law our worldleading reporting regulations

obscure parliamentary procedures are currently all the rage from john bercows controversial deviation from precedence in selecting amendments to business motions and the arcane voting procedure requiring mps to physically go through division lobbies or be nodded through for which they still have to be on parliament grounds for their vote to be counted the decision by the labour mp tulip siddiq to delay the caesarean birth of her second child to vote in the crucial brexit debate on tuesday night and the confidence vote on wednesday night has reignited the debate over proxy voting and reminded the country that the conservatives have a fundamental problem with women despite parliament agreeing in principle last february to implement proxy voting party whips have yet to facilitate a system for those mps who most need it mainly pregnant people and parents this is not just a fetishised obsession with parliamentary tradition but a cold calculation on the part of the tory party it has a lower proportion of women mps compared to other parties just out of and is therefore less likely to have insufficient numbers to carry a vote in the absence of a pregnant or new parent mp it has put its own interests above a persons fundamental right to safely carry and deliver their children and to have adequate time off to parent those children indeed it was the breakdown of the pairing system over the summer when the conservative party chairman brandon lewis mp apparently forgot to abstain in a crucial brexit vote to offset the absence of liberal democrat mp jo swinson who was on maternity leave that led siddiq to make her decision she could not trust that system to function properly images of a heavily pregnant siddiq on the floor of parliament in a wheelchair brought expectedly mixed reactions fellow labour politicians and feminist activists rightly pointed out the absurdity of forcing a heavily pregnant woman to be physically present in parliament to cast possibly crucial votes instead of implementing a modern proxy vote others were predictably derisive in their dismissal of siddiqs decision as a publicity stunt at best an act made in the words of conservative mp kemi badenoch simply to prove a point siddiqs decision also brought out the twitter trolls who opined that she was already a bad mother for having to make an impossible choice between country and family it is a choice she should never have had to make but are such attitudes surprising with a party such as the tories the party that took away child benefit for families with more than two children unless the mother could prove she was raped the party that cut funding to womens shelters and appointed an antichoice campaigner to party vicechair for women the government that hopped into bed with the dup a similarly backwardslooking party whose oppression of northern irish women through the denial of their reproductive rights would have made any other party appropriately squeamish while society as a whole is arguably not much better at protecting the rights of women or those who are pregnant whether at work in the home or simply out on the street we rightly expect parliament to do better and to lead us to a place where the rights of the marginalised and disadvantaged are robustly protected and not treated as bargaining chips but parliament was built by and for men the evidence is everywhere and nowhere will one find stauncher defenders of this ignominious status quo than in the conservative party certainly a party that restores the whip to two mps suspended while under investigation for harassment and other sexual offences in order to win a vote is not one that can be trusted to bring the interests of women and pregnant people to the fore the refusal to implement a proxy vote system is another symptom of the conservative problem with women and their willingness to put parliamentary maths above human rights and dignity elizabeth nelson is an activist

the conservative vicechairman kemi badenoch has provoked labour anger after she accused the heavily pregnant opposition mp tulip siddiq of making a point by insisting on voting in tuesday evenings brexit debate badenoch said she had heard siddiq speak on this issue privately before and that she was choosing to go to westminster to vote because she wants to make a point she is doing this for her constituents the conservative was speaking on the bbcs politics live a day after it emerged that siddiq had delayed a caesarean section by two days so she could vote against mays brexit deal in the commons badenoch added that it was not necessary for siddiq to take the trouble to vote conceding that mays deal was expected to be heavily defeated and arguing that one vote isnt going to make a difference the conservatives say they have offered siddiq a pair in which they would ask one of their loyal mps to abstain so that the labour mps absence would not affect the overall result but shortly after badenochs interview siddiq tweeted that my decision to delay my babys birth is not one i take lightly she added that she had no faith in the pairing system she said that in july the govt stole the vote of new mother referring to a previous episode when the conservative chairman brandon lewis voted in a crucial brexit debate despite being paired with the lib dem mp jo swinson who was at the time on maternity leave other labour mps criticised badenochs suggestion that siddiqs actions were politically motivated louise haigh demanded that badenoch make an immediate apology while diana johnson said siddiq was having to make a point because of the cruel decisions of a maledominated government whips office siddiq will travel to westminster to vote in the brexit debate with her husband her office has arranged with the commons authorities for her to be picked up in a wheelchair allowing her to be pushed through the division lobby to ensure her vote is counted it is theoretically possible for siddiq to be nodded through if she simply makes it on to the westminster estate a system whereby a member who is physically unable to make it through the commons division lobbies can have their vote counted but it is understood that siddiq wants to go through the lobby in person again because she is concerned that the conservatives will not honour the system the labour backbencher naz shah was pushed through the division lobby in a wheelchair while wearing pyjamas last june at a time when she was recovering from a serious illness because the conservatives refused to allow her to be nodded through on thursday john bercow the commons speaker said that siddiq should be allowed to vote by proxy meaning that her vote be counted in her absence she would have been the first mp to be allowed to vote in this fashion but while conservative sources said a proxy would be offered this had not taken place,2019-01,conservative vicechairman kemi badenoch ha provoked labour

john bercow has told parliament the labour mp tulip siddiq should be allowed to have a proxy for the brexit vote on tuesday so she does not have to delay having a baby by caesarean section in order to get to westminster the speaker of the house of commons said it was time reactionary forces were overcome and demanded conservative and labour whips introduce the proxy system immediately so siddiq does not have to go through the division lobby in a wheelchair it is understood siddiq who is heavily pregnant will travel to westminster to vote in the brexit debate after delaying a planned caesarean by two days responding to a point of order raised by harriet harman bercow called on andrea leadsom the leader of the commons and the whips in both main parties to act immediately to agree a proxy vote for siddiq the speaker said the notion that an mp would have to be pushed through the division lobby in a wheelchair is completely uncivilised and repeatedly described the situation as lamentable harman said siddiq should not have to choose between going through the division lobby in a wheelchair nine months pregnant having postponed her caesarean or losing her right to vote conservative sources said that labour whips had not asked to pair siddiq or arrange for her to be nodded through they added if she wanted a proxy to vote for her it would be organised as soon as possible earlier siddiq told the evening standard she intended to vote in person if my son enters the world even one day later than the doctors advised but its a world with a better chance of a strong relationship between britain and europe then thats worth fighting for it would be the first time an mp has been allowed to have another person vote on their behalf so they do not have to travel to westminster in order to be counted and make good on a promise agreed in a commons debate in february last year those unable to make it through the division lobbies have traditionally had to get on to the parliamentary estate in an ambulance if necessary in order to be nodded through although that only applies if whips from both sides agree otherwise mps have to make their way through the division lobbies in person on monday night aides said siddiq had asked to ensure she can be driven to westminster and a wheelchair will be made available so she can vote relations between conservative and labour whips have deteriorated in the past year with claims the government resorted to dirty tricks and playing hardball in order to win key votes the labour backbencher naz shah was pushed through the division lobby in a wheelchair while wearing pyjamas last june at a time when she was recovering from a serious illness because the conservatives refused to allow her to be nodded through brandon lewis the conservative chairman controversially voted in two knifeedge brexit votes last july when he was supposed to abstain to honour an agreed pairing with the liberal democrat mp jo swinson who was on maternity leave at the time siddiq told the standard if the pairing system is not honoured theres nothing i can do and its going to be a very close vote ive had no pressure at all from the whips to come and vote but this is the biggest vote of my lifetime,2019-01,john bercow ha told parliament labour mp tulip siddiq allowed proxy brexit vote tuesday doe delay baby caesarean section

what is gender pay gap reporting and what is being published changes to the equality act which came into force on april made it compulsory for companies in great britain but not northern ireland with more than employees to report their gender pay gap figures at the end of every financial year public bodies must report by march and private companies must do so by april organisations are also required to publish the breakdown of men and women in different pay quartiles and details of the proportion of men and women in the company who receive bonuses last year was the first year that the rule came into force data submitted by the deadline showed men were paid more than women in out of companies and public bodies in britain based on the median hourly pay the figures showed that no sector paid women better on average than men the construction sector had the worst average median gender pay gap at finance and insurance were next at the accommodation and food services sector had the best pay gap at what is the gender pay gap the gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of a companys male and female employees if an organisation has for example a gender pay gap it means that women earn an average of less per hour excluding overtime than men or in other words the average female employee would earn p for every earned by a male employee a negative gender pay gap would mean women earned an average of more than men per hour according to the onss latest annual survey of hours and earnings ashe the gender pay gap for median gross hourly earnings fell to among fulltime employees in from the year before it was in when the ons first collected the data when all workers full and parttime are included the gap increases to this is likely to be because more women work in parttime jobs which tend to be lower paid according to the ons in the gender pay gap for fulltime employees between the ages of and years was close to zero but began to widen for people over the age of when both full and parttime employees are included in the calculation the gender pay gap widens after the age of this coincides with an increase in parttime working whats the difference between the mean and the median figures when talking about the gender pay gap people tend to talk about the median figure rather than the mean the mean is calculated by adding up all of the wages of employees in a company and dividing that figure by the number of employees this means the final figure can be skewed by a small number of highly paid individuals the median is the number that falls in the middle of a range when everyones wages are lined up from smallest to largest and is more representative when there is a lot of variation in pay is the data reliable individual companies and public bodies are responsible for publishing their own gender pay gaps using guidance from the government equalities office however the guardian reported last year that a number of companies had filed mathematically impossible results with gender pay gaps of more than as of february this year that was still the case with hundreds of companies gender pay gap records still including inaccurate figures does it mean women are being paid less than men in the same roles no while some employers might be paying men and women differently for performing the same role or work of equivalent value this is an issue of equal pay it is illegal to pay men and women different amounts for the same work however that is not what gender pay gap reporting is set up to measure rather these figures show us the overall gender pay gap as well as the bonus pay gap and the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the pay structure of the company what will happen if companies dont report the equality and human rights commission ehrc is responsible for enforcing gender pay gap reporting rules and said that while it would approach employers informally at first if they failed to publish figures by the deadline businesses could ultimately face unlimited fines and convictions however information published following a freedom of information request by the guardian showed that no companies have been fined to date despite hundreds failing to accurately file their gender pay gap figures on time an employer would only be fined if a case were to reach the courts,2019-02,gender

inaccurate figures and a lack of sanctions risk making a mockery of the gender pay gap reporting system critics have warned following an indepth guardian analysis of submissions amid concerns that a lack of transparency and inaccurate reporting is undermining efforts to address pay inequality mathematically impossible gender pay gap data filed by companies for last year has yet to be corrected and with less than a month to go before this years reporting deadline the equality and human rights commission ehrc admitted that despite those errors no companies have yet been fined for failing to comply with legislation the deadline for companies to report their gender pay gap figures for is march for public bodies and april for private companies however more than companies are yet to file accurate data for the previous period with the equalities office and a number have filed mathematically impossible figures this year analysis also shows a further companies have filed or resubmitted their figures since last years deadline the shadow secretary for women and equalities dawn butler said gender pay gap reporting was meant to provide transparency but the fact that companies have given inaccurate data and faced no sanctions makes a mockery of the whole system responding to a freedom of information request the ehrc which is responsible for enforcing the gender pay gap reporting rules said it had sent enforcement letters to companies on april in relation to last years figures and all companies required to submit data had subsequently filed gender pay gap information however inaccurate figures still remain on the government portal ehrc said they had completed enforcement against employers who submitted suspiciouslooking data last year they said that while they were not currently pursuing enforcement action against any companies who reported last year that didnt mean they couldnt do so retrospectively however employers appear to still be filing figures for as of february days before the reporting deadline last year the guardian reported that a number of companies had filed mathematically impossible results with gender pay gaps of more than some companies had entered zeros in all fields reported mathematically impossible bonus gaps and removed key workers from their figures ehrcs chief executive rebecca hilsenrath responded to the figures by saying we have mechanisms in place to identify questionable data and have the power to enforce against any employer whose published information doesnt comply with the legal requirements but guardian analysis of company filings which were due on april show that employers still have filed mathematically impossible figures according to ehrc guidance on enforcing gender pay gap regulations employers who submit data that has not been calculated in accordance with the gender pay gap reporting will be in breach of the regulations and subject to enforcement action in the same way as those who publish no data at all the organisations enforcement policy says that in the first instance they write to organisations that fail to file their gender pay gap information setting out the law and asking them to comply within days if an employer fails to do so the ehrc can eventually apply for a court order which could then lead to a financial penalty among the companies that missed the deadline for submission or refiled their results for are the ministry of justice the law society arriva plc and lk bennett so far a total of companies have reported their gender pay gaps this year out of which are expected to file banks have filed some of the most egregious gender pay gap figures barclays bank plc reported a median gap of meaning on average women are paid p for every a man earns at the company that figure widens to a median bonus gap meaning on average women are awarded p to every awarded to a man in bonus pay the bank also disclosed women only account for of its highest paid staff the data does not show significant changes on the reported figures when the hourly pay gap stood at and the bonus gap stood at there has also been no change in the gender diversity among the top earners at the bank lloyds bank plc reported a median gap of while royal bank of scotland reported a median gap of lloyds banking group reported a pay gap of and pricewaterhousecoopers had a gap of butler said that the ehrc should be encouraged to use the full force of its powers to force companies to comply with the law news that the gender pay gap is growing in hundreds of companies is extremely worrying and this latest failure in reporting raises serious questions about the governments commitment to tackle this issue the next labour government will require employers to publish action plans or face auditing or fines thats how to close the gender pay gap an ehrc spokesperson said it is an employers responsibility to ensure that their figures are correct our enforcement against data which looked inaccurate or unlikely has found that they were a result of errors rather than a deliberate attempt to mislead we have worked closely with employers to identify and correct errors and have written to those we believe to have inaccurate data this has been a steep learning curve for employers and as they get to grips with the calculations it is likely that fewer errors will be made as with any selfreporting law employers can be asked in any reporting year to verify their historical figures and face enforcement action if found to be deliberately misreporting through our enforcement approach we achieved compliance without the need for costly and lengthy legal process which is something to celebrate this article was amended on march due to an editing error an earlier version referred to dawn butler as labours minister for women and equalities butler is the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities the name of the equality and human rights commission was also corrected,2019-02,inaccurate

victims of domestic abuse working for a scottish council will now have the right to take up to days of paid safe leave to give them time to access help and support without sacrificing pay or annual leave inspired by recent legislation enacted in new zealand south ayrshire council approved the groundbreaking policy on tuesday it is believed to be the first local authority in europe to adopt the safe leave provision peter henderson an snp councillor said he hoped other local authorities would follow south ayrshires lead across south ayrshire were committed to supporting the most vulnerable people in our communities and working with our partners to raise awareness of domestic abuse and violence he said as part of these efforts were also leading the way in doing what we can to support our employees who experience such trauma giving abused employees access to up to days safe leave where they can take the time off they need to access help and support without the worry of it affecting their finances or using up their annual leave will make a real and lasting difference that could help change lives forever hazel bingham the manager of south ayrshire womens aid told the guardian she hoped other local authorities and employers would adopt the policy bingham whose organisation provided support to women over the past year said this is a massive step forward that south ayrshire council has taken its so important that women can have this paid leave so that they are able to deal with some of the issues facing them for example they may have to leave their house immediately or get to doctors or lawyers appointments to have to right to paid leave meaning that it is not causing any economic difficulties is common sense she added its very important that this provision is specifically for domestic abuse it needs to be specific because of the problems that leaving a situation of domestic abuse brings to women the new policy sets out that abuse can also encompass controlling and coercive behaviour and states that employees may take time off in order to for example attend legal proceedings seek safe housing or visit legal advisers or support agencies the safe leave can be taken as a block of up to days or as intermittent periods of absence based on needs in the uk the domestic violence helpline is scotlands domestic abuse and forced marriage helpline

in december i read a news article that had me cursing at the computer with rage it was a new york times investigation detailing allegations of poor treatment of mothers by planned parenthood including not offering maternity leave mistreating pregnant workers and discriminating against moms in hiring and promotion so why did this get me so much more worked up than average after all we live in a general cascade of bad news with no shortage of things to be outraged about the story made me particularly angry because in addition to being a mother myself for the last two years ive been researching and reporting on working mothers and the more i learn about motherhood in america the angrier i get many thoughtful articles and interesting books are exploring new levels of anger in the public sphere and theres been a lot of attention on exploring our current renaissance of womens rage while mothers today are rightfully involved in all sorts political organizing and public protests i think we should also make space to be truly pissed about what its actually like to be mother in lets start at the beginning when a woman learns shes pregnant she immediately becomes vulnerable to the epidemic of pregnancy discrimination it appears no industry is immune mothers are more likely to die in childbirth in america than in most industrialized countries and that rate is climbing even more disturbingly black mothers are nearly times more likely to die than white mothers as hospitals try to address this some of them appear more interested in blaming mothers for their own deaths than proactively changing outcomes since we live in the only industrialized country that doesnt mandate paid family leave nearly of mothers go back to work within two weeks of giving birth to give you a sense of where human mothers fall on the legal protection hierarchy its illegal to separate a dog from her newborn pups before eight weeks in several states once we return to work we unfortunately can expect antimom bias in hiring pay and promotions and if a woman has a baby between the ages of and she can expect a lifetime of economic marginalization and diminished earnings while all of this is happening the social expectations of mothers are becoming more intense at home mothers do more housework and childcare than fathers even when both parents work fulltime and mothers today are doing just as much handson parenting as stayathome mothers did in the s we now live in a time where every basic parenting decision like whether its ok to leave a child in a parked car for five minutes is judged analyzed and sometimes even criminalized and studies have a found that mothers are judged more harshly than fathers for making the exact same parenting decisions i believe what it means to be a good mother in this era has become a total farce increasingly out of reach for nonwealthy parents directives now include giving gifts to adult airline passengers who might have to suffer the indignity of hearing your child cry interactively coviewing tv with with your kids rather than taking a few moments of time for yourself while theyre occupied and spending weekend free time shuttling children to expensive and timeconsuming enrichment activities the new york times journalist claire cain millers reporting shows that theres no clear evidence that this form of parenting actually benefits kids and it certainly succeeds at making many mothers stressed and miserable as a society we have a deeply uncomfortable relationship with mothers getting mad but that hasnt stopped us in the past women fueled by anger have invoked their identity as mothers in all kinds of fights for social justice throughout the th and st centuries mary harris known as mother jones was a powerful and fearless labor leader seen as a mother figure to thousands of workers after losing her own children to yellow fever mamie till the mother of the lynched teenager emmett till pushed to allow photos of her murdered son to be publicized which helped galvanize the civil rights movement nationally mothers of course are instrumental to a number of powerful social movements we see today including black lives matter the womens march and teacher strikes but when women invoke their status as mothers in activism as we see with mothers against drunk driving mothers of the movement and moms demand action its nearly universally to advocate for others most notably our children we have not yet seen much angerfueled activism and organizing on behalf of ourselves mothers are right to be feeling some pretty intense emotions about the hand were dealt but instead of bonding together in righteous fury i hear a lot more talk about mom guilt i talk about guilt with mothers every single day says alexandra sacks a reproductive psychiatrist and coauthor of what no one tells you a guide to your emotions from pregnancy to motherhood she notes that moms shes hearing about guilt from arent just those who are seeking psychiatric care but women shes interacting with at lectures workshops and on social media she agrees that as a society we are much more comfortable with mothers expressing guilt than we are with mothers expressing anger guilt and anger actually operate in different parts of the brain guilt is an emotion that operates in the right frontal cortex and encourages a withdrawal motivation causing us to retreat from experiences we find difficult unfortunately no largescale academic research on moms and guilt even exists to help put mothers current experience in historic or crosscultural perspective some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt exists to help enforce social norms and in the case of mothers i dont think many of those norms are doing us any favors if were constantly inundated with the message that were personally doing something wrong this leads to a brain response that shuttles us toward avoidance and isolation rather than outspoken defiance in short guilt keeps mothers quiet anger is different from guilt from a neurological perspective it operates in the left frontal cortex which encourages approach motivation despite its bad rap anger which is different from aggression is actually an outwardly much more productive emotion neural maps of the brain show that anger can energize us to move towards challenges rather than retreating for mothers i think tapping into anger could motivate us to speak up more about the injustices of our experience and take action angry people go to protests sue their employers for discrimination challenge unfair work and legislative policies and demand more from their partners at home and loudly reject intensive parenting i think society would be much better off if we saw a lot more angry mothers doing all of those things you cant organize a group of victims marshall ganz a professor at harvards kennedy school whos an expert in social change recently told the atlantic if people only see themselves that way theres no sense of agency no sense of power but when you tell them that were fighting an injustice or an offense to their dignity they become angry and involved despite all of this im actually optimistic that things are starting to change for moms maybe its because im angry anger actually leads to increased optimism ive spent nearly a year reporting for a new podcast about working mothers for which ive been talking to women across the country from executives to sex workers to politicians to musicians what all of these women have in common is that they are refusing to accept the way things are for mothers in america and they are doing something about it one of the women i spoke to is nydia sanchez who owns a hour childcare center in las vegas that caters to an extremely overlooked group single mothers who work overnight it is amazing what these women do she told me how they stand on their own two feet it is amazing what we as mothers can do and how we stand on our own two feet but i dont think we should just accept our lot in this country because it doesnt have to be this hard and thats why i was so furious about the report on planned parenthood if one of the most prominent womens rights and health organizations has allowed illegal discrimination against mothers and poor treatment of pregnant workers there is no denying what a huge problem we urgently face the upside of that devastating article was that the women interviewed for that story knew what they had experienced was wrong they were mad so they spoke up but whats very clear to me is that no one is coming to stand up for mothers if we dont get angry and stand up for ourselves katherine goldstein is a journalist and the host of the double shift podcast a reported show about a new generation of

when the hampstead and kilburn mp tulip siddiq found out she was pregnant with her second child which must have been roughly nine months and three weeks ago i said to chris my husband thank god its due at the end of january that means i can vote she is sitting in the living room of her new home in kilburn northwest london it is homely because theres a baby in it but she and chris have just moved in and their only furniture is the gigantic plastic toy kitchen belonging to their twoyearold daughter azalea chris she says told me off said that shouldnt be the first thing on my mind but im expecting her to say something a bit more predictable about how obviously the baby comes first not so much my constituency is remain i dont know who the other are because ive never met them in my life i have eu nationals in my constituency every single midwife and doctor i had at the royal free hospital where i had this baby was european i can be doing a downward dog in a pilates class and someone will ask me about their settled status its a really important vote for me as the saying goes if you want to make god laugh tell him your plans the vote on theresa mays brexit deal was to take place on tuesday january due to gestational diabetes siddiq was advised to have a caesarean section at weeks on the same day denied a proxy vote she had two options she could have been nodded through a weird process in which two labour whips and one tory look at you exchange glances with one another in mutual assurance that you are alive and of sound mind and then you go home but she still would have had to turn up at parliament she could have paired with an mp from an opposite party whose vote would have counteracted her own but she discussed that in a crossparty newmummp whatsapp group the lib dem mp jo swinson had her pairing betrayed by conservative mp brandon lewis while she was on maternity leave in july jo just said i really wouldnt trust them you dont understand how i felt breastfeeding my newborn and seeing the pairing had been broken the only way to guarantee her vote would be recorded was to be there in person so she delayed her surgery seeing siddiq arrive in a wheelchair caused public outrage a reminder of how archaic our parliamentary system is that it wouldnt allow a woman who had been scheduled to have a baby a proxy vote why siddiq asks do we expect women to change to suit arcane institutions why cant institutions change the scene of her being wheeled into parliament by her husband then taken into the lobby by labour mp clive lewis hes an army man he was shooing everyone out of the way brought something human to the house and not just from her own party tory mps david davis and nicholas soames offered solidarity they expressed great regret at her predicament and said it wasnt what they would wish for their own wives then came the prime minister she was about to lose the most important vote of her life and she came over and said im really sorry youre in this position i regret we couldnt offer you proxy voting as much as i think she has made policy that has ruined some womens lives it was a very humane thing to do the next day she was granted a proxy vote the first person in history to be allowed this not long after a yearlong trial to allow mps proxy votes in the case of maternity leave paternity leave or adoption was announced siddiq is stoic and describes her medical interactions in a doughty mischievous spirit where people advise her to rest and there are just things she has to do first but haring into westminster the day before a csection was plainly very stressful you cant eat for a certain amount of time they clean your stomach i should really have been preparing for all that instead what do i do im sitting in a cab to go to parliament and have this surreal experience we have this conversation as her baby son raphael lies on her sleeping the tableau brings out an intense protectiveness not because he is so cute or because she is ft in but because he is three weeks old and she is talking in this completely open unguarded way and never mind whether or not the concept of nappy brain is a misogynist conspiracy it seems incredibly unfair to hold anyone to anything they say three weeks after they have just had a child let alone write it down but she has a superb confidence born i think partly because her constituency is in her bones she has been a member of hampstead and kilburn constituency labour party since she was she is now the seat was held by glenda jackson for years and when she stood for selection siddiq was advised why dont you change your name to tulip percy her husbands surname there was a real feeling from the outside that the jewish community wasnt going to accept me she says a feeling that she knew was wrong having canvassed with them since she was in her teens when jo cox was murdered it was the rabbis who were the first to call me to see how they could help i actually do my advice surgeries at jw a jewish community centre now because they have their own security as vicechair of the allparty parliamentary group against antisemitism her line on the continuing row is people who were problematic to begin with years ago are still there and they still cause problems its the same cranks with renewed energy being a homegrown mp she is much more open and less worried that shell get it wrong than other albeit talented mps who have been parachuted in siddiq resigned from the front bench when she refused to vote to trigger article she wants a public vote and oh god the relief of hearing an mp who actually cares about eu nationals even while she wont get any votes from them i have realised that i have it a lot easier she says im a staunch remainer and my constituency is staunch remain its very different for me than it is for stephen kinnock or ed miliband siddiq is from as near as dammit to a political dynasty just not british politics her aunt sheikh hasina is the prime minister of bangladesh her grandfather sheikh mujibur rahman was the countrys first president assassinated in that is not to say she was raised as a future leader my mother was quite discouraging initially she was traumatised by what had happened to her father it does seem to have given her quite a teflon attitude which she has needed since this connection is also the source of great controversy hasina has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups internationally for claims of political disappearances detentions without trial threats by security forces associated with her regime essentially the hallmarks of a police state siddiq for her part has been called upon to intervene by writers in this newspaper which led to a splenetic exchange with a channel producer thanks daisy for coming she said to the pregnant daisy ayliffe after a reporter asked about ahmad bin quasem a britishtrained barrister detained in bangladesh hope you have a great birth because child labour is hard she had to apologise now she says i was just trying to humanise the situation because it had got very heated it seemed like a good time to say look were both human beings i wondered what she would say when i ask about her aunt would she deny the strength of her relationship with her it would be difficult since hasina came to her maiden speech in parliament im personally close to my aunt she says she was the first to call when this baby was born she loves the kids she says im like her own daughter there is an inconsistency she points out that kinnock whose wife is the former danish prime minister helle thorningschmidt never gets asked to intervene in danish politics in the way that she has with bangladeshi politics you dont get to be where she is by listening to your niece on national security issues says siddiq there are two words shed say to me fuck off people need to realise the limitations that i have how far removed i am from it when they ask me to intervene it makes me look a lot more powerful than i am there is clearly a remainer leftbutnotcorbynloyal group of mps in the labour party and i would say siddiq was in it but one of the lesserremarked consequences of the current mess is that only the very obvious cliques and outriders are visible you cant really see new political talent coming together it is hard to say how organised they are do they even have a whatsapp group not for leftremainers but theres a womens plp group a bame one theres the intake and conversations about brexit happen in those siddiq for her part is not taking maternity leave she was doing casework when her baby was three days old that wont wait i cant get a researcher to do it and its a privilege to be an mp i dont resent that arguably she could get a researcher to do casework but feelings of indispensability are not unique among mps she has been asked how long she wants the proxy vote for i havent given a straight answer because i have to see what happens in march she says saddiq is comically driven saying of her husband i made him change his career to support mine so now hes a freelance consultant in education which basically means he can pick up the kids its the same mix of selfparody and deadly seriousness you can hear in her assessment of the last few weeks im dragging parliament into the st century from my hospital bed,2019-02,hampstead

the treasury minister liz truss has pledged to track down christopher chope in parliament next week for a talk as the conservative mp faced potential party action for blocking a planned law aimed at protecting girls from female genital mutilation fgm amid nearuniversal condemnation of the backbencher from tory colleagues after he once again used parliamentary tactics to delay a private members bill chope was also called on by his local party to give an explanation im going to be speaking to him this week truss told skys sophy ridge on sunday show i want to see him change his mind i want to see the conservative party make sure that we show that that is completely unacceptable asked how she would speak to him truss said i will be looking for him around the commons and i think conservatives do need to put peer pressure on our colleagues who are stopping these types of things happening she added when i see one of my colleagues opposing a measure that could have saved girls lives could have saved girls from that horrendous experience i am absolutely appalled by that in a statement christchurch councillors said chope had been invited to explain his actions to the local party association they said they do not believe that pedantry should take precedence over human rights and it is time for the misogynistic old guard to recognise and reflect the opinions of the modern conservative chope who gained notoriety after he blocked a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence used the same commons procedure on friday to block a bill tabled by fellow conservative zac goldsmith shouting object when it was presented for its second reading the fgm proposal called the children act amendment female genital mutilation bill is intended to improve the law that prohibited the practice by allowing family courts to make interim care orders about children deemed at risk simplifying the process such bills are read out at the end of business without debate and pass to the next stage if no mp present verbally objects if there is an objection the bill has to be presented again the government has indicated it will find time from its own commons timetable to get the bill passed the communities secretary james brokenshire said chopes actions were really shocking on such a serious issue he told bbc ones andrew marr show it is hugely disappointing that this bill is not able to proceed that is why we are now looking urgently to get government time for legislation to make this happen obviously sir christophers own association is investigating this i think thats the best place for this to be dealt with chope has argued that even if he backs the intent of such bills he objects to them because he does not support the procedural principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading as commons officials read out a series of bills on friday afternoon chope and fellow backbencher peter bone objected to a series of them including another proposed by goldsmith to help the finances of kew gardens after he was criticised by ministers including truss and the home secretary sajid javid chope told the telegraph it is a pity they are indulging in virtuesignalling rather than looking at the substance he added my constituents know what i am doing we are having letters saying what is parliamentary democracy all about i object to bills going

demands for conservative mp christopher chope to be kicked out of the party were mounting last night as colleagues and campaigners voiced their anger over his move to block a law protecting girls from female genital mutilation fgm chope who gained infamy after previously halting a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence blocked a planned law protecting children from fgm by shouting object when the bill was presented on friday to the commons for its second reading nimco ali the cofounder of the antifgm charity daughters of eve told the observer that chope should be ousted from the party and have the whip removed in the meantime senior cabinet ministers are saying what hes done is completely unacceptable his local conservative association is fed up with him he should have the whip removed and be deselected and if they the conservatives have a vote of no confidence over him then id be more than happy to come and speak ali added that it was important for the integrity of the tory party that it acted decisively if the party wants to move forward and get the progressive vote specifically of black african voters it needs to be in line with this elsewhere senior tories came forward to express their anger over chopes behaviour the home secretary sajid javid said he was very disappointed by the mps move to block the legislation colleague zac goldsmith who cosponsored the bill said chopes actions were appalling and tweeted please note that once again he did not object to those bills put forward by his friends another tory mp anna soubry said that chope must be forced from the party to ensure the integrity of parliament she tweeted if theres any mp that needs deselectingunseating then it must be christopherchope despite chopes actions ali said she was confident the move to increase legal protection to girls would eventually become law fgm could be seen as an obscure issue led by me a black former child refugee a young girl going against somebody like chope who is essentially part of the establishment but it shows that if you are on the right side of history the right side of humanity the good will always win out fridays commons debate would have allowed the courts to make interim care orders under the children act in cases where children are believed to be at risk of fgm the bill had already passed through the house of lords yet parliamentary rules

the conservative mp christopher chope who gained notoriety after he blocked a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence has used the same parliamentary tactic to halt a planned law making it easier to protect girls from female genital mutilation fgm the tory backbencher shouted object when the bill was presented to the commons for its second reading under commons procedure a series of such bills are read out at the end of business without debate and pass to the next stage only if no mp present verbally objects if they do the bill has to be presented again for second reading in this case on march the amendment codrafted by the conservative mp zac goldsmith and crossbench peer michael berkeley does not have government support meaning it will struggle to find parliamentary time chope has obstructed a series of bills in this way including a bill to allow a womens conference to be held in the commons the christchurch mp argues that even if he backs the intent of such bills he objects to them because he does not support the procedural principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading as commons officials read out a series of bills on friday afternoon chope and fellow backbencher peter bone objected to a series of them including another proposed by goldsmith to help the finances of kew gardens chope did not object to two private members bills proposed by bone although other mps did the fgm proposal called the children act amendment female genital mutilation bill is intended to improve the law that prohibited the practice by allowing family courts to make interim care orders about children deemed at risk simplifying the process goldsmith called chopes decision to object appalling in another tweet he said in case anyone is tempted to believe he has a principled objection to private members bills please note that once again he did not object to those put forward by his friends the home secretary sajid javid tweeted that he was very disappointed by the outcome chopes actions had been expected earlier on friday the huffington post printed a text message exchange between the mp and nimco ali the founder of the antifgm charity daughters of eve in which she said she begged him to not do it chope told her he believed the bill should be fully debated at second reading amid a furore following his objection to ban a law to make upskirting a specific criminal offence chope told his local newspaper he was a bit sore about being scapegoated over this he told the bournemouth echo the suggestion that i am some kind of pervert is a complete

maternity leave as all mothers know is not leave from anything except life as you once knew it the job of looking after a baby fulltime for up to a year for those women who can afford it can be joyous lonely stressful inane refreshingly mundane brainless hilarious bodyandsouldestroying the best thing you have ever done and crushingly boring often at the same time every mothers response to this bewildering byzantine system will be different for some the weeks of statutory maternity pay which can be divided into shared parental leave but mostly isnt because its a completely unworkable policy that even the minister promoting it couldnt take up is too long and the desperation to return to work increases exponentially with each spiritbreaking viewing of bing on cbeebies for others the end of maternity leave looms like a beckettian nightmare in which your baby is wrenched from your arms and you are expected to act like the whole lifechanging thing never happened while quietly spending all your earnings on childcare these are the choices and they are part of the reason why mothers of young children are up to more stressed than everyone else while a generation of women say they cannot afford children at all as the divorce lawyer ayesha vardag who has just given birth to her fourth child put it in an interview its like maternity rules have been set up by men in the s you should be with your baby all of the time and if youre coming back you better come back fulltime or were not interested the problems escalate when women return to work if a job still exists one report found maternity leave discrimination leads to women losing their jobs each year and we now know nondisclosure agreements have been used to silence women sacked after having children of those working mothers who keep their jobs threequarters say they have experienced discrimination in the workplace the motherhood penalty in other words is the rule rather than the exception vardags solution is to invite women to return to her law firm as soon as they feel ready for as much time as they want even if that is half a day a week she is open to employees breastfeeding in the office and offers a nanny

equal pay requires honest discussions the gender pay gap as every rightthinking person knows is a feminist myth those figures youve seen about white women earning around of what white men make and black women earning just are probably wrong and if theyre not then as many conservatives have pointed out there are rational explanations for the disparity such as the fact that as jordan peterson has explained women are just more agreeable than men meaning they dont ask for more money which is a very agreeable explanation if you dont want to confront structural inequality while many on the right insist the gender pay gap doesnt exist they also appear keen to block legislation that would strengthen equal pay protection and make it easier for employees to share wage information which would appear to be a contradictory position as congresswoman alexandria ocasiocortez tweeted on wednesday if the wage gap is a myth as some allege then workplaces should have no problem with workers disclosing our salaries with one another ocasiocortezs tweet followed a news conference in which she along with other democrats reintroduced the paycheck fairness act which strives to close the gender wage gap by giving women tools to challenge unequal pay for example it would stop employers retaliating against workers who discuss their salaries with each other the bill was first introduced in but has been repeatedly blocked by republicans while the pay gap has narrowed since not much progress has been made in the last years arguably one reason for this is the lack of transparency around pay most of us dont know how much our colleagues make which makes it easier for companies to ignore the issue indeed lean ins black womens equal pay survey found that of americans arent aware of pay gap between black and white women and hiring managers are also ignorant of the disparity talking about how much you make can be difficult but it is important theres a lot of power in being transparent about your income and working together with your colleagues to ensure everyone is treated fairly last year for example the actress octavia spencer revealed that jessica chastain helped her get five times her salary on a project after realizing that women of colour make far less than white women spencer also recently told an audience at the sundance film festival that lebron james had intervened to get her more pay for her role in a new netflix series i have to say when i was negotiating my deal for madam cj lebron james had to intervene she said we need all our male counterparts to be in the

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday lord give me the confidence of a mediocre white man specifically i wouldnt mind the confidence of beto orourke a dude so assured of his inner greatness that after losing a senate bid he decided the next logical step would be to run for president not only did he lose by the way he lost to ted cruz a man so unlikable theres even a conspiracy theory floating around that hes the zodiac killer now dont get me wrong i dont think losing one election disqualifies someone from jumping into the presidential nominations stacey abrams has said is definitely on the table and id be behind her running then again abrams didnt really lose the georgia gubernatorial contest she had the election stolen from her because of voter suppression tactics no its not betos loss last year that bothers me its his entitlement his certainty that hes qualified for the most powerful job in the world despite his lack of experience his belief that he is qualified for the role despite the fact that he himself has absolutely no idea what he stands for i dont know where i am on a political spectrum and i almost could care less beto recently boasted during a stop in wisconsin ill tell you where beto is on the political spectrum hes wherever its most convenient for him to be he announced his presidential bid by talking about the environment but his sixyear record in congress shows him to be a friend of the fossil fuel industry his voting record is characterized by flipflopping and he is vague about his position on healthcare and raising taxes the only strong conviction he really seems to have is that he deserves to be president man im just born to be in it he recently enthused to vanity fair in many senses beto is right he was born to be successful he is after all a rich kid from a wellconnected family his dad pat orourke was a county judge and got yearold beto who had no interest in politics at the time an internship with the west texas congressman ron coleman like many privileged people beto seems to have confused his luck for godgiven talent a talent so spectacular that he doesnt need to do the hard work mere mortals do i dont ever prepare a speech he boasted to vanity fair can you imagine a woman boasting about how she never prepares no because women know they need to be overprepared just to get a foot in the door ultimately what might be most frustrating about beto is that we all know someone like him hes the guy in the meeting who hasnt done any of the work but who repeats a womans points and immediately gets a round of applause and a promotion hes the guy who pays eloquent lip service to the importance of diversity but would never go so far as conceding a woman might be better qualified for a job than him hes the epitome of mediocre white male confidence and if there is one thing america does not need at the moment its more mediocre white guys running things iranian lawyer sentenced to years and lashes nasrin sotoudeh a renowned human rights lawyer has been jailed for years and given lashes her husband claimed this week sotoudeh was arrested last june after

nearly mps have written to the home secretary sajid javid urging him to act over proposed legislation that would relax restrictive rules for reuniting refugees with their families current immigration rules only allow adult refugees to apply for their married or civil partners and dependent children under to join them they are unable to submit applications for their parents grandparents siblings or children over children who are in the uk alone and have refugee status do not have the right to be reunited with even their closest family members the refugee family reunion bill a private members

justice committee bob neill have written to javid calling on him to prevent further delays the letter reads almost a year ago mps from across the political spectrum united behind a common cause as they overwhelmingly voted to introduce a law that would help reunite refugee families the current rules condemn child refugees fleeing conflict and persecution to live in the uk without their parents it also prevents parents from bringing their children over the age of at a time when refugees need their families the most they are being forced to be without them indefinitely they say a week is a long time in politics but a year is a long time to wait for refugee families it means a year of missed birthdays christmases mothers days fathers days and eids we cannot let the urgent crowd out the important we urge you to use your power to stop the delays on this bill and allow it the necessary time to proceed and be debated with your help we can bring families together campaigners say the government has deliberately delayed the passing of a money resolution a requirement if a new bill proposes spending public funds on something not previously authorised by an act of parliament money resolutions are normally put to the commons for agreement immediately after the bill has passed its second reading but this has not happened macneils bill would broaden the definition of a family

members bill closely and will continue our productive discussions with partners on this complex and sensitive issue we have always been clear that we support the principle of family unity and have

last month the remarkable documentary abused by my girlfriend showed bbc viewers the depths of suffering that can be experienced by male victims of intimate violence alex skeel was beaten tortured and psychologically abused so severely that when police finally intervened he was described by doctors as being just days from death last year his partner jordan worth became the first woman to be convicted of coercive control domestic abuse and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison when he was finally rescued after years of torment skeel was only presumably he didnt know it at the time but everyone involved in the case from police who declined to act when called because they failed to recognise a young man could be a victim of abuse to the prosecutors who finally secured a conviction to the charities which supported skeel and helped him put his life back together operates under one overarching crossgovernment policy the strategy on ending violence against women and girls you should notice a paradox there it is one that has vexed distressed and offended male survivors of sexual and domestic abuse for many years at government level at least the estimated one in six males who are survivors of sexual abuse the annual male victims of domestic abuse the male survivors of stalking honour crimes trafficking or commercial sexual exploitation all are afterthoughts incidental appendices to the suffering of others at least that was the case until last week in a gamechanging development the home office has published its firstever position statement on male victims of crimes within the context of the strategy on ending violence against women and girls vawg its an impressive and important document first and foremost it commits to more than a million pounds worth of muchneeded ringfenced support for charities working with different groups of male victims including gay bisexual and trans men but perhaps more important than the funding is the recognition that male survivors face unique challenges due to their conditioning and the constraints expectations and impositions of our gendered society there are a dozen specific commitments including a promise to ensure that awareness campaigns on issues such as domestic and sexual abuse are gender inclusive and do not exclude male victims and to look again at the commissioning of survivor support work to address chronic gaps in service provision these are huge leaps forward for the men and boys affected and testify to the efforts of campaigners from charities such as survivors manchester and the mankind initiative which have been tireless in banging on the doors of whitehall particular credit goes to their service users survivors who courageously met the challenge of recounting their experiences of abuse and its aftermath in a context where such stories had rarely if ever been heard for all that the biggest political struggle is still to be won the longterm goal for the survivors sector is to extricate men and boys from the vawg strategy altogether the womens sector has done immense work over the decades in highlighting analysing and addressing mens violence against women developing theoretical and practical frameworks under which they can support women and campaign to eradicate abuse it is right and proper that female survivors their organisations and advocates are at the forefront of these efforts it is now long past time that male survivors their representatives and advocates are afforded the same dignity a crossgovernment strategy ending intimate violence against men and boys separate but parallel to that aimed at violence against women and girls would allow male victims survivors and their advocates to secure funding without being pressed into a damaging competition with the womens sector it would allow the men affected to campaign for the political and social changes required within theoretical frameworks that accurately describe their experiences of abuse and recovery while recognising that those experiences and needs are equivalent but different to those of women above all it would give male survivors the basic right to name and identify their experiences on terms of their own choosing not wrestle with those imposed upon them in one last grim violation of their consent ally fogg is a writer and journalist based in manchester

victims of domestic abuse face the choice of their families being plunged into homelessness and poverty or staying with the abuser a report has found more than twothirds of survivors of domestic abuse have reported their partners withheld money from them as a key method of controlling and mistreating them according to the womens aid report the economics of abuse fear of the financial implications kept me in the relationship for much longer than i would have if i had been financially independent one survivor told researchers another said i had to live on thin air when i left with my child this caused much stress and i dont think i have ever recovered nearly half the women said they did not have enough money to pay for basic essentials such as food and bills while they were with their abusive partner more than two in five women were in debt as a result of the economic abuse while a third of women had to give up their home either as a result of experiencing economic abuse or leaving their abusive partner sarah davidge a research evaluation and development officer at womens aid and coauthor of the report said economic abuse is a devastating form of abuse that often has longlasting consequences for survivors published in the runup to international womens day the survey of domestic abuse survivors in england found that economic abuse put significant barriers for them to leave their abuser with survivors facing financial hardship or homelessness after fleeing almost a third of women who left their abusive partner had to turn to credit to do so many others relied on the help of family members or friends while one in five respondents who had left their abuser reported that they had difficulty accessing benefits when you have no access to money you can feel completely trapped said davidge economic abuse is often used by abusers to control their partner and stop her from leaving the governments commitment to including economic abuse in the statutory definition of domestic abuse in its forthcoming domestic abuse bill is very welcome by naming economic abuse we can take the first step to challenging it but what is clear from our survivors voices survey is that women need both access to resources and specialist support to help them escape the longlasting damaging impact of domestic abuse the report found that survivors wer often forced to flee without their belongings it also found that economic abuse not only restricted womens access to money but also had an adverse impact on their employment and education nearly one in five women were prevented by their abusive partner from having paid employment while a third reported that their partner was abusive towards them while they were at work or college making it difficult for them to keep their job or complete their studies,2019-03,victim domestic abuse face choice family plunged homelessness poverty staying abuser report ha found twothirds survivor domestic abuse reported partner withheld money

fresh rallying calls for greater equality and support for mothers in the workplace are made in two recent books heading home motherhood work and the failed promise of equality and making motherhood work how women manage careers and caregiving in the latter the sociologist caitlyn collins casts her net wide to explore how work and family tensions are exacerbated by both a longhours culture and what she sees as societys dismissive attitudes towards caregiving stressed exhausted and unappreciated mothers in italy and the us share anecdotes that contrast markedly with those of their swedish counterparts in sweden more progressive social policies mean that fathers take days of paternity leave and play a bigger role in childcare bringing the nirvana of worklife balance closer to reality this approach collins argues should be more widely embraced no one would quibble with these sentiments or the battle cry for business to take more responsibility for its employees yet this is all familiar territory in a debate that could be greatly enriched by a new perspective what about childfree workers are they not just as disadvantaged by regressive working policies or indeed any less immune to the trivialisation of their lifestyle choices and office double standards the answer is yes and i speak from experience one that over the years has flared up with particular force whenever i have wanted to work more flexibly indeed the seemingly simple request to work from home occasionally has at times been a torturous and demeaning exercise that has revealed the widely held assumption that without kids theres little life to balance what do you want flexible working for anyway asked one boss incredulously unable to fathom my motives the inflexion didnt go unnoticed actually at the time with stressinduced insomnia any reprieve from the longhours office culture would have been transformative for both my wellbeing and productivity yet even after sharing the most personal of medical information my request was denied i remained in situ heart pounding and head spinning and this was far from an isolated incident ive worked in newsrooms for global charities as part of a fourstrong agency team and even in a failing school yet for all the different quirks cultures and formalities keeping me tethered to the desk has been the common dominator youre ok manning the fort arent you caroline my editor would asktell me not really waiting for a reply and sealing my fate to work yet another easter week the expectation that i would be available to attend evening and weekend events often arising from lastminute requests came with the matteroffact assumption that i had no other commitments the leeway given to working parents is an understandable and accepted convention but whether this courtesy is extended to all employees too often hinges on the whim of a manager this discrepancy ignores the many other valid reasons why workers should be cut a little slack beyond childcare notably dependants come in different forms be that a sick relative a beloved pet or ageing parent then there are mentalhealth issues which being unpredictable and sometimes debilitating pose a challenge to the rigidity of corporate life this sense that your concerns and wellbeing are under the radar is echoed by a broader invisibility in the cultural narrative yet childless workers do need to be part of the conversation while discrepancies and inconsistencies prevail where one persons flexible working comes at the expense of another picking up the slack where peoples needs are pitted against each other in a warped battle to be most deserving we will still have divisions and toxicity that ultimately benefit no one indeed if the approach to flexible working had been less selective from the outset we might by now be further down the line in seeing the officebound nine to five for the anachronism it undoubtedly is and all be much closer to something far more progressive the occasions i have been able to work flexibly have been hugely beneficial to my mental wellbeing giving me a psychological boost simply by having more control over my agenda and life the opportunity to exercise at more convenient times to be outside getting the endorphins flowing has had a hugely positive effect on my mood in a way that being holed up in an office for eight hours with its

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday the rise of menstrual surveillance why digital privacy is a feminist issue your vagina has been digitized so have your ovaries so has your period over the last few years there has been an explosion in femtech digital tools and services centered around womens health there are positive aspects to this but theres also a dark side including the rise of what has been called menstrual surveillance corporations are increasingly aware that female bodies are temples of lucrative information and are exploiting this data in new and evermoredystopian ways take ovia health a collection of familyplanning apps for example according to a recent report by the washington post ovia has become a powerful monitoring tool for employers and health insurers which under the banner of corporate wellness have aggressively pushed to gather more data about their workers lives that data includes intimate information about your fertility your menstrual cycle and the progression of your pregnancy activision blizzard a video game company is one of various employers encouraging its workers to use ovias tracking services the information collected by the apps is then shared with the company allowing it to see how many of its employees are pregnant trying to get pregnant or facing highrisk pregnancies activision blizzard has been experimenting with employee monitoring technology for a while in it incentivized employees to use fitbits the video game companys vicepresident of global benefits proudly told the post each time we introduced something there was a bit of an outcry youre prying into our lives but we slowly increased the sensitivity of stuff and eventually people understood its all voluntary theres no gun to your head and were going to reward you if you choose to do it ah yes i forgot to mention the rewards activision blizzard pays employees a princely a day to use ovia its disingenuous for employers to describe tracking initiatives like this as voluntary if theyre strongly encouraging people to use them its also disingenuous to claim as ovia does that you dont need to worry about privacy issues because all the data provided to employers is aggregated and anonymized theres plenty of evidence that anonymized data can easily be crossreferenced with other data and traced back to the source it is wellestablished that companies discriminate against pregnant employees the implications of this sort of menstrual and pregnancy monitoring are terrifying particularly as rachel dubrofsky coeditor of the book feminist surveillance studies told me over email in a climate where antiabortion zealots are trying to remove all reproductive rights from women in america for instance the recent attempt by texas legislators to make abortion a capital offense punishable by death and the ohio heartbeat bill outlawing abortion once a heartbeat can be detected given this climate dubrofsky notes apps such as ovia are particularly concerning for their potential to further restrict the rights of women to have control over their bodies make womens access to affordable healthcare increasingly precarious and put womens jobs at risk upskirting criminalized in english law taking a photo of someones underwear or genitals buttock or genitals without their consent is now a crime in england and wales punishable by up to two years in prison the new legislation is largely thanks to gina martin who was a victim of upskirting at a music festival in martin reported the incident to the police but discovered that it wasnt an offence under english law she quickly started a campaign to change that while martin is thrilled with the new law she points out that more needs to be done to raise awareness of the issue if a new laws there great but if we dont know about it or arent reporting it then it doesnt do anything she told bbc news we have to build a picture of how much this happens because it happens a lot the consent condom stupidest idea of the week goes to something called the consent pack of condoms designed by an argentinian ad agency as a marketing gimmick for tulipan which makes sex toys and contraceptives it takes four hands to open this condom which is supposed to illustrate the importance of consent as journalist holly baxter noted on twitter the worrying thing is that this frames consent as a discussion and implies that the real issue is that women might make it upexaggerate after consensual sex this is a product designed essentially to protect men from rape accusations not to protect women from rape more than four in women fear refusing partners sexual demands speaking of consent a new study by the uns sexual and reproductive health

against expert advice the government has created a million grants program to deliver services to people mostly women being violently abused by their intimate partners the conditions of the grant actually state that it is to deliver a whole of family approach incorporating counselling dispute resolution and education for violent or abusive individuals whole of family includes both the person being abused and the person abusing them when this was announced a close friend shared her experience in her mids she told her husband she was leaving it was the second time she had tried after her husband had refused to accept it this time he offered a noncompromise that they would try marriage counselling first and if it didnt help she would be allowed to go the counsellor appointed by the church saw the couple in her home each week she was made to justify why she wanted to leave while her husband sat less than arms reach away she said she felt belittled undermined her resilience waned they had a small child didnt she want to keep the family together the overwhelming barriers just grew and grew she told me she didnt know how she gathered the strength to leave but she did she lost her house her job and family members she had loved and trusted leaving in the face of abuse already feels impossible the actu says leaving a violent relationship takes on average and hours most women leaving a family violence situation move out of their home meaning they have to find accommodation elsewhere in women sought homelessness services because of family violence almost of women continue to experience violence from their partner while theyre separated the period immediately after leaving is the most dangerous there is a moment standing on the precipice when a woman wonders if she will ever be safe again this diabolical grant financially supports ongoing harm to women and children in encouraging women to stay in the home the government exposes them to even higher risk than before it prolongs the abuse while giving the abuser more fuel for their violent behaviour the organisations providing the services wont even be required to have experience delivering domestic violence services it seems too obvious to even mention but assaulting someone is a crime intimate partner violence causes more disability illness and deaths than any other risk factor for women aged the heinous act of physical or emotional violence towards another person is not diminished because it happens within a relationship we dont suggest attempted murderers should reach a compromise with their victim we dont ask a guy whos been coward punched to hear the other guys story this desire for women to reason with their abusers exists in all kinds of relationships from intimate partners to teachers and random dudes on the street this is the basis of boys will be boys and myths about losing control and the idea that men just develop slower emotionally bless em women should mother nourish incubate if we fail to do that well who do we have to blame but ourselves lets not forget the government has tried this before as social services minister morrison was forced to scrap kevin andrews stronger relationships trial a subsidy for marriage counselling because of low enrolment numbers women dont need marriage counselling they need emergency housing womens refuges basic essentials for starting over protection in their homes and law enforcement that takes abuse seriously there is enormous value in counselling for women looking for guidance a professional can offer insights techniques for coping and strategies for taking the next steps out of an abusive relationship but what the government really has is a paternalistic churchdriven attitude towards family violence protect conservative family values keep women in the home where they belong teach them how to be subservient love honour obey to put atrisk women in situations designed to manipulate power imbalances and personal strength is to sign their death certificates the perceived sanctity of marriage cannot take precedence over safety keeping mum and dad and definitely not any other combination in morrisons opinion together cannot be the driving force behind domestic violence initiatives pressuring women to stay in their homes will kill women it will kill them it will kill us anna spargoryan is the melbourne based author of the

knowing that there is a gender pay gap is one thing shrinking it is something else when the uk government introduced compulsory reporting of the difference between mens and womens pay by companies employing more than people the hope was that publishing the data would lead to action announcing what he called a really big move in then prime minister david cameron promised it would create the pressure we need for change driving womens wages up since last years figures were the first set creating a baseline from which to measure progress this week was the first opportunity to check for changes the upshot is that the gender pay gap at these workplaces shrank by a tenth of a percentage point between and from to while the governments stated aim was to eradicate the gap within a generation at this rate it will take almost a century forcing employers to be transparent was a good idea and these numbers are important if you dont know what is going on you cant challenge it either from within or outside organisations but if the idea was to name and shame the worst offenders and provide employees with a tool with which to chip away at unfairness things have not got off to a good start while some companies are taking a proactive approach for example by overhauling recruitment processes and pay structures more action is needed it is not tenable for politicians to insist that such apparent injustices are highlighted only to then sit back and expect the problems to sort themselves out employers must be compelled to explain why male employees are paid more and what they are doing to even things out this requirement is all the more urgent in the broader context for womens rights and gender inequality last month on international womens day the equalities minister penny mordaunt admitted that in many respects we are actually going backwards widening economic inequality is a major aspect of this public sector cuts have disproportionately affected women overrepresented among disadvantaged groups including pensioners and single parents as theresa may then in charge of the equalities portfolio warned that they would in a letter to the then chancellor george osborne in the gender pay data does not cover those who face even greater hardships female pensioners workingage benefit claimants and workers in temporary and insecure roles but its role in highlighting

feeling paralysed in feelings of futility when she learned that she had been paid less than for film reshoots for which her costar mark wahlberg was paid m in the uk bbc journalist carrie gracie resigned in protest from her role as china editor when she discovered how much less she was being paid than male peers such examples can be galvanising and brave individuals can make a difference both these cases led to actions by men mr wahlberg donated his salary several male bbc staff accepted pay cuts as well as increases for women men dominate the most senior and highestpaid roles in all sectors partners in law and accountancy firms should be brought into the scope of gender pay rules straight away and reporting of ratios between the highest and lowestpaid made mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap reporting should be introduced and the equality and human rights commission given stronger powers to enforce and investigate and the resources to use them both conscious and unwitting discrimination by bosses is one reason for disparities in pay but there are structural reasons why women are overrepresented in lowerpaid and parttime jobs which only policymakers can fix if unpaid caring work including parenting could over time be more evenly distributed between men and women and personal life better balanced with paid work it would benefit us all,2019-04,knowing gender

wouldnt it be neat if we could put a number on gender inequality if we could quantitatively measure the challenge women face every day to be treated on a par with their male counterparts financially socially and culturally then we could track precise progress numerically and hold ourselves accountable undeniably because statistics are great like that they dont lie and they dont tell half truths except unfortunately when they do welcome to the second round of uk gender pay gap reporting as of last year april will be the annual deadline for any british business or charity employing at least people to report the mean and median gender pay gaps across their organisation as well as the bonus pay gap the number of men and women receiving a bonus and a breakdown of the proportion of men and women in each compensation quartile to approximately no ones surprise last years figures made for grim reading companies pay their average female worker about less than they pay their average male worker to be clear this is not a discrimination issue and its not necessarily an indication of anyone breaking the law but that doesnt make it ok it just means that women chronically tend to occupy lowerpaying jobs than men do that theyre more likely to drop out of the workforce to take on unpaid domestic caring duties and that for whatever reason theyre much less likely to reach the highest earning echelons of corporate britain the first round of paygap reporting rightly caused many companies to pull their socks up so we should obviously be wary of those who post a greater pay gap this year than they did last but its even more important to be wary of the gaps that got smaller we live in a world where throwing money at problems makes them go away think of settlements or charitable donations made to banish the aftertaste of ethically questionable behaviour in the most perverse cases nondisclosure agreements carry a comparatively small price tag for silencing the bullied and abused and letting the offender off scotfree the buck should stop when it comes to gender pay gaps we cant let companies buy themselves out of a sticky situation without addressing the underlying problem and the part they are playing in it it would be like trying to get rid of dry rot by plastering over it at best it will continue festering at worst it will thrive and spread instead we have to admit and accept that we might have to make it look worse before it fundamentally gets better of all the companies reporting their pay gaps the ones i most respect are those reporting an increase purely fuelled by hiring junior level women with the intention of fostering that talent up the spectrum of seniority its those companies that are wholeheartedly investing in the future and committing to deeprooted cultural change the only type of change thats truly sustainable if they can nail the retention challenge then theyre really on to something on the flipside the ones i have least respect for are those treating this like a dirty game of fudgethefacts to make themselves look good unfortunately there are plenty preliminary figures show that while the uks overall gender pay gap might have narrowed marginally the bonus gap has jumped at over of companies by some estimates id be curious to see the correlation between the businesses with the greatest increase in bonus pay gap and the largest decrease in base salary pay gap id be willing to bet at least a few pennies that there is one reporting your gender pay gap shouldnt be an exercise in public relations management it shouldnt be an incentive for businesses to give indiscriminate salary rises to hordes of women just to achieve favourable optics it also shouldnt be a nameandshame parade or an excuse to humiliate corporate management and hr departments instead it should create transparency to fuel progress in time the stats will offer a gauge of the success of our sometimes halfhearted sometimes fully realised efforts

mothers take of the primary carers leave in australia and a lack of legislated shared parental leave traditional gender roles and the gender pay gap are all working to prevent fathers from taking on the role a report published on tuesday says an analysis of australian bureau of statistics employment and timeuse data found that the birth of a child had little impact on the employment of fathers just one in fathers took primary parental leave a low proportion by global standards this trend was seen most clearly when comparing timeuse data for mothers and fathers and contrasting this with their timeuse in the year before they had their first child the number of hours fathers spend in employment remains at the same level before and after having children the report found fathers do spend time on parenting and childcare when they have young children fitting this time around their hours of employment the analysis was conducted by the australian institute of family studies the institutes senior research fellow dr jennifer baxter said mothers tended to be the primary carers of children under one and fathers were more likely to become primary carers as children became older what we often see when we are talking to families in research is that there is an assumption that the baby will come and the mother will take time off baxter said for some mums its a life desire but for others its a struggle to make it work theres such a great diversity in views and wishes around these decisions and what we think is there isnt enough of a discussion between mothers and fathers to explore all of the options in an article published alongside the research parents at work chief executive emma walsh said australia did not have a nationally legislated approach to shared parental leave and as a result fathers were often automatically labelled as secondary carers most employers provide limited parental leave for secondary carers if any at all walsh said this divide is reinforced by entrenched social views of the breadwinner and homemaker gender ideals fathers are conscious of a stigma and bias around taking extended leave especially when they are unable to see many of their male colleagues taking leave this was despite extensive research that had demonstrated the benefits of fathers taking parental leave including more equal distribution of unpaid care work a better balance between work and family for both parents and more opportunities for mothers to pursue their career with flexibility and purpose walsh said economically shared parental leave is unequivocally good for business the retention of talent and lower rates of staff turnover resulting in lower recruitment and training costs is a key reason some employers provide paid family leave barbara pocock an emeritus professor with university of south australias business school has spent more than years researching industrial relations inequality work and family and pay equity she described the findings from the analysis as unsurprising the public sector is still a very different and more flexible place in general than private companies and thats why so many women turn to work in health and education pocock said there are also pockets in large private companies and small businesses where a combination of factors like a really good boss having highlyvalued skills and being in a highlyprofitable industry make it more likely that both women and men will be able to take more flexible parental leave arrangements she said of workers also had some kind of caring responsibility whether it be for parents or children all of that shock absorbing or most of it is done by women and it shows up in all data about who feels the most stressed and time poor she said lots of people navigate towards holding it all together which protects them from a fronton confrontation with the working cultures and ideas that are dominant it is also true that a lot of men find being at home with children much more demanding than they expected,2019-05,mother take primary carers leave australia lack legislated shared parental leave traditional gender role gender pay gap

tips for seducing women by ignoring them when they say no from the comfort of his mothers basement roosh has spent the last decade publishing vile posts like reasons to date a girl with an eating disorder the intellectual inferiority of women and street harassment is a myth invented by socially retarded white women hes organized fatshaming campaigns and once notoriously suggested rape should be legal on private property because then women would be more careful about who they went home with he later claimed this was satire hes a douchebag but more dangerously hes an influential douchebag hordes of angry young men listen to him so has roosh now changed his ways will he be preaching peace consensual love and feminism to his angry acolytes thats probably far too much to hope but one can be cautiously optimistic that he has had a positive change of perspective in a recent post on his forum he writes that the god pill does feel like the final destination where life becomes about asking him for help and performing his will in a way that embraces good my mind is currently buzzing with this new perspective and i wouldnt be surprised if much of my new work will be framed around it can

mps who have mental health problems are left to suffer in silence because of an absence of proper support services and a lack of trust in party whips a major report to be published in the british medical journal will say this week the study carried out by researchers at the institute of psychiatry part of kings college london is expected to find that mps often feel they have no one to turn to if they struggle with mental health issues because parliament lags behind most modern workplaces in the services it offers the report is the result of the first formal research project into the mental health and wellbeing of mps one of those involved was the conservative mp dr dan poulter who is also an nhs psychiatrist many mps have spoken publicly about the pressure and anxieties that can arise from serving both constituents and their party on difficult and divisive issues such as brexit while being constantly in the public eye the report is expected to raise a number of issues about mps lack of awareness about the support services that are available to them and that have been introduced over recent years and the practical problems they face in a workplace run on often archaic rules and traditions in particular it is expected to raise concerns that they do not feel able to discuss their mental health and wellbeing with party whips whose key role is as enforcers of party discipline if an mp wants to be absent from a vote because of health or other issues he or she would have to inform the whips of the reasons the whip also keeps files on each mp about their loyalty and voting record which are used to judge who is thought suitable for promotion when ministerial or shadow ministerial reshuffles occur the researchers conducted questionnaires with mps of all parties and found that many believed that the lack of adequate services often prevented them doing their job as well as they should the report is likely to raise new concerns about the outdated workings of parliament following recent scandals over sexual harassment of parliamentary staff which led to urgent investigations and changes in complaints procedures speaking in in a debate on mental health several mps gave emotional accounts of their own experiences former labour minister kevan jones told colleagues like a lot of men you try and deal with it yourself you dont talk to people first of all it creeps up on you very slowly i think in politics we are designed to think somehow that if you admit fault or frailty you are going to be looked on in a disparaging way both by the electorate but also by your peers as well we have got to talk about mental health in this house actually admitting that sometimes you need help is not a sign of weakness both andrea leadsom the conservative former

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday the world is not yet ready for deepnude want to see taylor swift naked theres an app for that its called deepnude and it uses ai to undress photos of women and produce a realistic nude image or rather there was an app for that the creators of the horrifying program took it down on thursday after a vice article about deepnude catalyzed widespread outrage we created this project for users entertainment a few months ago the apps creators tweeted we never thought it would become viral and we would not be able to control the traffic despite the safety measures adopted watermarks if people use it the probability that people will misuse it is too high the world is not yet ready for deepnude the world certainly isnt ready for deepnude but wed better start getting ready one creator may have had a crisis of conscience and taken his program offline but apps like this are going to continue to pop up and they will only grow more sophisticated not to mention deepnude is far from the only program that lets you create realistic fake nudes plenty of women are already being digitally inserted into porn photos or videos without their consent a problem were not talking about nearly enough the harm done to women when it comes to this kind of sexual objectification is happening now mary anne franks president of the cyber civil rights initiative told the huffington post earlier this year its almost like people have forgotten that this is what this technology really started out as and the conversation around women has fallen away in recent months theres been increasing concern about deepfake technology which allows people to produce realisticseeming photos or video content but as franks noted a lot of this discussion has revolved around the implications for politicians and powerful people it ignores the fact that the motivation behind a lot of this tech is to control and humiliate women deepnude for example didnt let you undress dudes the app was specifically focused on women when vice tried to use it on a man it apparently replaced his pants with a vulva if you become the victim of a deepfake theres very little you can do our laws simply havent caught up to the technology its also basically impossible to protect yourself from becoming the subject of a deepfake as franks told the huffington post theres nothing you can really do to protect yourself except not exist online the internet can be an incredibly toxic place for women according to amnesty international of american women have experienced threats of physical or sexual violence online amnesty international also found that an abusive or problematic tweet is sent to a woman every seconds on average with black women being more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets social media platforms have done very little curb to their abuse problem leading women to censor themselves online or leave social media altogether the rise of deepfake technology is going to make the internet exponentially more difficult for women unless we start taking online misogyny seriously we are going to face a future where women may not be able to exist online alabama is waging a full on war against women marshae jones a yearold alabama woman was shot in the stomach last year she lost her fivemonthold fetus as a result on wednesday jones was indicted on a manslaughter charge for the death of her unborn baby the investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby a police officer said she had no choice in being brought unnecessarily into a fight where she was relying on her mother for protection meanwhile the shooter went free this case is nothing short of terrifying it treats women as nothing more than walking wombs what next a woman who trips and has a miscarriage gets sent to prison its a very real possibility florida woman arrested for turning in her husbands guns a yearold woman from florida was afraid her husband who had attempted to run her over was going to kill her so she took his guns to the police the police then promptly arrested with her grand theft of a firearm and armed burglary remember when brian stelter told women they were being hysterical for saying america was a few steps away from the handmaids tale guess what brian we werent two women go on record to corroborate trump rape allegations after initially downplaying e jean carrolls account of trump raping her in the s the new york times is now taking it seriously on thursday it spoke to two of carrols friends who corroborated her allegations so yeah just a reminder that the most powerful man in the world has credibly been accused of rape and is seemingly not facing any repercussions could cervical cancer be eradicated some good news scientists believe that the success of the hpv vaccination means theres a chance cervical cancer could be eradicated in the next few decades thats assuming the antivaxxers dont take over the world of course praying for a hot dalai lama in the dalai lama told the bbc that a female dalai lama would have to be good looking or

in march i launched a petition calling on the government to sustainably fund rape support services after i was turned away from multiple rape crisis centres when i really needed help more than people have already signed the petition i have met ministers at no given evidence in parliament and mps have signed an early day motion on the issue but support services remain inaccessible what is the future prime minister going to do about it the crisis centres i approached over a period of eight months had been forced to close their waiting lists due to exceptionally high demand and longterm underfunding for years rape counselling centres have been put in the impossible position of turning women like me away because they know that those who are already on their waiting lists may have to wait as long as months before seeing a specialist counsellor but neither jeremy hunt nor boris johnson seems very forthcoming in addressing this issue this is despite the fact that rape support services are inaccessible despite the fact that the crown prosecution service is facing a judicial review due to a decline in the number of rape cases that have made it to court since despite the fact that only of rape cases reported to police in england and wales are prosecuted and despite the fact that two women a week are killed by a partner or former partner the future prime minister would do well not to forget those women who have been abused ignored and dismissed because our anger drives and unites us we will not stay silent this is not new information both candidates will be aware that rape support services in the local community have been at crisis point for years in fact my mp wrote to jeremy hunt in when i was still unable to get on to a rape crisis waiting list she asked him as the then secretary of state for health what steps his department was taking to provide support to survivors of sexual assault in london where services were oversubscribed his reply allocations for sexual assault referral centres have increased this year he missed the point entirely local community services were and still are oversubscribed which was the reason for the letter in the first place his response illustrated a clear inability to understand that so i want to ask him again as prime minister what steps would he take to provide support to survivors of sexual assault when services are massively oversubscribed then we come to johnson the man who described spending on investigations into child sex abuse as money spaffed up the wall does he have any idea how much pain his grotesque comment caused rape crisis reported an increase of between and of service users aged or under an nspcc report shows that the number of recorded sexual offences against children has been steadily increasing throughout the uk since johnsons comment seems to be in direct contradiction to his comments during a mayor of london question time in in which he said rape is an odious crime and it is something that needs to be taken much more seriously i believe by us as a society well mr johnson now is the opportunity to explain what you will do to ensure all victims of sexual violence can access support though the support i have received since launching my petition has been overwhelming and the signatures are still building the vitriol that survivors of sexual violence face is still fiercely prevalent i have been called a liar i have been shamed and my experiences have been dismissed altogether but what has infuriated me most is the number of times i have had to repeat something so simple i was raped and i couldnt access the support i needed to recover we know thousands of victims have been in the same situation for years because waiting lists have been closed for years that should be the only evidence this government or any hopeful prime minister needs to take urgent action not in five years time now it is sadly unsurprising to me that hansard shows that rape crisis has been spoken of times since whereas brexit has been recorded times but i refuse to accept that the latter is more important than the former i dare anybody to argue otherwise fern champion is a campaigner

footage of a uk government minister mark field forcibly removing a greenpeace activist from a city of london banqueting hall on thursday night is not only extremely damaging to mr field it has a detrimental effect more widely on his party his parliamentary colleagues and politics itself the spectacle of a figure of mr fields seniority behaving in such a gratuitously aggressive manner at an important national occasion has the potential to reverberate far and wide what could have possessed a minister especially one who has talked about helping women feel safe so they can speak freely and be part of the change we all want to grab a female protester shove her against a pillar then grasp her by the back of the neck and push her from the room the degree of force used was shocking such misjudgments are all the more grave at a time when standards and norms of conduct are known to be imperilled and civility in the public square seems increasingly to have been replaced by rancour all politicians have a responsibility to promote high standards in public life it is right that mr field has been suspended from his ministerial role and apologised that so many people including senior conservative mps have rushed to his defence gives cause for alarm this is especially so at the end of a week that also saw the homelessness minister heather wheeler forced to apologise for describing rough sleepers in her south derbyshire constituency in pejorative terms as old tinkers politeness and civility are virtuous this is not to argue for obsequious questioning or unquestioning respect for authority the three years since the uks brexit referendum have revealed and deepened profound divisions of culture and opinion the rise in hate crime effects of austerity and climate emergency all provoke rightly angry responses but beliefs can be strongly expressed without aggression three years ago the mp jo cox was murdered and any mp could be forgiven a jumpy initial reaction when taken by surprise by a member of the public mr fields recent actions went far beyond that and such considerations make them appear all the more reckless by modelling the use of violence in a situation where there was no physical threat he may well have helped to lower the bar for the use of force whatever the outcome of the police and party investigations mr field should now consider whether his future lies in public life meanwhile it would be good if paul crowthers sentencing for a common assault on nigel farage earlier this week drew a line under the recent spate of milkshakethrowing incidents while this might seem a lighthearted way to make a serious point the principle of nonviolent dissent is too valuable to turn into spilt milk the week has been dominated by a conservative leadership contest that has compounded a national mood of disengagement and frustration confidence in our institutions is being tested to its limits at such a time it is more important than ever to respect peoples democratic right to use their voices mr fields decision to overpower an activist rather than listen to her reflects badly on him even more worrying is what it says about the state britain is

mark field whose suspension as a foreign office minister was precipitated by the emergence of video footage showing him manhandling a greenpeace protester who was trying to peacefully draw attention to the climate crisis has often walked a fine line between seeking to protect the right to protest and to curb its effectiveness in a westminster hall debate last month he lauded the work of the foreign office in seeking to protect the rights of female activists across the world and detailed some of the many means used to silence them when the extinction rebellion demonstrations were bringing parts of london to a standstill this year field similarly stood up for the right to protest peacefully when it came to the actual demonstrations taking place however field was more conflicted and went as far as to write to the met police commissioner cressida dick demanding that she take a much firmer grip on those protesting in this antisocial way the demonstrations he said had gone well beyond a goodnatured exercise in free speech field added that the detrimental effect these protests are having on ordinary citizens and local business is much too great for the protesters however well intention to be allowed to carry on in such an flagrant way it is a theme that has been repeated in other comments he has made in similar situations in an interview with channel news in during the occupy london demonstrations outside st pauls cathedral he said he was very proud that we have a tradition in this country of open protest it is very much an important part of democracy the early occupy demonstrations were he said valid asked whether the protest was not therefore still valid he said there is making a protest and there is having a semipermanent encampment there are many rights that londoners have and tourists have to be able to get into the cathedral and to be able to walk in what is the open highway field who has been a member of parliament since and a junior minister

they came wearing red evening dresses and sashes like something from a bygone age of suffragette protests or perhaps that should be suffragists the more peaceful wing of the movement for the climate crisis campaigners who set out to disrupt the chancellors annual mansion house speech to the city had done all they could to look unthreatening knowing that politicians are understandably jumpy about personal security nowadays the protest was femaleled greenpeace explained in the hope of keeping it calm some hope the police are investigating precisely what happened when protester janet barker walked behind the conservative mp mark field apparently heading towards the top table holding the great and good but film of field leaping up and grappling with her before frogmarching her out with a hand around her neck has gone viral for good reason whatever the police investigation concludes it is hard to think of a more toxic image of conservatism than an angrylooking man in black tie manhandling a woman away from a fancy banquet brute male force versus plucky female resistance cosy privileged club versus outsider somewhere she wasnt invited no wonder we cant stop watching and rewatching it it arguably says something about field that of all the diners she passes he is the only one to shove back his chair but the public reaction to what he did speaks volumes too to pick a side in this argument is to place yourself quite clearly on a spectrum running from those who are naturally at ease with conventional authority through to those with good reason to fear it so many women will watch that footage of barker being shoved against a wall and instinctively wince you dont need to have felt the sharp edge of a mans temper to be afraid of it and there is something viscerally disturbing about the sight of a hand closing in on a vulnerable neck if he really thought she was so dangerous why not wrestle her to the ground and if he just wanted to get her out before she caused trouble why not steer her by the elbow as it is the whole thing looks horribly reminiscent of a controlling husband hustling away a wife who has had a few drinks at a party and is now in danger of making a scene while everyone else stares uncomfortably at their shoes but not everyone will see it that way all over the country this morning there will have been millions of tory voters harrumphing that frankly she got what was coming to her that it was her fault for bursting into a private dinner wilfully causing a security scare when she must have known everyone was on edge what happened split the room never mind the country with some guests reportedly horrified at what they saw as an overreaction while others broke into applause after she was removed fields fellow diners have been criticised in some quarters for failing to step in and calm things down but in the heat of the moment it isnt always that simple theresa mays cabinet were mocked for sitting around helplessly when a man who thankfully turned out merely to be a comedian pulling off a stunt suddenly lunged towards the podium during her party conference speech but all i can say having been there at the time is that it takes longer than you think for the brain to catch up with the evidence right in front of your eyes most bystanders natural response is to freeze in profoundly unheroic confusion because they cant quite believe what theyre seeing surely this cant be real but watching the mansion house film back in the cold light of day it is simply impossible not to form a view we know which side may is on at least she rightly suspended field with downing street confirming that she found the footage very concerning jeremy hunt whose leadership bid field was supporting chose to emphasise his colleagues apology while adding that he recognises that what happened was an overreaction but the biggest test of character here is perhaps for boris johnson since those who instinctively sympathise with field are now his natural constituency johnsons path to the leadership in the current climate lies through the sort of tory members grumbling that a man cant even act like a man any more without being vilified for it plus those sick of being preached at by what they see as sanctimonious lefties chipping away at the lifestyles they lead many of them regard hunt as suspiciously wet warming instead to johnsons incorrigible political incorrectness but are these really the followers he wants his reaction over the coming days is a fascinating test of what kind of leader he wants to be at a debate hosted by the policy exchange thinktank last week the strategist lynton crosby widely expected to run johnsons first general election campaign if he becomes leader sketched out how he thought the tories might win again the model is scott morrison the australian politician who confounded pollsters bookies and pundits by winning a surprise reelection victory shortly after assuming the leadership of the governing liberal party morrison had crosby explained pitched himself as the man for quiet australians people who dont follow politics closely arent active on social media and just want to be left to get on with life and won by aligning himself with their gut values the next tory leader should also pitch themselves as being on the side of what the australian prime minister robert menzies famously called the forgotten people better known here as john majors silent majority tony blairs hardworking families and david camerons middle income strivers it may seem an oddly retro approach for the unpredictable times were living through but crosby clearly still believes elections all come down in the end to telling a story of shared broadly socially conservative values and thats why the mansion house incident matters its a perfect litmus test of where people stand on those values deep down are you socially liberal pink or socially conservative blue if the latter do you believe a true gentleman never lifts a hand to a woman or that women cant go around demanding equality and then expecting special treatment are you more afraid of cosy consensus forming behind closed doors or of the chaos unleashed by someone breaking through them all of us know in our guts how wed answer even if we might avoid saying so publicly do not trust the politician who seeks

mark field has been suspended as a foreign office minister after a video showed him pushing a female greenpeace activist against a pillar and grabbing her neck while she protested at the chancellors mansion house speech police are investigating thirdparty reports of assault made against field who has since apologised to the protester the mp for the cities of london and westminster said he had felt threatened when the protester walked past him and was worried she might have been armed downing street said theresa may had viewed the footage of the incident on thursday night and decided to suspend him the activist janet barker said on friday that she was incredulous at his reaction and welcomed the suspension but would not press criminal charges i think it is something best dealt with in the court of opinion she said barker said field had pushed her so hard as they reached the door that she had almost fallen she said he should take anger management classes i want him to think about what he did why he did it and address his behaviour she said she had made no sudden movements or behaved in any way that could have been construed as physically threatening i had a phone and a tiny handbag which was open and full of leaflets she said the only thing i was armed with was peerreviewed science labour challenged the conservatives to suspend field from the party and the whip pending the outcome of the investigation into his behaviour the prime ministers spokeswoman said she found it very concerning the police have said they are looking into reports over this matter he will be suspended as a minister while this investigation takes place mansion house are looking into the breach of security that took place and we believe it is right they are now reviewing their security arrangements may is understood to have spoken to her chief whip julian smith after viewing the footage and smith told field he had been suspended midmorning on friday asked whether conservative mps including peter bottomley and johnny mercer should have been defending field in the media while he was being investigated the spokeswoman repeated that the prime minister had found the footage to be a cause for concern field was a minister in jeremy hunts team at the foreign office and was supporting him in the tory leadership contest hunt told the bbc mark has issued a full and unreserved apology he recognises that what happened was an overreaction philip hammond was preparing to deliver his setpiece address in the city of london when dozens of greenpeace activists interrupted him to give an alternative speech about the climate crisis video footage shows in a statement released in the early hours of friday before his suspension field said he had reacted instinctively he said he grasped the intruder firmly in order to remove her from the room as swiftly as possible i deeply regret this episode and unreservedly apologise to the lady concerned for grabbing her but in the current climate i felt i needed to act decisively to close down the threat to the safety of those present field said he had referred himself to the cabinet office to examine if there has been a breach of the ministerial code and that he would cooperate fully with its investigation guests at the event raised concerns about security because the protesters appeared to have evaded airportstyle checks it seemed to be very difficult to get the security at the venue to do their job once it became clear that something was happening one person who was present complained attendees said they feared a terrorist attack was taking place in the seconds after the activists burst in but quickly realised they were climate protesters the incident involving field is understood to have taken place on the opposite side of the hall from where the majority of protesters were stopped trying to give hammond and the bank of england governor mark carney their alternative speech and distribute leaflets one guest said fields actions had raised eyebrows and left those who saw the incident shocked asked what happened when the protesters entered the hall a financier said people stopped talking and listened politely a lady kept reading the same sentences over and over again but she was very polite we listened for three to four minutes said thank you very much and clapped then they were asked to leave and security took them out they came straight in i dont know how they managed to do it i brought my passport with me for an id check when i arrived but it did not happen but there were security scanners he said some of the male protesters who were wearing black tie appear to have sat down at the dining tables before getting up as a group and leaving to join the female protesters who were wearing distinctive red dresses with a sash saying climate emergency questions were being asked in political circles about whether the chancellor would return to mansion house given the lack of security youve had protests when george osborne has appeared and now this liz truss was there but if she becomes chancellor its not a certainty shell be back to give a speech this time next year a guest said the city of london corporation which organises the dinner said it was investigating the security breach greenpeace did not provide details of how the activists gained entry to mansion house fields situation is complicated by the fact that he has been responsible for the uk governments response to the crisis in hong kong where he called this week for allegations of inappropriate use of force by the hong kong police to be properly investigated questions about his own conduct could make it harder for him to press for restraint in hong kong,2019-06,mark field ha suspended foreign office

what is more shocking that during the chancellor of the exchequers mansion house speech in london at the heart of britains establishment mark field a middleaged male tory minister slammed a young female greenpeace protester against a pillar then forcefully propelled her out clutching her neck that no one at this gilded dinner full of other middleaged besuited bowtiewearing members of the british elite did anything that some even reportedly applauded when he returned that multiple rightwing commentators have not only defended this minister but called for him to be awarded a medal that social media abounds with predominantly men cheering the minister on offering a disturbing and all too revealing insight into what male behaviour towards women they judge to be acceptable fields defence should be treated with derision and contempt he claims that many guests understandably felt threatened and when one protester rushed past me towards the top table i instinctively reacted and that there was no security present and i was for a splitsecond genuinely worried she might have been armed the term gaslighting used to describe psychological abuse in which the victim is made to doubt their recollection of events and even sanity is often abused in political debate but here surely is a prima facie case mr field we can see the video no one appears threatened by a young greenpeace activist in a red dress and a friend of the itv journalist robert peston who was in attendance vouches that they did not feel so she does not rush but calmly strides she doesnt even acknowledge field until the moment he pushes her against a pillar anyone who believes a climate protester would be armed needs an urgent appointment with reality anyone watching the video can see not fear let alone panic in fields eyes but rather rage unsurprising for a man who just two months ago wrote a letter demanding the metropolitan police adopt a much firmer grip on climate protesters i can speak from personal experience i have been repeatedly harassed in the street by farright protesters screaming abuse including overt homophobia spitting in my face and attempting to punch me there is no comparison between those fighting the existential threat of the climate emergency and the farright menace the latter is a threat to minorities women and to democracy itself and its foot soldiers have a long history of using violence yet in none of these examples did i lose my temper instead i ridiculed my aggressors even when i was surrounded by several of them i wasnt at a dinner surrounded by dozens of sympathisers being approached by a peaceful female climate protester sometimes incidents should not be seen in isolation as oneoffs but rather as flares lighting up the ugliest features of society first misogyny here is a man using physical force to coerce and intimidate a woman second class privilege here was a closed elite circle invaded by protesters in the proud tradition of peaceful direct action that helped win many of our rights and freedoms attempting to hold our rulers and their powerful friends to account about an existential threat facing our species witness the rightwing hysteria over the milkshaking of nigel farage with a man convicted and sentenced to hours of community service and then imagine if a workingclass black man had been filmed behaving like this would social media and the airwaves be full of rightwing commentators and tory mps defending him third an increasingly authoritarian trumpian approach to dissent in which critics and opponents of the tories are routinely disparaged as traitors saboteurs and indeed enemies of the people field may have been suspended but his career is unlikely to end here a petition demanding his sacking from the government has already attracted thousands of signatures at the last election his majority collapsed from votes to here surely is a priority for a righteous unseating but this whole incident is a chilling reminder of the intersection of misogyny trumpian contempt for dissent and class privilege that blights our society and which has been exacerbated by a tory government increasingly under the

the conservatives have been plunged into controversy after a video showed a minister grab and manhandle a protester who disrupted the chancellors mansion house speech police began looking into the incident on thursday night after footage showed mark field pushing the female greenpeace activist against a pillar and grabbing her neck there were calls for field to lose his position as a foreign office minister in a statement he apologised to the woman and said he would refer himself to the cabinet office over the incident meanwhile a separate scandal threatened the party as antoinette sandbach said she was sent messages by an unnamed fellow conservative mp demanding she leave the party senior tories condemned the messages and pledged to investigate the video footage appeared to show an incident that occurred as dozens of greenpeace activists sought to draw attention to the climate crisis while philip hammond prepared to deliver his setpiece address in the city of london a group most dressed all in red and wearing sashes bearing the words climate emergency attempted to read out a message and drown out hammond in a short clip later posted online by itv news field grabbed one of the female activists shoving her against a pillar and then marched her away while gripping the back of her neck greenpeace uk said we were shocked at the footage of an elected mp and government minister assaulting one of our peaceful protesters at the mansion house tonight city of london police said we have received a small number of third party reports of an assault taking place at the mansion house event these reports are being looked into by police no arrests had been made officers said the conservative party chairman brandon lewis said the incident had been referred for an internal investigation telling itvs good morning britain on friday its very hard not to be astonished by what youve seen labour mp dawn butler said the incident shown in the footage was horrific and appeared to be an assault she tweeted field must be immediately suspended or sacked im sure im not the only one who is wondering why no one intervened so much violence does not seem justified an investigation needs to take place as soon as possible in a statement field said he reacted instinctively and had been genuinely worried that the protester might be armed he said he grasped the intruder firmly in order to remove her from the room as swiftly as possible adding i deeply regret this episode and unreservedly apologise to the lady concerned for grabbing her but in the current climate i felt i needed to act decisively to close down the threat to the safety of those present field said he had referred himself to the cabinet office to examine if there has been a breach of the ministerial code and will of course cooperate fully with their investigation the liberal democrat former cabinet minister sir ed davey called on field to resign from the government no ifs no buts about this the sight of some penguinsuited tory minister behaving in a violent way towards a female greenpeace activist absolutely stinks fields fellow conservative mp alistair burt was shown the clip by the bbcs newsnight programme and afterwards said mark will answer for himself but it looks to be a very difficult situation for everyone concerned the tory mp sir peter bottomley defended field saying the activist was trying to create a fuss most viewers would say its good that she didnt succeed last month field delivered a speech at a westminster hall debate in which he decried violence against and intimidation of female activists across the world the foreign office and downing street were contacted for comment according to the video the rest of the activists were forced out of the room after they had been removed hammond claimed it was ironic they had chosen to stage the protest shortly after the government had announced its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by afterwards greenpeace uk countered that the treasury had tried to water down the governments action on climate change also on thursday night sandbach posted an image on social media of messages she said were from a colleague and suggested that similar abuse had been behind the decisions of three female former tory mps to leave the party barely is the ink dry on the results and the dark ops begin sandbach who supported rory stewart in the leadership race wrote on twitter this from a male conservative mp to me as i sit on the train home the messages which came only hours after tory mps voted boris johnson and the foreign secretary jeremy hunt through to the final round of the party leadership contest read you too are a disgrace time you left the party i think she tagged it with the words completewankspangle and later deleted the tweet in a supplementary tweet that remained live the mp for eddisbury added its bad enough when you get it from complete strangers is it any wonder three female mps left hunt denounced the messages and added we have to come together as a party julian smith the government chief whip promised to investigate and offered to meet sandbach on monday smith said the messages were totally unacceptable and thanked sandbach for supporting the government in parliamentary votes on theresa mays brexit withdrawal agreement sandbach told the guardian on thursday

almost a third of parliamentarians in the house of commons are women an alltime high this success is beginning to highlight the archaic working practices that prevent parliament from being representative of the nation it serves in a brave and important article for these pages the labour mp stella creasy outlined her fight to get paid maternity cover for her work as a parliamentarian outside of the commons ms creasy has suffered repeated miscarriages she now is pregnant again and says she can no longer keep her public and private lives separate what she wants is maternity cover for mps so that in the autumn her constituents in east london are not left without representation this seems a reasonable request that ought not only to be granted to ms creasy but also afforded to all parliamentarians a woman should not to be forced to choose between being a mother and an mp for too long westminster has been run in otherworldly terms the block to progress appears to be twofold first members of parliament are officeholders not employees whereas many employees have line managers mps have voters to answer to mps cannot seek recourse through employment law they find themselves in a situation familiar to many selfemployed people however mps obligations are unlike the selfemployed often largely out of their control it is also the case that mps hours are not normal working hours and their work is undertaken in the chamber and in their constituencies voters expectations are high they demand wellresearched replies to their emails and letters within hours not days they expect mps to give up weekends and evenings to attend events and hold surgeries a minority of mps might fall short of these assumptions but most do not second the independent parliamentary standards authority ipsa set up in the wake of the expenses scandal has looked askance at shelling out for staff who could deputise at constituency events for an mp at home with a newborn child this is wrong it is understandable that ms creasy is so incensed that she is looking at taking ipsa to court for not respecting her right to family life it is important to recognise that ipsa makes casebycase decisions but it has been accepted that business managers could be hired to support female mps when they need to be away in a stcentury parliament this should become a right afforded to all parents such a system would still need oversight but crucially the default setting would be that mps are entitled to cover it is also wrong that some mps in the past have thought twice about getting help because any sums approved by ipsa appear in its books as expenses without any explanation while politics should not be seen as a moneyspinning career it ought not to be one that militates against justice parliament has made positive changes to become more family friendly in recent years introducing proxy voting and changing sitting hours but it has a long way to go two leading candidates in the current race to be the next prime minister have backed ms creasys campaign once the tory leadership race has been resolved this matter should be urgently addressed if good sense does not prevail and ipsa cannot properly support mps to represent their constituencies then the commons should amend the law that set up the body so that it does it took almost a century and a half to get a creche in parliament getting parental rights for mps ought to happen far far faster than that,2019-06,almost third parliamentarian house common woman alltime high success beginning highlight archaic working

theresa may has urged the parliamentary standards authority to review its policies towards expectant mothers after the labour mp stella creasy said she felt parliament was in effect telling her to choose between being a mum and being an mp the walthamstow mp who is pregnant received support from jeremy hunt and sajid javid two of the contenders to succeed may who both urged action to be taken

support for constituency work after she gave birth writing in the guardian creasy said she had decided to speak out after experiencing two miscarriages during which she was forced to continue to work as normal without any additional support now pregnant again she said she had been told mps would not be provided with any additional funding by ipsa for support staff to allow her to get extra help with constituency work asked about creasys article mays spokesman said no one should have to choose between being a mum and being an mp while parliament has made positive changes to becoming more familyfriendly in recent years such as introducing proxy voting and changing sitting hours stella creasys comments highlight that there is much more to do it is ultimately up to ipsa to make decisions on pay and allowances for mps but the prime minister would urge them to look very closely at the issues that have been raised by stella creasy and determine what more support such as temporary staffing can be provided hunt and javid also urged action in tweets hunt the foreign secretary said it was impossible to argue with creasys views adding insidious to force mps to choose between serving their constituents and spending precious time with their newborn come on ipsa do the right thing javid the home secretary tweeted creasy to congratulate her on the pregnancy saying i

said she had to arrange the medical procedure around constituency advice surgeries heartbroken by all the years that i have struggled with fertility ive kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected she wrote now im pregnant once more and terrified not just that it will go wrong again but because i know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible creasy said she had approached ipsa about funding for cover but was told it does not recognise that mps go on maternity leave humiliatingly it is making me beg for

continuity of services in denmark a member of the national parliament would have a substitute mp appointed creasy said she had been heartened by the introduction of proxy voting introduced this year

even when youve spent a lifetime fighting for equality you can still be floored by the way discrimination manifests itself i never thought parliament would tell me to choose between being an mp and being a mum my labour colleague tulip siddiq was forced to postpone a csection so she could cast a vote in the debate on theresa mays brexit deal in january and that caused a rightful outcry westminster can when it wants make it possible to combine parenthood with legislating and siddiqs push for progress on a system that would have allowed her to vote by proxy demonstrates it but allowing an mp to nominate someone to vote on their behalf when they need to be at home with their children is just one piece of a much bigger equality puzzle during my first miscarriage aching and bleeding i joined a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent the day after i found out that another babys heartbeat had stopped i led a public meeting on gang crime i even scheduled the procedure to remove the body on a day i didnt have a constituency advice surgery heartbroken by all the years that i have struggled with fertility ive kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected now im pregnant once more and terrified not just that it will go wrong again but because i know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible im coming forward publicly to talk about it because as for far too many women the personal inevitably becomes political when reproduction is involved the independent parliamentary standards authority ipsa is the independent body that since has on behalf of taxpayers regulated the pay of mps and authorised the budgets we claim for our work ipsa has a duty to ensure that we are resourced appropriately to carry out parliamentary duties but it says it does not recognise that mps go on maternity leave thus it feels no responsibility to make provision for any paid cover for what we do outside the parliamentary chamber the campaigns constituency casework and municipal work that all mps do harriet harman wrote movingly of trying to cover constituency duties with babies in tow in the s despite warm words about maternity cover two years ago from ipsa things have gone backwards humiliatingly it is making me beg for extra staff funding or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents dont miss out if a gp or vicar were on leave a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of community services in denmark a member of the national parliament would have a substitute mp appointed my experience is not unique other mps who have had children since ipsa was created have told me of the same rejection of their requests for help on the basis that mps do not take maternity leave siddiq herself had to return to doing casework three days after a csection some mps have tried to be with their newborn child at least for a few weeks hoping residents dont notice their absence and the correspondence doesnt pile up too much or begging colleagues to cover casework several have ended up taking their children with them to meetings so they can feed them with constituents acting as proxy babysitters while trying to talk to their representative no community should miss out on representation because its mp is pregnant nor should my opponents be able to argue theres a cost to my constituents because i may succeed in my quest to conceive for all the talk of being family friendly westminster is still struggling to offer deeds instead of words and if we cant get this right for mps how can we get this right for parents elsewhere britain still has a long way to go to ensure that fertility isnt a barrier to equality a third of employers think its acceptable to ask women about their plans for having a family at a job interview nondisclosure agreements are used frequently to cover up pregnancy discrimination with the legal advice service pregnant then screwed receiving on average calls a year this inequality isnt just in the workplace fertility treatment is a minefield in terms of access and quality leading many to go abroad if thousands of brits went overseas for experimental optometry it would be a national priority to ensure no one returned blind but women are left to congregate in online chatrooms to share ivf reviews and pricing plans as a commercial industry supplants public provision in a way we wouldnt accept with any other branch of healthcare increasingly our bodies are the battlefield of political change we need to bring together the fight for the right to reproduce and the right not to do so not least because in these trumpinspired times those who seek to control women find it politically expedient in georgia ohio kentucky mississippi and louisiana i would potentially have faced a criminal investigation to ensure i had not caused my own miscarriages because they were later than their sixweek abortion deadline our own government forces women to continue unwanted pregnancies by retaining an outright ban on abortion in northern ireland prejudices and unhelpful tropes about motherhood suffocate female representatives whether we have children or not in a way that is rarely true for our male counterparts for my work on abortion rights i have been trolled relentlessly with the charge that it is my own childlessness that drives my desire to kill other peoples babies campaigners opposed to providing lgbt sex and relationship education in schools once surrounded me in my constituency screaming that i didnt have children of my own so how could i understand their concerns my political opponents have printed campaign leaflets highlighting their candidates motherhood and marriage to demonstrate how i was deficient when i talk to male colleagues whether fathers or not none of this behaviour even rings a bell achieving a world in which women are not discriminated against because they can carry children means challenging all of these attitudes and the policies that go with them from the parliamentary authorities to our healthcare services and workplaces its time to stop asking nicely for the discrimination to be dealt with it is time to refuse to wait patiently and instead to make it a a priority as a politician ive never stopped fighting for women to have control over their own bodies through the provision of reproductive rights and services as the nonnegotiable prerequisite of equality as a pregnant woman this recent experience is another bitter reminder that its still often men this time the ipsa executives who will make the choices that determine if that battle will be won stella creasy is the labour and

it was meant to be malicious i think it was genuinely something that had not been dealt with but it is the most normal thing in the world having a baby siddiq said she had carried on doing her constituency emails from her hospital bed but had been supported in constituency events by keir starmer whose constituency neighbours hers he helped because we unofficially paired up but that was the goodness of his heart if you share a borough with an opposition mp they wouldnt do it she said in a way no one else can really do your job fulltime its a privilege to be an mp but me doing any less is a real stress on my staff members and having any extra help to deal with casework and emails which is of the work would make life so much easier in the first couple of months she has continued doing

health but my physical health not having to travel to parliament for very late night votes she said creasy said the struggle mps experienced trying to take adequate maternity leave was one of many

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday who will replace sanders another empowered woman no doubt the kindest thing you can say about sarah sanders is that she was completely useless she didnt bother disguising her disdain for reporters she didnt bother holding press briefings the last one was over days ago and she didnt bother with the truth she was an incompetent press secretary heres the thing though sanders was never really hired to be a press secretary her real job id venture was to be a very visible woman her real job was to be the female face of a deeply misogynistic administration to play the role of the empowered working mother and make the trump administrations crass patriarchy more palatable for a while sanders was extremely effective at weaponizing her womanhood when politically convenient for example shed bring up the fact that she was the first mother to have the role of press secretary that says less about me than it does about this president sanders told reporters in she then went on to disingenuously claim that empowering working moms is the heart of the presidents agenda particularly when it comes to things like tax reform theres no better example of how effective sanders was at using her sex as a shield than the speed with which a number of highprofile female journalists jumped to sanders defense when michelle wolf made a joke about the press secretary at the white house correspondents dinner watching a wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable msnbcs mika brzezinski tweeted at the time wolf didnt make a joke about sanders looks this was a willful misinterpretation the new york times maggie haberman similarly announced that it was admirable sanders sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance her job performance and so forth instead of walking out on national television sanders is far from the only woman to have played an important role in the trump administration while trump may not have a feminist bone in his body hes elevated a number of women into highprofile positions a talking point frequently repeated by his acolytes women like kellyanne conway nikki haley kirstjen nielsen and of course ivanka trump have been some of the most prominent faces of his administration these footsoldiers of the patriarchy have helped to roll back womens rights and reinforce inequality while allowing the trump administration to boast about empowering women you could call it whitewomanwashing its not clear who is going to replace sanders yet and lets face it in many ways she is irreplaceable however my bet is that trump is strategically going to pick another woman indeed rumours are currently swirling that stephanie grisham melanias spokeswoman is one of the leading candidates for the job whoever it is good luck to them sanders has set a high bar for odiousness hers will be a tough act to follow my little lesbian pony my little pony a childrens cartoon featuring little ponies is marking pride month with its first lesbian horse couple they are called aunt holiday and auntie lofty and they take care of a little

for a lot of women finding out you are pregnant opens up an array of questions will the baby be a boy or girl will everything go smoothly with the pregnancy sadly another question that often pops up amid the excitement is how will my employer take the news that i am expecting a baby pregnancy discrimination is a huge problem in the uk with around threequarters of pregnant women experiencing some form of disadvantage at work in a survey for the equality and human rights commission one in nine mothers reported that they were either dismissed made compulsorily redundant or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their jobs thats the equivalent of new mothers a year yesterday a new report from mps highlighted evidence that some companies are pressurising women to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to cover up this unlawful behaviour and discrimination i was one of those women i had been a victim of pregnancy and maternity discrimination in a previous job i had worked for the company for several years and never had any issues and then i became pregnant as soon as i announced my pregnancy the atmosphere at work changed from being friendly to hostile and cold luckily i already knew about rights during pregnancy as this was not my first child and i had previously worked in a human resources role yet despite knowing my rights and what i was entitled to with the workplace suddenly so unfriendly i was made to feel like an inconvenience i tried to arrange all of my appointments around my working hours to cause as little disruption as possible while on leave i was not informed about or invited to any company events including teambuilding holidays and trainings my keeping in touch days which were scheduled months in advance were cancelled despite having been organised around training dates for a new project this meant that when i did return i was already at a disadvantage compared to my colleagues all of this made my maternity leave and impending return to work extremely stressful on my return to work i had to fight for basic rights such as accrued holidays and bank holidays when i asked to take parental leave to settle my child into new childcare arrangements this was frowned upon around six months after my return to work i was told that my role was vulnerable to redundancy i was stunned and i questioned their decision the business was growing and i could see that there was a need for more people to do the job i was doing we were managing an evergrowing number of clients how could there be no need for my job later i was called in to the office and offered a settlement agreement asked to think about the offer and to leave the building once i had the chance to read through the paperwork i realised i was being asked to sign an nda the terms of this agreement meant i was unable to name the company in conjunction with the discrimination i had faced i did not like the thought of being silenced not only was i being treated unfairly but i was also being forced to mute my experiences but there were still fees to pay back then to bring a case to employment tribunal this seriously affected my decision on whether to sign i was a single parent i had young children with no assurance that i would be able to find another job soon i did not have the resources needed to tackle the discrimination i was facing after seeking advice from the charity maternity action and from the advisory conciliation and arbitration service acas i decided that it would probably be in my and my childrens best interests to sign the nda i could not face a long and arduous battle that would not only cost me money but time and distress my settlement was substantial enough to deter me from bringing a tribunal claim against my employers i would not have agreed to sign if the payment could not cover the amount of time i needed to regroup so that i could rejoin the work force i believe that better protections for mothers returning from maternity leave would prevent issues like this from arising so often there are protections from redundancy during maternity leave which is why many employers wait until someone has returned and the protection has ended extending that period would protect women at a very vulnerable time of their lives when they need to provide for their babies by returning to work pregnancy and maternity discrimination feels so isolating and limiting however since my experience i have met many women with stories similar to mine across various industries and pay grades its an epidemic that affects countless women,2019-06,lot

women who have been abused by a partner are three times more likely to suffer depression anxiety or severe conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder than other women according to research the study is one of the first in the uk to probe the relationship between domestic abuse and mental health it found that it was twodirectional women who had been to their gp about mental health problems were also three times more likely to report domestic abuse at a later date nearly half of those who were abused already had mental health problems the research also suggests that women do not always tell their gp of abuse only of women on the primary care lists used in the study had reported domestic abuse to the gp while police report that one in four women are affected over their lifetime the researchers from birmingham university say that opportunities to spot the signs of domestic abuse and to tackle it are being missed there does seem to be significant underrecording of domestic abuse within uk primary care we are not saying that gps should be asking the question more said dr joht singh chandan academic clinical fellow in public health and lead author but they do believe there should be better sharing of such information between the public services the study published in the british journal of psychiatry looked at primary care records relating to women in the uk between and it matched women who had reported abuse with women who had not they made allowances for other factors that can play a part in mental health such as deprivation smoking and drinking habits and body mass index a measure of obesity dr beena rajkumar cochair of the womens mental health special interest group at the royal college of psychiatrists said as a frontline psychiatrist working with women with severe mental illness i am all too aware of the devastating impact domestic abuse has on mental health and i work with survivors every day this study highlights the twoway relationship between abuse and mental illness including serious mental illness and carries a very important warning that we are missing opportunities to detect abuse that is happening all over the country today screening and recording of domestic abuse needs to be a clear priority for public services so that more effective interventions for this group of vulnerable women can urgently be put in place it is not easy to work out the exact connection between domestic abuse and mental illness louise howard of the national institute for health research at kings college london said other factors were likely to play a part for example we know that childhood maltreatment and sexual abuse are associated with mental illness and with being a victim of domestic violence and abuse but she said the important takeaway message of this study is that domestic violence and abuse is a serious public health and public mental health problem health practitioners who see women with mental health problems in primary or secondary care therefore need to be trained how to ask routinely about domestic violence and abuse and how to safely respond minds head of policy and campaigns vicki nash said that the journey to good mental health can be difficult particularly for women who have faced traumatic life events the new prime minister must pass the domestic abuse bill to ensure women get the mental health support they need she said whoever becomes prime minister must commit to improving womens experiences of mental health services as well as working on a joinedup approach which tackles problems with social care justice housing health and benefits only then will women with mental health problems get the support they deserve in the uk the domestic violence helpline is in australia the national

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday notallmen says meryl streep meryl streep isnt a big fan of the phrase toxic masculinity apparently during a recent panel discussion about the new season of big little lies the cast started talking about how many men enjoyed the femaleled show streep then announced that we hurt our boys by calling something toxic masculinity women can be pretty fucking toxic its toxic people we have our good angles and we have our bad ones streep continued i think the labels are less helpful than what were trying to get to which is a communication direct between human beings were all on the boat together weve got to make it work excuse me can someone stop the boat for a moment please i just need a second while my eyes stop rolling seriously meryl seriously i dont want to label streeps comments ridiculous because labels are less helpful than what im trying to get to which is the fact streep clearly has no idea what toxic masculinity means i shouldnt have to say this it should be obvious but toxic masculinity doesnt mean that men are toxic or that masculinity is de facto toxic rather it means that extreme forms of traits traditionally associated with masculinity like aggression and stoicism are toxic rightwingers however like to pretend the phrase is an attack on men because its a quick way of derailing a conversation about rigid gender norms and allows them to pretend that feminism is some sort of plot against men indeed conservative outlets like fox news are already having a field day with streeps comments we dont hurt our boys by labelling certain behavior toxic masculinity we hurt our boys when we teach them that being a man means suppressing your emotions and treating women as an inferior species to be dominated and controlled and toxic masculinity doesnt just hurt men it kills them in america for example men are times more likely to die from suicide than women a phenomenon many experts attribute in part to the fact that men are told they shouldnt express emotion or admit that they feel vulnerable and therefore are less likely to seek professional help its also well established that toxic masculinity kills women women are far more likely than men to die at the hands of their partner to cite just one example as a united nations global study on homicide notes intimate partner violence against women and girls is rooted in widelyaccepted gender norms about mens authority and mens use of violence to exert control over women research shows that men and boys who adhere to rigid views of gender roles and masculinity are more likely to use violence against a partner streep is right that women can also be pretty fucking toxic but again she misses the point completely the issue isnt individual women but rigid social norms associated with femininity being told that being a woman means being pretty and pure is toxic being told that your worth as a woman rests on getting married and having kids is toxic being taught to cry and play the damsel in distress to avoid accountability is toxic being taught to treat other women as sexual rivals is toxic heres the big difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity however the latter is a lot less deadly a lot less dangerous the difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity is that the president of the united states is not a woman who has boasted about grabbing men by their genitals and dismissed this as locker room talk the difference is that there arent two female supreme court justices who have been accused of sexual misconduct the difference is that a group of powerful women are not currently passing legislation preventing american men having control over their own bodies the fact that streep can talk about how toxic masculinity as a phrase harms boys at a time when american women are currently facing a fullon assault of their reproductive rights is mindboggling the fact that she can blithely say that were all on the boat together when republicans have made it very clear theyre steering the boat towards gilead is infuriating but at least she stopped her lecture on civility there i suppose we can at least be grateful that she didnt go on to inform us that all lives matter and we shouldnt focus on labels or race because were all africans really womens fertility app funded by antiabortion campaigners a guardian investigation has found that the femm app which helps women keep track of their menstrual cycle received large amounts of funding from

when i watched the video of mark fields actions against the greenpeace protester janet barker i had a visceral reaction tears rushed into my eyes when confronted with the rage in his expression the shock on her face i wasnt alone many women i spoke to saw the assertion of a brutal kind of male dominance some knew all too well the moment when a man aggressively decides that an outspoken woman must be put in her place for those of us who know the reality of male violence against women this looked like a moment when a pervasive culture of male entitlement escaped into the open just over a month after field manhandled barker from a black tie dinner the prime minister has dropped the whitehall investigation into his behaviour the decision came after johnson sacked field from his role as a foreign office minister saying the investigation was a matter for the previous pm an investigation into whether an mp should be a minister when he has already lost his ministerial post is arguably redundant but johnsons actions leave a sour taste this looks like powerful men closing ranks against women and not for the first time after all isnt that just what happened on the night of the incident while women were reacting online with horror those in the room were reacting with silence at best cheers at worst the welldressed diners closed ranks against the woman from greenpeace and took the part of the man with his hands on the back of her neck we were told that field was a hero for what he did we were told to be thankful that it wasnt worse we were told to calm down and move on moving on is exactly what this government has now done the dropping of the investigation feels like the natural conclusion to that silence those claps and those praisefilled tweets its hard to avoid an impression of the powerful protecting one another and it sends a clear message to men you can behave with aggression towards women and so long as its politically expedient eventually no one will care because make no mistake dropping the investigation is highly politically expedient the new prime minister has come to power with a waferthin majority thats set to go down to one if the conservatives lose thursdays byelection in brecon and radnorshire although he sacked field from the foreign office the reason was more brexit than conduct johnson cant afford to lose the support of any mps and dropping an investigation is one way to bolster goodwill this isnt the first time in recent months that women have been sold down the river for political advantage in december theresa may restored the whip to two mps facing allegations of sexual misconduct in order to get through her vote of no confidence one of them charlie elphicke has since been charged with three counts of sexual assault for a leader potentially facing an election who has low popularity with female voters not least for his jokes that voting tory could make your wifes breasts bigger and that women only go to university to get a man this could have been an opportunity for johnson to make a positive stand for women and prove himself the feminist he claims to be obviously field couldnt lose his ministerial role twice but a completed investigation would at least have created an opportunity to hold his conduct to account and sent a clear message that his behaviour had been taken seriously by those in charge the whole sorry situation raises serious questions about the efficacy of parliament for dealing with incidents such as these field was only ever at risk of losing his place in the foreign office not his job as an mp while procedure allows johnson to decide to drop the investigation and politically it makes sense for women watching it feels like yet another kick in the teeth because wasnt it supposed to be different by now when women bravely came forward at the end of shouting metoo in the heart of westminster werent we promised something better werent we told the government was going to take male violence against women seriously and put their house in order werent we supposed to see an end to the boys club that protected their own within hours of the field incident president trump was accused of sexually assaulting another woman the severity of those two incidents is not the same but they have something in common they show that when powerful men are accused of violence or aggression often nothing changes for them sian norris is a writer and feminist activist,2019-07,watched video mark field action greenpeace protester janet barker visceral reaction tear rushed eye

the morrison government has outraged family violence support service providers and advocates by confirming it will go ahead with plans to potentially fund couples counselling for abuse perpetrators and their victims critics including abuse survivors have urged the government to rethink a m domestic violence package to fund services including counselling and dispute resolution to individuals or couples in a letter to the social services minister anne ruston womens safety groups said counselling where domestic violence was a factor was unsafe and not recommended by any representative specialist domestic and family violence service peak body practitioner group or research organisation nationally the peak body for mens behaviour change organisations no to violence has said it cannot stress enough the real danger this type of funding creates the australian women against violence alliance which is funded by the federal government to provide advice on womens safety said it had not been consulted about the plan the alliances program manager merrindahl andrew told guardian australia it was a major concern the chief executive of the family violence charity the lokahi foundation rachael natoli said women might not be able to be honest about the abuse they were experiencing in couples counselling sessions either way its a loselose situation because if we go to those sessions and we are not honest were not going to achieve anything from it and if we go and the counsellor says something that leads to us being in any way honest about the state of the relationship we are completely in danger when we leave that situation a spokeswoman for ruston said the expanded family violence services package was primarily focused on providing additional services for children who witness or experience violence the spokeswoman said the government would not fund activities that do not demonstrate strong safety practices there was no money in the budget specifically earmarked for couples counselling the spokeswoman said the extra funding will also pay for behaviour change programs and support for victims and their children only invited organisations are allowed to apply for the funding and almost half are religiousbased groups labors social services spokeswoman linda burney said the womens groups had raised legitimate concerns about women seeking support with family violence being placed in situations where they are not safe the government should urgently listen to these groups the government has stressed that the sessions will be voluntary but critics say this ignores the dynamics of an abusive relationship there are many women who agree to doing couples counselling but they do so under duress because they are fearful or intimidated said hayley foster the chief executive of womens safety nsw other victims would engage in couples counselling willingly because they have the idea that they are in some way responsible for the abuse and need to fix it foster said if somebody wants to approach a family and relationships centre and domestic violence was picked up the bestpractice response would be to refer each of the parties off to specialist domestic and family violence services she said natoli said i cant imagine you know being recommended to go to those sessions when youre going to a support service for help and for support and i cant imagine anybody recommending that the best way for me to deal with being in an abusive relationship is to go and talk it through with that abuser in australia the national family violence counselling

despite our best intentions to equally parent our firstborn child my husband and i slipped into the traditional roles of him returning to work while i took on the childcare we were both selfemployed and freelance fathers arent entitled to paternity pay so rich took less than two weeks off before returning fulltime to his job it was the same when our son was born two years later except that by that point id built a freelance career from home so i was then looking after a twoyearold a newborn and a business we are weeks away from the birth of our third baby and this time we have decided to do things differently earlier this year i had a book published the freelance mum off the back of it i was able to launch an online course advising small businesses and freelancers on doing their own pr there was clearly an appetite for this course and i launched another on becoming your own boss having proved that this online course business was not just viable but also lucrative bringing in a month with no overheads we decided it made sense for rich to quit his job his knees were suffering from years of building work and he wanted to spend more time with our children also he made documentary films and wondered if he could find time for that if we adjusted our worklife situation he is now supporting me with the marketing side of my business and there is less pressure on us with everything split more or less equally at home research suggests businesses run by mothers contribute upwards of bn to the uk economy each year but the gender pay gap is one reason why fathers stepping back from their careers to prioritise their partners isnt that common with men earning more on average it often makes financial sense for women to take on the childcare but this widens the pay gap further because when mothers do return to work the cost of childcare can be prohibitively expensive and they struggle to find work that can fit around family interestingly research this year from dove mencare revealed that uk fathers were increasingly keen to play an active role in their childrens early years with of those polled saying they would do anything to be involved during the first weeks yet just of fathers in the uk took the full two weeks of paternity leave and took no time off at all in order to bring about change we need to be sharing childcare from birth as this sets the precedent for the familys homework balance down the line this is why sarah akwisombe and her husband jason reassessed their careers after the birth of their first baby sarah was running her own business the no bull business school and jason was working for an insurance firm at first he went parttime to help out more with their daughter marley but as sarahs business grew and her income increased he started to see where he could add value we had always discussed working together he says and we both wanted a life with more freedom and flexibility so he quit his job to help sarah taking on the admin work i dont know how other women do everything says sarah it takes two people to have children and keep a house running so why is this seen as womens work both sexes are equally able jason is the one who knows if something is missing from marleys school bag he books her swimming lessons and dance classes i do the cooking and laundry we play to our strengths it helps that jason was raised in a family that valued equal contributions in the home and workplace i had a strong female role model growing up in tanzania he says my mother was entrepreneurial and i learned that no particular jobs are assigned a gender childcare is something to be shared by both parents and the idea of women being the main caregiver is an outdated concept hannah saunders and david round were also open to challenging gender norms but after becoming a mother at hannah quit her year career as a civil servant and launched big fish little fish family raves while they had planned to share the childcare hannah soon found herself taking on the majority of it as david was often travelling for work as director of purchasing pr and marketing for a wine merchant and not making it home in time to put the kids to bed mutually dissatisfied with this hannah persuaded david to quit his job she was not sure how they would cope going from two salaried jobs to none and growing a business while raising a young family it felt like wed run off to join the circus but she found this more thrilling than nervewracking at first david was a fulltime dad to their two children and though he knew this was going against the grain he did not feel negatively judged by others it felt exciting to have this chance to spend so much time with our children he says but he did find himself in a culture that did not hugely welcome fathers he had taken the children to baby groups that were populated with mothers who ignored him in time he developed a routine that suited him and the kids and as they have grown older he has become more involved in hannahs business although work and family time blend sometimes to the annoyance of their children they agree that working together has created a much more settled home life alice darbyshire an hr expert who focuses on helping mothers back into the workplace believes that if more men step away from their careers to support their partners after having a baby it will be positive all round the talent pool will look different and businesses may need to look beyond their traditional places and types of person to fill vacancies especially if they currently unconsciously lean towards male candidates she says in addition she says the language used in business and legislation will change for example i love the idea of having primary carer leave rather than maternity leave or even scrapping anything to do with caring responsibility and just long leave which indicates anyone going on leave for six months or more whatever the reason in a culture that creates more work opportunities for men the notion of them stepping away to allow their partners to build their careers may feel financially counterintuitive but as jason says our outdated system has created a society of men who find fulfilment and value from being the main earner and the idea of sharing childcare emasculating the more we see examples of mothers as primary earners and fathers as primary caregivers the less uncomfortable it will become but we need those first couples to switch up the status quo and demonstrate how well it can work im pleased to be one of

theresa may is throwing down the gauntlet to her successor pushing for fathers to have more time with their newborns writing in the guardian she says she hopes that better paternity leave and time off work to care for premature infants will be one of her lasting legacies as prime minister she says the status quo is holding back women and reinforcing the gender pay gap she writes more often than not it is the mother who cuts her hours or opts to works flexibly the mother who decides not to go for promotion the mother who stays at home when the child is ill much of the gender pay gap can be traced back to the balance of childcare responsibilities while the lack of women in senior positions is partly caused by the fact that mothers much more than fathers are too often expected to juggle careers with caring may says that division is not inevitable but that policy is not sending fathers the correct message when our current leave allowances give women times more leave than men on friday the government will launch a consultation on changes to parental leave entitlements one of mays last acts as prime minister and which will have to be enacted by her successor the proposal envisages a longer period of paternity leave as well as a new neonatal leave entitlement for parents of premature and sick babies who need to spend a prolonged period in hospital may says she believes the choice offered to parents by shared parental leave was gradually starting to shift societal attitudes about who should stay home with a baby but that the slow uptake makes it clear the government has to go further all too often it is still mothers not fathers who shoulder the burden of childcare so it is clear that we need to do more the uk has some of the most generous maternity leave allowances in the world but we only guarantee new dads and samesex partners a fortnight off work making it harder for them to bond with their child and care for their partner and implying that it is the lot of the mother to be the primary caregiver may says giving fathers longer leave and better pay to spend time with their newborns will not only benefit children but equalise men and womens roles both at home and in the workplace caring for children is a shared responsibility and means that employers will not be able to make assumptions about who will take on childcare responsibilities when a couple starts a family she says she was deeply affected by a visit to alder hay childrens hospital when she met parents whose babies had been born prematurely or suffered complications and the fathers were worried they would need to return to work before their newborns got home thats not fair and its not right these are issues close to my heart and im proud that todays consultation the next evolution of the shared parental leave policy that i started long ago is one of my final acts as prime minister,2019-07,theresa may throwing gauntlet successor pushing father time newborn writing guardian say hope

rural women enduring domestic abuse are half as likely as urban victims to report their suffering and are being failed by authorities with perpetrators shielded by countryside culture a report says abusers are protected by the isolation of the countryside and traditional patriarchal attitudes says the report from the national rural crime network it is the first study of its kind and finds that closeknit rural communities can facilitate abuse which can last on average longer than in urban areas some abusers move their partners from urban areas where detection is more likely to rural areas the report published on wednesday says rurality and isolation are used as a weapon by abusers financial control removal from friends isolation from family are all wellunderstood tools of abuse it continues we have revealed a traditional society where women and it is mostly women are subjugated abused and controlled not just by an individual abuser but de facto by very the communities in which they live too often left unsupported and unprotected this is not at all unique to rural areas but it is very significant and change is slow abusers exploiting isolation is a common theme in the report one woman said my partner used to deliberately drive off to work with the kids car seats in his car which meant i could not go anywhere safely because i was stuck in the cottage with the kids it was just another way he isolated me and kept me from interacting with anyone else the national rural crime network is funded largely by police forces and their police and crime commissioners to improve public safety in rural areas the report says that traditional patriarchal communities control and subjugate women rural communities are still dominated by men and follow a set of ageold protected and unwritten principles men tend to hold the rural positions of power head of the household landowner landlord policeman farmer this patriarchal society makes women more vulnerable to coercion and control prevented from speaking out and accessing support some cases have led to murder such as that of lance hart who shot dead his wife claire and daughter charlotte in spalding lincolnshire in before killing himself claire hart suffered years of controlling behaviour without the authorities realising and was killed after leaving her abusive husband one caseworker in county durham said of the people suffering many of them are in such a stressful situation they have shut down from any kind of rational thinking its like all their effort goes into survival mode or protection for the kids the longer it goes on the less likely they are to see the dangers escape is harder than in urban britain because of shrinking resources and cuts to public services the report says the availability of public services in rural areas more generally is on the decline limiting the support networks and escape routes available to victims a recently evidenced reduction in rural gp practices and challenges of effective broadband are good examples this equally extends to services like buses and trains whereby it remains very difficult and getting worse to travel within rural areas without a private vehicle abusers use this to limit victims movements rendering already inaccessible services all but impossible to contact tightknit communities keep victims in abusive relationships with perpetrators masquerading as pillars of rural life one victim said in reality no one wants to get involved in another persons personal life in my case because he played for the village cricket team he had the support of everyone and this made me feel even more isolated it was like no one would ever take my side over his women were expected to perform traditional roles under threat of abuse one female victim said i understood what happened when i failed to provide what was expected it started with a row angry words really and then a crushing silence later this escalated to more consistent violence but never when the children were around he would twist my arm or pull my hair and kind of whisper that i wasnt treating him properly only once did he actually strike me hard it was a punch to my stomach all i had to do was perform in my role and i did the study says the police response is improving but worse than that in urban areas one victim said i never really considered calling the police whats the point by that time i had been hit slapped or punched anyway julia mulligan the chair of the national rural crime network who is also the north yorkshire police fire and crime commissioner said they are underestimating what is going on in rural communities and police need to listen there are also horror stories involving the police the report details one womans experience the first officer had implied she was silly and neurotic he subsequently faced disciplinary action it took nearly two years for her case to come to court and during that time she was befriended by another officer however the relationship turned toxic he took advantage of the situation and also became controlling and monitored her movements this officer was also a prominent member of the local community and shared mutual friends with her exhusband the woman said i have lost everything i owned because i have had to leave and yet i am the victim mulligan said this report is clear domestic abuse is hidden under our noses hidden by abusers who like to keep it that way and on a scale of abuse hitherto unseen its scale and nature is starkly exposed for the first time nodding and promising to carry

the suspended minister mark field has referred to a homelessness charity in his constituency as a magnet for undesirables in a leaked email the guardian can reveal field was suspended as a foreign office minister in june after the release of a video that showed him pushing a female greenpeace activist against a pillar and grabbing her neck while she protested at the chancellors mansion house speech he faces fresh criticism after revelations that he described the passage a local charity in westminster central london that helps vulnerable and homeless people as a magnet for these undesirables to flood into victoria field said it is high time that the passage started to take a little more responsibility for its clients the mp who lives in westminster made the remark in response to an email from a neighbour who complained about the level of antisocial behaviour linked to homeless people in the area the resident said the soup kitchens which act like a magnet for not just vagrants but also drug dealers with consequences that have been sufficiently highlighted by my neighbours in words and images day in and day out night in and night out we see the same faces sleeping rough same voices shouting and swearing same sleeping bags in the same places she continued we have seen mothers grasping their children on their way to school while loud and inappropriate discussion takes place among homeless in the street many of these problems are caused by people with mental health alcohol and drug abuse issues who should not be there many of them are not british the email concluded ultimately this is a police responsibility the police numbers have however been substantially reduced he replied to the email copying in westminster council figures and michael gove the environment secretary field said i would totally endorse every word of the email before going on to criticise the local charity for their handling of the situation the guardian contacted the passage but it said it did not want to comment stephen robertson the chief executive of the big issue foundation said the use of pejorative terminology to describe marginalised people had no place in this day and age he said it serves only to stigmatise individuals questioning their fundamental legitimacy and reinforcing the impossibility of tackling societal challenges the use of xenophobic discriminatory shorthand betrays deeply held prejudices that serve only to injure and harm the recipients when used within powerful institutions it promotes as acceptable beliefs that can consciously and subconsciously influence policy and practice for the worse field said clearly since the accession of new eu members in i should say at this point that my late mother was born in modernday poland there is little doubt that a significantly higher proportion of the homeless on the streets around westminster cathedral are from overseas but simply stating that fact is not in my view necessarily xenophobic he noted he was reiterating in verbatim form the strength of local opinion he had received from residents and constituents with regards the marked deterioration in and around westminster cathedral piazza he said even as a conservative mp i have made strong representations to the current government about this worsening trend i shall continue to offer my support to the local authorities and charities such as the passage who i recognise do such vital work in our community dan jarvis the labour mp for barnsley central said it was worrying homelessness was becoming increasingly normalised in society he said we should always remember that these are our fellow citizens and choose our words carefully and responsibly the government needs to concentrate on working towards a compassionate and practical solution to eradicate rough sleeping a spokesperson from the labour homelessness campaign said fields comments were disturbing and called on him to resign mark field represents an area with extremely high levels of homelessness he has hundreds of rough sleeping constituents and its extremely disturbing to see what contempt he holds them in westminster deserves better for degrading and threatening the vulnerable people and dedicated charity workers and volunteers in his constituency mark field should resign field has served as mp for cities of london and westminster since in he was appointed a minister of state at the foreign office the mp has taken a different tone when talking about the areas problems in the past in a debate on homelessness tabled by shabana mahmood mp he said i live with my wife and children a stones throw from westminster cathedral and from the passage a charity sponsored predominantly by the roman catholic church that has provided succour for the less fortunate for a century and a half he later said a huge amount of charitable work is done by voluntary groups many of which have grown out of nothing in recent years we should welcome that westminster council has come under fire for boarding up the area in question with campaigners warning that local authorities and police are pushing homeless people out of sight and out of mind a large white hoarding has appeared outside a mcdonalds restaurant in victoria street near carlisle place which homeless people and campaigners say is part of a wider effort to remove rough sleepers from a borough with the largest street population in england cllr ian adams cabinet member for public protection and licensing for westminster city council said the structure had been

men are significantly less likely than women to think that taking time off to look after a child has had a negative impact on their career polling has found according to research by ipsos mori shared with the guardian almost three in women thought that taking maternity leave had a negative impact on their career while less than half the proportion of men noticed the same impact after paternity leave in a survey of adults conducted in june of both parents and nonparents agreed that taking time off work to care for a child has a negative impact on a persons job a similar proportion of men and women agreed with the statement and respectively older people were more likely to agree with more than half of to yearolds doing so and only of to yearolds feeling the same as one of her final acts as prime minister last month theresa may launched a consultation on changes to parental leave entitlements the proposal envisaged a longer period of paternity leave the ipsos mori survey found that only a third of working respondents thought their employer was supportive of shared parental leave with men more likely to feel this way than women versus claire timmins the director of hr at ipsos mori which offers equal time off to new mothers and fathers said the research highlighted the need for employers to address continued inequality in parental leave levels of awareness and understanding of the different policies on offer need to be significantly increased and it is clear that responsibility here lies with employers she said joeli brearley the founder of pregnant then screwed which works against maternity or pregnancy discrimination said taking time off to care for a child was still likely to have a negative impact on a persons job with childrearing being disproportionately done by women it means that mothers are losing out on pay rises and promotions parental leave is just the start of it with the ifs institute of fiscal studies estimating that by the time a womans first child

to survive in the refuge sarah not her real name stores fruit and cereal bars to eat in her room when we first talk in march she has been there for a month after leaving her abusive husband she had been sofa surfing with friends and family for a week while waiting for a place this is standard nowadays research by womens aid in found that of referrals to refuges were declined meaning that women escape abusive homes only to be turned away due to lack of space but because sarah is a disabled abuse victim with several physical illnesses that leave her struggling to walk as well as mental health problems she at least got high priority her husband she explains often used this against her hed say that i ruined his life with my disability that i couldnt cope on my own throughout their marriage she was reliant on him to be her carer a setup that became part of the abuse he typically withdrew care even food or water if she broke one of his many rules and threatened to call mental health services to get her sectioned if she didnt do as he said he was regularly violent forcing her to stop taking antidepressants and other medication while getting angry with me for getting sick so much it was easy to isolate her he would take away her motability car keeping her housebound for days or even weeks on end the refuge has enabled sarah to escape the abuse but she is now in danger in different ways all because the refuge isnt accessible her nearest bathroom is classed as disabled friendly but its a shower over a bath which is difficult for sarah to get into without falling sarah sleeps upstairs better than the groundfloor rooms which had bunk beds she couldnt climb into but theres no lift meaning that it is an enormous effort for her to leave her room getting to the kitchen is a struggle she is eating very little and has lost a lot of weight she has already fallen down the stairs twice since being here sarah stresses how kind staff at the refuge have been to her but it is clear the lack of access on top of everything else is brutal i am at the end of my tether she says im just so tired and desperate the scourge of domestic abuse in britain has received fresh attention in the past few weeks with outrage over the postponement of a domestic violence bill because of the suspension of parliament followed by the news that domestic killings of adults the overwhelming majority of whom were women reached a fiveyear high last year disabled victims such as sarah are at the sharpest edge of this crisis almost one in two disabled women will be a victim of abuse in their lifetime according to research by womens aid making them twice as likely as women without disabilities to experience abuse the charity refuge which runs refuges across local authorities nationwide tells me that onethird of the women it assisted longterm in had one or more disability despite disabled women being significantly more at risk than others there is a notorious lack of provision to help them only one in refuge spaces in the uk are accessible to people with physical disabilities according to a bbc investigation in theres a dearth of services for disabled survivors says ruth bashall the director of stay safe east one of just three specialist services for disabled abuse victims in england and wales it means disabled survivors either turn to mainstream services which try their best but often dont have the skills or facilities to deal with them or they just dont access services at all austerity measures in recent years have only exacerbated this figures obtained under the freedom of information act by the guardian in found that refuges for women and children in england wales and scotland had seen funding cut by m since amounting to an average cut for each refuge of specialist services are often the first to go in womens aid reported that almost of specialist refuges had closed since the coalition gained power in as sarah says the refuge said it themselves the cuts to services mean theyre unable to meet my needs i have been speaking to sarah on and off for the past six months as she tries to rebuild her life navigating her way to secure a regular income coping with her health and finding a safe and accessible place to call home for disabled women fleeing abuse cuts to refuges have combined with budgetslashing across vital services in recent years from mental health care to changes in disability benefits in an era where there is less and less help to go around constantly battling to get the support sarah is entitled to from the state is deeply stressful take the benefit system because she is too unwell to earn a wage sarah relies on the outofwork sickness benefit employment and support allowance but is frantic about being transferred to the scandalplagued universal credit system domestic violence charities and mps had warned that the design of universal credit in which benefits are paid to the main breadwinner was enabling male abusers to withhold money from their victims the government announced a uturn on the rules this year sarahs husband financially abused her throughout their relationship forcing her to lend him over the years all of which came from her benefits he said i owed him because he looked after me she explains he was already falsely receiving carers allowance a benefit paid to people who provide substantial care for a loved one and before she escaped she says he was about to get control of her benefits through her upcoming transfer to universal credit sarah may now be eligible for more support as she is no longer in a couple but in an era of pernicious benefit decisions where people clearly not well enough to work are being told to do so she is too afraid to contact the department for work and pensions in case it risks her other benefits at the same time sarah has to find money for private therapy to help her deal with the trauma she has been through last year she was treated on the nhs after she became suicidal as a result of her abuse but she was only given a dozen sessions she is now on an month waiting list for further nhs counselling she has been seeing a private therapist twice a month to help her keep afloat but i just cant afford it she says without an accessible refuge meanwhile sarahs living arrangements have become increasingly desperate she has tried sneaking into her old university library to sleep a couple of times on other days she spends a lot of time in her car its comfier its warm and its safe she says her cashstrapped local council could only offer her a hostel with men as an alternative when i speak to sarah again in late spring she has been hospitalised with an infection and her mood is even lower what she really needs is someone to advocate on her behalf to help her get the housing healthcare and benefits to which she is entitled but such services are like gold dust now budget cuts are leaving people like me trying to navigate everything she says she has applied to the council for a permanent flat but social housing lists are huge in the meantime she is trying to rent privately its a risky solution research by shelter in found leading letting agents were discriminating against women and disabled people by not accepting housing benefit claimants regardless of whether they could afford the rent i may have found one sarah tells me in may about a flat listing they dont take benefits but im not required to tell them so im hoping it will be ok a few weeks later in june i get an email from sarah the flat has fallen through as she feared the landlord said he couldnt verify her income the domestic violence charity that is helping her has offered a room in another refuge but its up a steep staircase unable to accept it she has been discharged from their books bashall tells me that awareness of the needs of disabled survivors in some circles is increasing for example her organisation currently has home office funding but the climate of wider austerity is creating an evermore dangerous environment the cuts in social care and mental health are pushing more disabled people to depend on their families or partners and increase the risk of abuse she says this month sarah finally has some good news she has found a home the private rental isnt perfect the bathroom is down a set of steps but its the beginning of a fresh start the move has given sarah the confidence to report her husband to the police she says im hoping the end of the nightmare is in sight,2019-09,survive refuge sarah real

a government minister has refused to confirm whether the new domestic abuse bill would ban the crossexamination of victims by alleged perpetrators in court a key provision of the original bill which stalled due to the prorogation of parliament victoria atkins the mp for louth and horncastle and parliamentary undersecretary of state for safeguarding was speaking after the government announced the appointment of nicole jacobs as its first domestic abuse commissioner after a series of warnings from charities that survivors could not wait any longer for critical protections and support atkins was questioned about the contents of the bill and the delays since to preventing such crossexaminations all bills in those early stages fall at prorogation but i am delighted that the prime minister and home secretary have pretty unusually confirmed that the bill will be in the queens speech atkins told bbc radio s today programme at this point in time i am at the limit of time in terms of what i can say about what is in the queens speech about threequarters of the victims of domestic killings of adults are women the number of those killed last year reached a fiveyear high of an increase of on the previous year cashstrapped local authorities have cut spending on refuges by almost m since leading to closures of key support services asked whether reversing the cuts to womens refuges would better help victims of domestic abuse than the creation of a new role without any formal powers atkins said the government had recently consulted on the issue and that funding for refuges was vital the consultation is very much about helping us understand what is available and what more needs to be done she said atkins added that jacobs a former chief executive of the charity standing together against domestic violence would be tasked with mapping the provision and ensuring consistency of services across the uk pressed on what she could achieve in the role atkins said the fact that a commissioner has been appointed i hope will give charities some comfort jacobs said she wanted to end the postcode lottery of services that many victims faced adding that she was relieved the bill would be reintroduced to parliament it was heartening how quickly politicians from all parties were asserting how much they wanted to see the bill in the queens speech and back on track as well as from the public and people in the court system she said the appointment comes after the labour mp jess phillips who has championed the bill said last week domestic abuse victims were simply collateral damage of party politicking she has also criticised how james brokenshire the former communities secretary promised m to fund womens refuges but nothing was confirmed in the recent spending review writing in the sun on wednesday boris johnson said the criminal justice system was built entirely around dealing with the perpetrator and criticised an absence of longterm support for victims he said new measures would be set out this week to help more people challenge unduly lenient sentences speed up plans to enshrine in law the rights that victims of crime deserve and to give survivors of

fellow feminists rejoice according to no less an authority than the treasurer of australia the gender pay gap has closed josh frydenberg said so on monday in question time its in hansard so it must be true job done we can all stop with the timeconsuming advocacy and agitation and just hit the shops to start spending the extra per week were getting in our pay packets now that the government has brought our earnings into line with the blokes hurrah except not so much its not true as minister for women marise payne made clear in the senate the following day the gender pay gap in australia the difference between average fulltime earnings for men and women sits at on the latest figures from the workplace gender equality agency wgea thats definitely a significant reduction from its peak in november when it hit but for more than two decades the pay gap has hovered between and and progress on eliminating it is far too slow announcing the latest statistics on unequal pay day last month the wgea described the gap as stable noting it had hardly shifted at all over the last months and that at the current rate of change closing it completely would take another years so how could the treasurer get his facts so wrong on such a fundamental issue frydenberg clarified his statement the following day saying that the pay gap is at a record low a claim he has subsequently boasted about on twitter isnt this then cause for celebration not really as one of australias foremost experts on gender and work professor rae cooper from the university of sydney noted when the latest statistics were released the reduction in the pay gap over the last five years has coincided with a period of chronically depressed male wages that is a large proportion of the decrease in the pay gap can be attributed to falling average fulltime incomes for men over the last five years a result largely due to the collapse of employment in the mining sector as the end of the boom and a rapid uptake of automation has seen highpaid jobs disproportionately held by men disappear for the treasurer to claim victory over a reduction in the gender pay gap that has largely resulted from lower incomes and fewer jobs for men sounds entirely the wrong note and is clearly at odds with the prime ministers statement on international womens day this year that we dont want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse the fact is the gender pay gap in australia remains stubbornly high but in itself it only tells half the story the pay gap is calculated by comparing average fulltime earnings for men and women across society apples with apples so to speak but the difference in lifetime earnings for men and women in australia which leads to outcomes such as women retiring with less superannuation than men results from more insidious and intractable forces than the difference in fulltime earnings for a start women in australia are far more likely than those in comparable nations to work parttime abs data shows that women make up just of fulltime employees but of parttime employees among oecd nations only in switzerland the netherlands austria and germany are a higher proportion of women working parttime oecd figures also show the employment rate of women in australia aged between and years is in the lower third of oecd countries this is due to the fact that australia is stuck in the male breadwinner model of family income even as women have entered the workforce in huge numbers over the last four decades the neotraditional family structure in which the man works fulltime and the woman only parttime in paid employment while the woman undertakes the majority of unpaid care and domestic labour in the home is the dominant one among australian heterosexual couple households the nature of work in australia is also highly segregated along gender lines the latest data from the workplace gender equality agency wgea demonstrates that the majority of australian employees continue to work in industries dominated by one gender only of employed australians work in gender mixed organisations this has a significant impact on the gender pay gap because professions in which the workforce is dominated by women are significantly underpaid the wgea data conclusively shows that people working in industries with a predominantly female workforce have lower salaries than those working in maledominated industries in short we have a long way to go before we will see the gender pay gap close if we are to get there we need to understand and address the real causes of womens income inequality in australia facing up to the facts about the gender pay gap is the least we can expect of the man in charge of the national economy emma dawson

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday texas cracks down on dick pics big news out of texas this week sending unsolicited penis pictures is now against the law punishable by a fine you might be wondering why texas of all places is leading the charge when it comes to legislation like this the lone star state after all is normally more focused on loosening restrictions on guns than tightening protections for women well its largely because the femalefocused dating app bumble is based in austin and lobbied local politicians to make it happen if indecent exposure is a crime on the streets then why is it not on your phone or computer bumbles founder whitney wolfe herd asked texas lawmakers at a hearing earlier this year we have to call on you because as tech companies we can only do so much legislators agreed and the bill got bipartisan support the cyberflashing act which went into effect last saturday doesnt just apply to men sending dick pics it bans the electronic transmission of unwanted visual material depicting any persons intimate parts as well as the covered genitals of a male person that are in a discernibly turgid state despite its inclusive wording however the law clearly wasnt passed to prevent women sending unsolicited pictures of their vaginas to men because that just isnt a thing although back in a woman called kerry quin decided to send unexpected pictures of a vagina sourced from google to men on bumble she hoped that turning the tables like this would make men see how invasive unwanted dick pics are as it turned out however most of the men were desperate to meet her after the graphic introduction unsolicited dick pics have become a ubiquitous part of modern life a pew research poll for example found that of young women say theyve been sent unwanted explicit images and of women consider online harassment to be a major problem despite this however dick pics are often treated as an amusing cultural phenomenon rather than a serious issue lately it feels like men and women are being told that this increasingly common problem is really no big deal wolfe herd noted to texas lawmakers during hearings about the bill women in particular are expected to laugh this sort of thing off but theres nothing funny about it wolfe herde is right the extent to which women are sexually harassed online is no joke while experts agree that the new texas law will be hard to enforce the simple act of passing a law like this sends an important message its a reminder that unsolicited dick pics should not be considered normal or acceptable encouragingly the uk is also taking steps to criminalize online flashing the law has a long way to go when it comes to tackling digital harassment but at least some small steps are being taken crazy big pay gap adele lim a cowriter on hit romcom crazy rich asians has dropped out of the planned sequels because of a massive pay discrepancy while lim was going to

the government must not allow the prorogation of parliament to further delay the introduction of new domestic abuse laws campaigners have said arguing that survivors cannot wait any longer for critical protections and support attempts to improve the laws relating to domestic abuse have suffered numerous setbacks in recent years proposed changes in legislation to prevent perpetrators crossexamining victims in the family courts were initially included in the prisons and courts bill which was abandoned when theresa may called the general election a number of measures were then included in the domestic abuse bill which was finally introduced to parliament in july this year but charities and campaigners are seeking assurances that the legislation will not be dropped again in the current political turmoil in a letter to the prime minister leading domestic abuse charities academics and human rights organisations called for the government to make a clear public commitment to deliver the bill within the next parliamentary session we are writing to seek assurance that vital legislation to protect survivors of domestic abuse remains a priority for the government the letter reads the domestic abuse bill is a pivotal moment crucially it will enable the uk government to ratify the istanbul convention the landmark international treaty for preventing and combating violence against women among other proposals the bill contains measures to introduce a statutory government definition of domestic abuse which would include economic abuse and the creation of domestic abuse protection notices and domestic abuse protection orders to put restrictions on offenders responding to a question by the mp jess phillips in parliament on tuesday boris johnson said the government would ensure that the domestic abuse bill the animal welfare sentencing bill and other bills receive proper consideration and are rolled over a government spokesperson said the government is absolutely committed to legislating to support victims of domestic abuse the forthcoming queens speech will set out our legislative agenda for the next session of parliament phillips told the guardian that she had been told by wellinformed people that the government was considering dropping the bill you have to look at the language that the government used this week which is that it is in review that they very much expect it to be carried forward she said if the government wants to keep the domestic abuse bill and relaunch it then why wont they just come out and say it the mp for birmingham yardley said the former communities secretary james brokenshire who was sacked by johnson in july had promised m to fund womens refuges but that nothing had been confirmed in this weeks spending review this is about peoples lives she said its not some bloody game the letter was signed by organisations including womens aid refuge imkaan and the centre for womens justice over the past two years survivors frontline specialist services parliamentarians and the organisations listed have provided significant expertise to the development of this legislation to ensure it achieves its full potential they said the organisations stressed that survivors had shared their experiences of domestic abuse with the government and that it was crucial that their courage and determination to improve legal protection for women and children in the future is listened to and acted on the bill has already suffered a number of delays and survivors cannot wait any longer for critical protections and

improvements to the gender pay gap between british men and women have stalled with official figures revealing that the difference widened slightly in among some groups provisional data released on tuesday by the office for national statistics shows that the pay gap for fulltime employees rose to in from the year before although it played down the increase saying it was not statistically significant the ons figures show that since there has been little meaningful change in the gender pay gap with the gulf narrowing by for fulltime employees the most stubborn gap is between men and women when they reach their s where the difference in pay is more than and has not declined significantly over time but among all employees where the figures are affected by the larger number of women who work parttime the gender pay gap narrowed as lowpaid women benefited from increases to the national minimum wage the pay gap for all employees stands at down from the year before ons senior statistician roger smith said the gender pay gap has been falling slowly in recent years for fulltime employees but in it was little changed however for employees under the gap is now close to zero its among older workers that the pay gap remains substantial the ons said one of the reasons for differences in the gender pay gap between age groups is that women over years are more likely to work in lowerpaid occupations and compared with younger women are less likely to work as managers directors or senior officials among the highest paid the gap widened substantially in the ons which relies on a snapshot of of all the pay records at hm revenue amp customs said the gap at the level of managers directors and senior officials rose from to last year when the ons drilled down into individual occupational data major differences emerged male carpenters and joiners earn more than their female equivalents while energy plant operatives are paid more even in professional occupational areas large gaps remain the ons data shows that of all fulltime solicitors are female yet the average female lawyer earns less than her male counterpart the average female chief executive earns while her male equivalent picks up there are also negative gender pay gaps where female employees on average earn more than men for example female physiotherapists earn on average or more than the average male physiotherapist on the ons said the lowest gender pay gap is in archivists and curators and personal assistants and other secretaries separate data from the ons also revealed that overall pay in rose in real terms after adjusting for inflation by in the year to april but it said that median earnings were still lower in real terms than the peak in when the financial crisis

a recent report on domestic violence has been seized upon as proof that domestic violence is not a male problem one of the people leading the charge is joe hildebrand who wrote a piece describing the report as an apparent watershed moment and suggested the commentary surrounding domestic violence is all part of a the deadliest of lies propagated by hysteria and outrage the watershed moment hildebrand is referring to is the latest domestic violence report from the australian institute of criminology unfortunately his ability to analyse the report in its context is marred by either his lack of experience and expertise in this topic or is just reflecting prevailing male attitudes when interpreting results of the report as a doctor who works in this field i feel compelled to correct the misinformation being disseminated by clarifying the report in greater detail the study immediately identifies that reporting rates of violence for women are only about in other words of women who are abused do not report the abuse at all the study also states very early on that the collated data is almost exclusively from police and courts in essence the paper does not represent most cases of domestic violence nevertheless with respect to the population it does cover hildebrand stated there was a massive concentration of domestic violence in disadvantaged and indigenous communities and that alcohol was also a driving factor keeping in mind that this is mostly police data we need to remember that police are much more likely to charge and incarcerate an aboriginal person for all types of crimes police are also more likely to do a blood alcohol level for an indigenous person so the data is skewed with a greater share of indigenous perpetrators it is well established that all forensic data demonstrates an overrepresentation of indigenous people and this is unfortunately no exception it is important to note that those working in the field of domestic violence are very well aware of the specific needs and increased vulnerability of our aboriginal population and continue to advocate very strongly for improved accessibility and treatment for all australians poverty was also raised as being the cause of domestic violence when this is done my interpretation is that it is an attempt to other victims and offenders by suggesting it is an issue only for those with socioeconomic disadvantage while the dataset demonstrates greater numbers of police reports in poorer areas it also included the following nonphysical forms of violence such as shouting provoking arguments and controlling behaviours were found to be more common among offenders with higher levels of education and employment offenders who self report coercive or controlling behaviours were more likely to have completed year or above and to earn per annum or more that changes things a lot its an important distinction to make because while this type of domestic violence is just as harmful it does not result in a charge let alone a conviction coercive control is not illegal therefore one will not obtain this data from police or court reports many victims of coercive control do not recognise the abuse while they are in the relationship or if they do they feel they should not report it because it isnt physical all these elements culminate in the fact that wealthier more educated perpetrators are more likely to get away with family and domestic abuse it means that the data set is skewed heavily towards perpetrators from lower socioeconomic groups and thus needs to be interpreted with caution obscurely the study hildebrand used to prove that prevailing narrative that domestic violence is a male v female issue is a deadly lie reveals that men accounted for between and of all offenders it also acknowledged that most of the female offenders were involved in bidirectional violence a fancy word to state that they were victims too and were violent in retaliation finally and most importantly men accounted for five out of every six domestic violence offences recorded by police hildebrand is privileged to have a platform to speak about any topic regardless of experience or expertise there are many professionals in this area professionals who work with perpetrators and victims within the health system legal system or as academics in criminology it is a pity he did not enlist their assistance to avoid himself spreading the deadliest of lies this issue does impact all men from all walks of life not just the povertystricken dr karen williams is a consultant

monday i work in a domestic abuse team for an lgbt charity i never really know what to expect when i come in to work whether its offering talking therapy or providing substance abuse services no one day is the same the first person arrives and i do an assessment with questions on past sexual abuse injuries and criminal records so i can determine how to help the questions are looking at the current risk to the person from the alleged perpetrator and cover all forms of abuse such as physical emotional financial and controlling and coercive behaviours the way people contact us varies some are referred by gps others by mental health charities the most serious cases tend to come to our dropin services as a final call for help tuesday today i meet daniel he initially came to the charity as a survivor of domestic abuse his confidence was low and he had severe trust issues in our sessions we discuss the meaning of love and relationships i try to understand what these concepts mean to daniel the idea of becoming close to someone either emotionally or sexually terrifies him having been so vulnerable in the past daniel has constructed many barriers together we attempt to break them down in one of our sessions it emerges that daniel witnessed domestic abuse at home while growing up many studies suggest that experiencing this trauma will have a lasting impact on the childs future relationships while helping survivors is an essential part of the charity domestic abuse prevention is even more important daniel and i work together on a series of exercises such as consent workshops and anger management activities these ensure people will not be at risk of committing domestic violence because of their past wednesday lucy a trans woman escaped an abusive relationship but was denied access to a womens refuge because she was seen as a threat to other women in greater manchester there is only one refuge which has accepted a trans female many refuges will not accept trans women or male victims of domestic abuse for many like lucy staying with family is not an option individuals can become estranged as a result of their sexual or gender identity staying in a hostel or bampb can also be problematic due to the homophobic and transphobic abuse people receive some past clients have had things thrown at them while others have experienced hate crimes and been physically attacked i see someone in the afternoon who has been deliberately infected with hiv by his partner he was forced to have unprotected sex by his abuser who stopped him from visiting a sexual health clinic now his health is in an extremely fragile state thursday in the middle of a dropin appointment my client who has experienced domestic abuse tells me they want to kill themselves i call a colleague in while i ring an ambulance ive noticed over the past few years that the number of people turning to us for crisis support is increasing as is the level of service users with complex needs friday i meet billie a client who is going to testify in court the process is emotionally taxing to make it slightly easier we provide counselling services and special support for billie this includes a pretrial visit to the court so its less intimidating on the day despite our efforts many victims drop out before the trial recently the person i was helping dropped charges because of threats and harassment from their partners family before the hearing you learn not to let this job affect you once people arrive at our charity i tend not to worry because i know we can help them what keeps me up at night is knowing that so many individuals are trapped in abusive relationships unable to seek help in the uk samaritans can be contacted on or email josamaritansorg in the us the national suicide prevention lifeline is in australia the crisis support service lifeline is other international suicide helplines can be found at wwwbefriendersorg if you would like to contribute to our my working

davina jameshanman rightly identifies austerity policies including legal aid cuts as contributing to an average of three women a week being killed by their partners or former partners theres no secret abusers handbook its called mainstream culture october however i wonder if she has considered the devastating impact of the illconsidered domestic violence crime and victims act which made breach of a family civil court nonmolestation injunction a criminal offence implemented in this egregious example of a law of unintended consequences actually weakened the protection such orders afforded victims by prohibiting judges from attaching powers of arrest prior to this when an applicant reported breach the police had only to arrest the respondent and return him to court the next working day for immediate contempt proceedings with up to two years custody for breach of orders were obeyed providing essential calm while the court resolved the issues keeping victims trapped longterm living arrangements finance divorce and crucially children now on breach victims lose the courts protection and their legal aid to rely on criminal proceedings if there is enough evidence and if they can face these as a former practising family law solicitor now sitting on my local police and crime commissioners domestic abuse scrutiny panel i see police struggle to meet victims needs desperate to safely end abusive relationships when most deaths occur victims rarely find criminal proceedings helpful which is why civil protection was first developed and why the new criminal bill is likely to make little difference letting family judges again attach powers of arrest to their protective orders would be a sensible and significant step towards reducing the numbers of domestic killings jan williams the campaign for effective domestic abuse laws your article on rosie duffields harrowing commons account of domestic abuse highlights the importance of the draft domestic abuse bill mp leaves commons in tears with moving domestic abuse story october sadly domestic abuse is still a widespread problem throughout england and wales with an estimated million adults aged to suffering domestic abuse in the year ending march office for national statistics the bill has the potential to change millions of lives and many of its proposals such as creating a domestic abuse commissioner prohibiting the crossexamination of victims by their alleged abuser and widening the definition of domestic abuse are long overdue however for the bill to be effective in protecting victims the government must put the necessary funding into legal aid support services education and wider government policy we urge the government to carry the domestic abuse bill over into the next parliamentary

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday area woman has haircut i regret to inform you that alexandria ocasiocortez derangement syndrome aocds has struck again the condition characterized by an unhealthy obsession with the new york congresswoman and an inability to stop foaming at the mouth claimed reporters at the washington times this week on wednesday the conservative outlet published an exclusive story headlined selfdeclared socialist aoc splurges on highdollar hairdo in actual fact as the internet swiftly pointed out ocasiocortezs cut and coloring were not actually that highdollar womens haircuts are incredibly expensive being a woman is incredibly expensive dunno if youve heard of this little thing called the pink tax whats more spending money on a haircut is not incompatible with being a socialist conservatives seem to think that if you want to tax billionaires and make the world a more equitable place you ought to live in a dirt hut and refuse to participate in modern society last year for example a reporter for the washington examiner tried to insinuate that aoc was a hypocrite by posting a photo of her wearing a nice jacket and coat the subtext being that you cant call yourself a real socialist unless you dress in rags while conservatives crow about selfdeclared socialists getting haircuts they are rather more tightlipped about the trump administrations spending habits indeed aoc responded to hairgate by tweeting a story about mike pence spending almost in limo service for an unnecessary detour to trumps irish resort in doonbeg you know the one that was miles away from pences meetings in dublin mike pence used taxpayer funds not personal ones to spend several thousand haircuts worth of public money on a visit to trump golf courses ocasiocortez tweeted i wonder if republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a womans cut amp color i think we all know the answer to that question the todo about aocs do isnt just yet another example of republican hypocrisy however its also a depressing reminder that being a woman means being forced to walk an impossible tightrope everyday youre criticized if you dont look good but youre also criticized if you look too good youre either a slut or a prude youre told to lean in and speak up at work but youre called a bossy bitch if you speak up too much women simply cant win when they play by the patriarchys rules which is why we need to stop playing by the patriarchys rules and lean all the way out exclusive new aoc scandals revealed this constant stream of aoc controversies is getting incredibly tedious so you know what im going to save the rightwing media some time and write a few preemptive headlines for them bloody hypocrite supposed socialist aoc uses luxury tampons rather than stuffing leaves in her underwear hot air ocasiocortez wants green new deal but caught shamelessly using heating during the winter call yourself a commie aoc buys new phone rather than contacting people via freerange carrier pigeon revealed ocasiocortez eats at a restaurant instead of foraging for edible plants in dc parkland elizabeth warren

davina jameshanman has only met one selfaware murderer its not that they are generally monsters they are often personable and likeable and that is how they have been able to abuse women she says but selfawareness thats a rarer commodity among the men and it is overwhelmingly men who now kill their partners or expartners in the uk at a rate of three every week she met the exception to the rule after he had been in prison for months by then he was really owning what hed done generally she says men who kill their partners are still defensive still in denial and they still want you to accept that she was asking for it for more than three decades jameshanman has fought to protect survivors of domestic violence her career which started in a womens refuge in the late s has included stints running a major charity advising the government and eight years in charge of strategy for the mayor of london until boris johnson fired her more of which later as a consultant on violence against women she now devotes much of her time to women whose time has run out since every domestic murder has triggered a domestic homicide review dhr this is a detailed multiagency inquiry into the circumstances of the victims life and death and their contact with agencies and services jameshanman who has completed more than dhrs for the home office says it forces you to ask what would have made a difference she applies to each review the lessons of a frontline career in a sector that barely existed when she started she talks to police officers doctors and local authorities as well as the grieving family and friends she searches victims social media accounts occasionally i get to read their diary she adds she also writes to the killers about a third agree to meet her her workload is huge two days before we meet the bbc publishes new domestic abuserelated homicide data in people were killed the highest number for five years the perpetrators were predominantly male from to of domestic homicide victims were women and of male victims were killed by other men well did you think austerity was going to have no consequences jameshanman asks if anything im surprised it has taken this long for the numbers to go up women are calling the police and they are not turning up or abusers are breaching bail and not being arrested legal aid has been cut she says women are turned away from refuges because they are full money for prevention work has all but dried up this stuff makes a difference the figures came out three days after theresa may as the departing prime minister awarded a knighthood to geoffrey boycott jameshanman listened to the today programme on bbc radio when boycott lashed out at presenter martha kearney for daring to ask about his conviction in a french court for repeatedly punching his then girlfriend margaret moore which he still denies i dont give a toss about her love he said of the chief executive of womens aid who had described his knighthood as extremely disappointing what was she thinking jameshanman asks of mays decision to honour boycott when abusers say they should have anonymity until they are convicted because otherwise it would ruin their careers you can say well you can get convicted and then knighted its depressing because it reminds you how far there is to go only weeks before boycotts knighthood may had announced a domestic violence bill to which the prime minister boris johnson has now expressed his full commitment it fell when he prorogued parliament in september jameshanman is positive about some of the measures in mays bill it would place new statutory duties on councils among other things but says they ring hollow after a decade of austerity her cynicism could be forgiven murder is the worst result of a flawed system one in four women will experience domestic abuse of some kind in their life protecting them has been her lifes work after a conservative upbringing in a military family jameshanman remembers a formative school trip to an exhibition about the suffragettes learning about them was electrifying this group of really badly behaved women she says as a history student at the university of east anglia she was struck while volunteering at a free pregnancy testing service in norwich by how many women were checking their reproductive status as part of decisionmaking about an abusive relationship jameshanmans first paid job was at a refuge in hillingdon west london this was the late s and domestic abuse murders were not even added up officially jameshanman still remembers the sole civil servant who looked at national policy geoffrey marriage he had a beard you could hide a badger in police forces meanwhile would typically assign women officers who were new mothers to domestic cases because the hours were easier when the refuge applied to social services to fund summer activities for the children it housed we were turned down by a female committee chair on the grounds that we were encouraging feckless women to leave loving husbands she laughs sardonically even in the late s feckless was quite an antediluvian word we used to say domestic violence was everywhere but nowhere because it was nobodys focus she adds but soon the sector would learn from emerging american multiagency approaches including health and education as well as police and the criminal justice system in jameshanman became britains first local authority domestic violence coordinator in islington among other measures the london borough placed crisis intervention workers in police stations after the labour government pumped money into the sector the crime and disorder act offered local authorities and police forces central funding if they hit new crime targets creating a financial incentive to tackle domestic violence in the new mayor ken livingstone asked jameshanman to develop the citys first domestic violence strategy attempting to unite the womens sector police and boroughs was a major challenge she says i went home and cried every day she kept banging heads together until days after johnson was elected mayor in he dismissed her by letter he eventually announced his own strategy the new focus and funding were pivotal but fraught as the sector became more professional faultlines opened between the women who had started it as a feminist movement many were themselves survivors and a new generation of professionals who had followed the money the priority became prosecution and the highestrisk cases which neglected victims of coercive control and other forms of abuse then came austerity in coercive control became a crime but we still neglect the root causes of abuse jameshanman says they permeate a society in which wife beating is viewed as an inevitability even a punchline in the early days i used to have paranoid fantasies that there was some kind of secret abusers handbook she says so similar were the stories victims brought to refuges eventually i realised that there is and its not secret at all its called mainstream culture jameshanman sees it in her homicide reviews and in prisons she meets men who fear losing the power that comes with a rigid belief in traditional gender roles men who repackage girly emotions such as insecurity stress and fear as anger often they are not feeling anger at all but thats the only safe emotion to feel because if they stop believing in gender roles their whole world starts to crumble she says substance abuse and financial stresses dont help progress means more women now recognise abuse and get out of toxic relationships sooner but when a woman becomes a mother the power balance in a couple changes jameshanman draws a direct link to the inequities of parental leave violence against women is a cause and consequence of womens inequality she says repeating a mantra in the sector she has seen the pernicious effect of technology too abusers now use video calling so they can see which rooms their partners are in and put satellite trackers in their cars also pornography is ubiquitous and fills a gap in young minds that should be filled with learning about relationships for years until jameshanman ran the against violence and abuse charity when she worked with the home office on its this is abuse campaign she moderated the teenage chatrooms some of them were just she drops her jaw things like my boyfriend made me give a blowjob in front of his mates is this abuse in the recent homicide review of shana grice who was murdered by her exboyfriend in jameshanman noted that the prevailing culture among young people in which teenage girls face an endless bombardment of messages that inform them they are valued for how they look means harassment is often minimised normalised or even rationalised as romance there are morbid patterns in the murders themselves stabbing is now the preferred method for killers while homicide rates are up in the uk they are in longterm decline in most countries there is a very depressing theory which id rather not believe that this is down to progress in medicine jameshanman says what she means is that women are dying less frequently because surgeons elsewhere have become better at repairing stab wounds jameshanman clings to a sense of momentum while she lobbies for a strategy that properly considers the complex causes of domestic violence she remains driven by fascination with her subject and a sense of justice she is able to switch off she has a longterm partner and creates mosaics making something beautiful out of broken pieces and when she completes a homicide review it isnt the murderer she remembers for months she will have immersed herself in the victims life in search of lessons its a very intimate process but it does create a sense of loss she says i frequently feel as if i have lost a friend,2019-10,davina jameshanman ha met one selfaware murderer generally monster often personable likeable able abuse woman

when paul and caroline roberts had their first child almost two years ago paul was determined to do more at home than his own father who had worked hour days seven days a week i never saw him and i didnt want it to be like that for my son paul says as soon as he arrived i knew i wanted to be with him every moment i could paul works in a factory in the north of england where he lives with his wife caroline an accountant for a large organisation they dont want to be more specific for fear of jeopardising their careers they have also protected their real names the roberts had heard about shared parental leave spl the policy introduced in that allows eligible parents to split maternity leave caroline was keen because she worried about taking too much time away from her career but the familys wish to share her leave soon hit bureaucratic financial and cultural brick walls why would you want to stay at home paul remembers incredulous male colleagues asking application forms for spl were not circulated alongside those for maternity or paternity leave and the human resources department was unhelpful sharing the leave would also have made the family poorer caroline earns more than paul and her employers maternity package is relatively generous had she transferred a chunk of it to paul under spl it would have dropped to the statutory minimum of a week two weeks after the birth of his son paul went back to the factory it was bad i felt really down he says i missed my boy caroline resented it too as well as managing lifechanging new circumstances at home alone she later had to pass up a promotion that would have clashed with the end of her maternity leave spl which seemed so progressive at its launch has turned out to be messier than a toddlers dinner it began as an alternative to maternity leave which at the statutory minimum entitles a mother to weeks off work of which are paid of earnings for six weeks then for weeks and paternity leave two weeks at per week under spl a mother must take two weeks of maternity leave after the birth but can move to spl for the remaining weeks of which are paid a couple can share those weeks either taking half in turn alternating blocks or say weeks together the criteria for claiming include a minimum length of employment with the same company and an eightweek notice period agency contract workers or the selfemployed are not eligible employers are required to grant shared leave to eligible staff who apply for it and pay them reclaiming it from the government by way of reduced national insurance contributions got it as the roberts found the complexity of spl has been part of the reason parents arent rushing to take it and employers arent racing to offer it earlier this year the government launched a m share the joy campaign in an attempt to boost uptake of as little as meanwhile research published in august by the law firm emw based on claims filed by businesses with hmrc suggests that less than a third of fathers take statutory twoweek paid paternity leave a figure that is in decline for the modern generation fatherhood is being expressed in totally different ways from before says hanson lee a digital marketer whose experience he struggled to get decent leave when he became a father partly inspired him to launch the parenting website daddilife but the vast majority of workplaces havent caught up and dads are still expected to follow the stereotype of being at work is the priority campaigners describe a vicious cycle even wellintentioned couples submit to a deterrent climate unwittingly perpetuating low expectations and poor policy in workplaces men are too often tacitly or explicitly discouraged from taking leave and so many dads are given grunt work for daring to challenge norms lee adds one anonymous father recalls the macho congratulations his colleague at a bank received on returning to his desk the day after leaving the labour ward when david freed was an economist in the public sector in london he had no problem arranging shared leave when he and his wife charlotte had a son in charlotte took five months off her job in finance after which david took seven months he felt lucky but noticed a change when he got back i got the message i was doing something a bit weird that might affect my career freed says theyd say when you became a dad your priorities seemed to lie elsewhere well yeah but when i was at work i was at work nothing had changed bad policy has farreaching implications earlier this year researchers from georgetown university in washington dc studied the way having children traditionalised couples division of labour delaying the second half of the gender revolution in the home long after women have made huge advances in education and the workforce even in countries with spl women still do more in the home when children arrive only one policy appeared to nudge the balance a form of enhanced paternity leave known as a fathers quota a chunk of leave that a couple loses unless the father takes it among the couples in the study of countries practised a modern division of labour without the fathers quota and with it just over a year ago freed and his family left the uk after charlotte got a job in sweden a fathers quota trailblazer today couples in sweden have one leave policy they are entitled to a total of days of leave days of which are paid at of salary within that total each parent has a useorlose quota of days the remaining days of the day total can be shared as a result fathers have been taking steadily bigger chunks of the total leave period up to in quotas versions of which exist in norway and iceland have critics and gender gaps persist in these countries but they have transformed family life from the playground up during the week there are probably more dads out with babies than mums freed says in workplaces it is assumed that new fathers will disappear for months not days freed was amazed to observe parents routinely dashing from meetings to nursery pickups at pm without judgment if there is a culture of presenteeism in sweden it exists at home not work freed whose experience in england inspired him to write dads dont babysit towards equal parenting alongside fellow frustrated father james millar has noticed swedish dads are better at sharing childrearing responsibilities as well as daytoday duties if a father invites him to a playdate hell get straight back in the uk wed be like yeah let me just ask my wife its a huge cultural difference and it takes pressure off mums to be responsible for everything he says shared leave or lack of it has also been linked to gender pay gaps which widen drastically when women have children the gaps never close partly because mothers are much more likely to work parttime while families grapple with domestic logistics childcare costs and the selfperpetuating pay gap itself which means it tends to make financial sense for fathers to work more the uk government at least recognises there is a problem while also challenging its purported scale the department for business energy and industrial strategy said in a statement that spl uptake is in the range it estimated when it launched to we are consulting on options for how we may better balance the gender division of parental leave and pay the statement added that consultation launched in july by theresa may envisages longer leave for dads were not sending fathers the correct message when our current leave allowances give women times more leave than men the former prime minister wrote in the guardian at the time any improvements will need to catch up with a changing workforce dozens of companies are already acting just a year after the insurance company aviva offered parents of either gender weeks of leave on full pay of eligible fathers were taking more than two weeks and took six months average paternity leave leapt from two to weeks netflix ibm and twitter also have packages that wouldnt look out of place in stockholm but these are corporate giants who can cover empty desks and for whom progressive benefits are as much recruitment and marketing tools as they are ethical advances if youre a startup and lose your only salesperson for three months you have a much bigger problem says matt bradburn cofounder of londonbased people collective which advises startups on human resources founders while typically socially progressive are often childless young men who continue to see statutory leave as the standard bradburn adds when companies grow and age they now tend to enhance paternity leave to avoid the complexities of spl another criticism of the policy campaigners want the government to better support smaller companies who want to offer enhanced leave for the selfemployed now a record of the workforce having children costs the most selfemployed mothers can apply for a week of maternity allowance for weeks equivalent to a year fathers get nothing the government consultation excludes selfemployed parents because of the flexibility and autonomy they have over the time they take off but flexibility doesnt pay the bills sometimes bad policy can trigger horrific chains of events and unexpected solutions william not his real name had to fight for two weeks off after the birth of his first child he told his boss that a complication in pregnancy would require a caesarean and a long recovery for his wife and son well get someone else to help my boss said havent you got a motherinlaw we didnt recovery for mothers after a

his job he stayed at home to care for his family for as long as his finances allowed then he retrained as a nursery worker his income has plummeted and as a rare man in childcare hes battling the stereotypes and stigma that imbalanced parenting can perpetuate ive had everything from paedo to what do you know about children he says while trying to be positive about progress if not the speed of

this isnt happening anymore and it was a real wakeup call to all of us to go oh my goodness it really is harding who chairs nhs improvement which oversees nhs trusts explained the campaign is not focused on the gender pay gap which tends to highlight a lack of women in top roles instead efforts will be focused on ending gender pay discrimination where women are paid less than male colleagues in the same roles the case that sparked the campaign centred around banker stacey macken who won an employment tribunal case against her employer bnp paribas in a rare public victory for equal pay macken claimed she was discriminated against because of her gender after finding she was paid significantly less than a male coworker with the same job title macken was recruited on an annual salary of less than the offered to a male colleague recruited into the same position months later that colleague took home in bonuses over the next five years which was seven times more than the combined offered to macken the metoopay efforts launched on wednesday with an advert in the financial times that read we wish to say to stacey macken and all other professional women whose compensation is tainted by discrimination we are on your side pay discrepancy concerns were also renewed this week after a report found signs of resentment from professionals who have dismissed gender diversity as a matter of political correctness helena morrissey head of personal investing at legal amp general investment management said the pay gap data was both depressing and galvanising harding personally recalls being castigated by one of her previous employers after asking for a pay rise i felt most angry because i found out through adhoc gossip that i was paid less than my male colleagues harding admits she may not have dealt with the information properly but said her bosses were also illequipped to handle the issue she said the feedback i had was how dare you and i dont think my allmale bosses knew how to handle a woman asking for it either both sides were lacking in the skills to have that conversation according to harding bosses are often blinded by unconscious bias and may end up giving a pay rise to men who feel confident enough to ask for one while failing to raise pay for a talented young woman in the same role who hopes to be recognised for her work alone we have to compensate for that harding said but added that women also need to be trained to negotiate harding greene and fellow campaigners have launched a website to serve as a hub for action where supporters can stay up to date on the latest stories around pay discrimination hear about key court cases and get advice from compensation and negotiation experts the campaign comes two years after the metoo movement started to raise the profile of sexual harassment and discrimination against women stacey macken told the guardian i am grateful for the growing network of strong women who are not afraid to speak out and support other women through metoopay,2019-10,uk successful woman launched campaign end pay discrimination shocked detail female banker employment battle metoopay campaign ha brought

more than people aged to suffered domestic abuse in england and wales in one year according to new figures from age uk which warned that the total could be higher due to unrecorded abuse the charity revealed that one in four victims of recorded domestic homicides were over the age of it said it feared for the safety of thousands more due to peoples reluctance or inability to report abuse by loved ones or carers the national crime survey does not record data for people over the age of so many older people were not included in the figures age uk said theres a widespread misconception that domestic abuse only happens to younger people but sadly hundreds of thousands of older people are affected too said caroline abrahams age uks charity director its high time that this was fully recognised by the law policy and practice so that the needs of older survivors can be identified and properly met the report is being launched on the same day that the domestic abuse bill will receive its second reading in parliament in their report age uk calls for the final version of the bill that will form part of the queens speech to include the views and needs of older people in age uk said it received enquiries relating to domestic abuse via its advice line national data for shows that more than people aged to experienced domestic abuse in england and wales using data from the crime survey for england and wales age uk found that two in three older victims of domestic violence were female and four in five perpetrators were male older people were almost equally likely to be killed by a partner or spouse as they were by their adult children or grandchildren laura has endured abuse by her husband henry not their real names throughout their marriage fifty seven years of marriage people say congratulations what an achievement if only they knew she said his memory has started to fail now and he gets frustrated and angr thankfully problems with his hip mean he cant manage the stairs anymore so he sleeps downstairs and allows me to sleep upstairs nighttime is my favourite part of the day i can rest knowing he cant get to me and feel safe for the first time in years i lie in bed and my thoughts are completely my own the report which is backed by the womens aid foundation said older survivors of domestic abuse could face significant barriers when asking for help or when trying to leave an abusive relationship these barriers can be severe for survivors who have been subject to years of prolonged abuse are isolated within a particular community through language or culture are experiencing longterm health impacts or disabilities or those who are reliant on their abuser for their care or money abrahams said adina claire the acting cochief executive of womens aid said domestic abuse can happen to any woman regardless of age we know however that some older women might not recognise their experience as domestic abuse or may find it difficult to ask for help because they are dependent on their abuser we welcome age uks recommendations for the domestic abuse bill such as collecting data on all ages and embedding policy and practice across health and social care which will transform the support provided to older survivors improving and saving lives it is vital that their needs are considered in this legislation prior to the crime survey only asked people up to yearsold if they were experiencing domestic violence the home office said that age limit wasnt removed completely because testing showed the proportion of people answering the question decreased significantly for those aged and over a home office spokesperson said this government is committed to tackling violence against older people like other forms of abuse attacks on older people are all too often hidden behind closed doors and so tackling it requires a collective effort we have appointed a designate domestic abuse commissioner to provide public leadership on domestic abuse issues and play a key role in overseeing and monitoring provision of domestic abuse services in england and wales,2019-10,people aged suffered domestic abuse england wale one year according new figure age uk

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday welcome to america where nipples are more regulated than guns it started with diy and ended with criminal charges a couple of years ago tilli buchanan and her husband were installing drywall in their utah garage the couple got covered in itchy insulation material she later told reporters so they both took their tops off at that point her three stepchildren a yearold boy a yearold girl and a nineyearold boy walked in the kids were mortified buchanan told them not to be this isnt a sexual thing she remembers saying i should be able to wear exactly what my husband wears you shouldnt be embarrassed about this the kids birth mother didnt take quite such a blas view of the incident and complained to authorities criminal charges were filed against buchanan under utah law a woman is guilty of lewdness involving a child if she exposes the part of her breast below the top of the areola in public or in a private place under circumstances the person should know will likely cause affront or alarm if convicted she faces jail time and may have to register as a sex offender for years alongside rapists and pedophiles the judge is expected to rule on the case in the next few months the idea that being topless in your own home might land you in jail is outrageous and the american civil liberties union of utah has intervened in buchanans case earlier this week they asked a judge not just to dismiss the case but to change the states lewdness law which they argue is unconstitutional and discriminates against women theres part of this law that says this part of a woman is found inherently obscene and this part of a man isnt an aclu attorney told reporters outside court on tuesday that really sets up an unequal and unfair dichotomy it should be noted by the way some of the key facts of this case are in dispute buchanan says she was topless in the garage when the kids came in the prosecution alleges she stripped in front of her stepchildren after stating that if it was ok for her husband to take his top off she should be able to do the same its perfectly possible that buchanan may have exercised poor judgment its perfectly possible she isnt entirely blameless in all this but that doesnt detract from the wider point womens chests are sexualized and policed while mens chests arent this hasnt always been the case it wasnt legal for men to be topless in public in new york until the s theres been a growing global movement to free the nipple and get society social media and the law to treat men and womens chests equally the movement has clocked up several victories six states colorado wyoming utah new mexico kansas or oklahoma recently got rid of their bans on women being topless in public the movement is bigger than breasts its about treating female bodies like human bodies not sex objects its about bodily autonomy buchanans case isnt just an explicit example of the double standards applied to male and female bodies it underscores just how out of whack americas priorities are the right to bear arms is considered sacred the right to bare breasts is considered obscene in utah which has some of the most permissive firearm laws in america you can buy a handgun without a background check you can openly carry a handgun without a permit you can go grocery

highest femicide rates in europe and there is a growing public outcry over the problem i think french society is deeply sexist and its difficult to make it evolve the countrys gender equality minister told cnn with the government im trying to win a cultural battle against sexism and misogyny but its true that its very hard majority of murdered irish women killed by male partners eightseven per cent of irish women killed between and know their killer according to a new report by womens aid sixtyone per cent of those women died in their own homes and were killed by a current or former male partner

attitudes towards paternity leave have drastically changed in america in the last five years as more fathers feel comfortable taking extended time off but gender stereotypes persist when it comes to career prospects and the home according to a new study of working parents research by the boston college center for work amp family which surveyed new parents at four large us companies who were eligible for at least six weeks paid parental leave found that of the employees surveyed said the notion of fathers taking leave has become more acceptable of those surveyed of fathers took the maximum amount of time off and of mothers and around threequarters of workers said their employer was equally supportive of mothers and fathers taking parental leave and over half said leave policies had made workplace culture better the us is one of only three countries in the world not to offer statutory paid leave but increasingly states and companies are starting to take up the issue so far eight states and the district of columbia have their own paid family leave laws brad harrington executive director of the center and lead author of the study estimates only to of companies in the us offers paid parental leave he said it reflects a pronounced change in corporate attitudes to new fathers taking time off having done the study on paternity leave five years ago these numbers were shocking to me i did not expect of people to say the organisation finds dads taking this leave acceptable and threequarters to say its equally supportive of women and men he said the study found that nearly threequarters of fathers saw two to four weeks as an appropriate duration for paternity leave and said they would prefer not to take all their time off at once since then there have been a number of legal cases against companies involving paternity leave including against jpmorgan chase and este lauder which have helped put pressure on companies to make their parental leave policies gender neutral however the study also shows how traditional gender roles endure both at work where more women than men reported changes in their perceived career potential and at home even among workers who claim to aspire to equality the vast majority of men said one of the top reasons to take leave was to share caregiving with their partner but when they were asked about how caregiving and household tasks were divided their answers painted a different picture while about of employees said both genders should give the same amount of care the majority of men and nearly half of women admitted that in reality the female actually did most of it a tiny fraction of men said they do more of the childcare men and womens experiences of the return to work following parental leave was also considerably different of the women surveyed reported a downturn in their job satisfaction while said it increased in comparison of men said their job satisfaction went down and said it went up meanwhile more women reported an increase in their responsibilities and manager expectations after birth half of the women said they used flexible work arrangements after becoming a parent while just of men did similar percentages of men and women said they enjoyed their careers and that it gave them a sense of achievement while around half of women and of men said it was a key part of their identity on the subject of career advancement of women and of men said leave could be limiting and both genders said they feared it would have an impact on their progression longterm but on opportunity for promotion more than double the number of women compared to of men believed their chances to be lower after becoming a parent despite progress the struggle for women to reach the highest rungs of power is demonstrated in this years fortune list which featured a record female ceos but still represents a tiny fraction of the total harrington said culture change depends on companies putting more focus on men and their responsibilities by that i mean give men paternity leave encourage men to take time off to be with their kids early on in the kids life recognise that men have to make significant adjustments when they become parents and so dont do all these things to enhance womens advancement and then turn around and say oh but we dont expect the men to take up the slack in may the american civil liberties union aclu and outten amp golden llp announced a historic classaction m settlement with jpmorgan chase on behalf of male employees who claim they were illegally denied access to paid parental leave derek rotondo filed the discrimination charge after he was allegedly told by his hr department that mothers were considered primary caregivers eligible for weeks paid parental leave while fathers were eligible for just two weeks the father of two from columbus ohio who still works at the company as an associate and investigator said he has witnessed a domino effect across companies since the settlement but that there is still substantial progress to be made towards changing attitudes towards paternity leave i do think theres still some way to go theres still going to be sort of the expectation even if its tacit for new dads to essentially come right back to work but i think the research is showing thats starting to change he said equal

as jess phillipss still much mourned parliamentary colleague jo cox once asserted there is very often far more that unites us rather than divides us how right phillips was to effect a meeting with the citizen who had attacked her office when she might have been forgiven for never having wished to see or hear of him ever again fighting for progress from within the party is the only way to do it focus to give up on him or anyone is to give up just a little more on essential efforts at inclusiveness and mutual understanding a sharing of common human experience and respect for often uncomfortable differences are signs of strength and resilience in our at present far too divided communities to exchange contrasting and even conflicting visions of how life should be lived is the hallmark of any mature society a constant striving for inclusivity and tolerance is a crucial building block malcolm fowler kings heath birmingham corbyns credentials rachel botsman writes about trust

last met five years ago the week standard is vital for people waiting for many types of elective surgery including those waiting in pain for hip knee and other joint replacements in those months of

george osborne celebrate the end of austerity but the new cash must be spent wisely admittedly he did have important support from the international monetary fund and the oecd when he declared in that austerity measures were the only way to bring the deficit under control but by january things had changed significantly it was then that the imfs chief economist olivier blanchard told the then chancellor of the need for a reassessment of fiscal policy less than two months before the march budget his recent work on fiscal multipliers had shown him the devastating effects tax and spending cuts were having on the wider economy but did the arrogant osborne take any notice what we saw was the growth forecast for halved and debt as a share of gdp increase from to while government department budgets were cut by in each of the following two years bn further cuts were earmarked for corporation tax cut to and the cap on public sector pay extended for another two years osborne

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday the gender wars are heating up are you a victim of thermal bullying does your partner or roommate always get their way when it comes to how hot your house is if you answered yes then stay strong youre not alone according to a new study conducted by researchers from ohio state university a lot of households contain a thermostat dictator who rules the temperature dial with an iron fist as it turns out theres a gendered nature to this the thermostat dictator is normally a man the study thermostat wars the roles of gender and thermal comfort negotiations in household energy use behavior examined temperature discussions in ohio households they found that men tend to get their way while women are more likely to be forced to compromise its possible that women are losing the thermostat battle the studys lead author told cnn this hints at a status quo gender bias in thermostat settings that leads to a home thermal environment that does not cater to womens preferences womens preferences by the way tend to veer towards warmer environments while men prefer it chilly there is actually a fascinating scientific reason for this it is because men are from mars where its normally a cool f while women are from venus a toasty f temperature is about more than just comfort studies show that women are more productive and perform better on math and verbal tasks in warmer temperatures however as you may have noticed yourself most offices are freezing catering to mens preferred temperatures according a study the optimal office climate has been tailored to the work clothing and metabolic rates of a pound yearold man while there has been a fair amount of research and discussion around sexist airconditioning in the workplace this latest study is the first to focus on household temperature settings it should be noted of course that the sample size was pretty small so the findings arent exactly definitive and its also worth noting that living in a singlesex household isnt a failsafe way to end the thermostat wars my otherwise perfect girlfriend likes to sleep in morguelike

hall spent years in jail she was sentenced to let me repeat that she served more than seven times as long in prison for his crime she only got out of prison last weekend oklahoma its worth noting has

claim labour will close the gender pay gap by background the labour party is pledging to get rid of the gap between the pay of male and female workers it cites a mean gap of between fulltime employees the package of measures behind this includes a real living wage of an hour national pay scales for jobs that are predominantly done by women and extending gender pay reporting to all companies with more than workers reality figures from the office for national statistics are for the median pay gap which is not skewed as much by very high or very low earners they show for fulltime workers the gap is and has only fallen by percentage points since at that rate it would take more than labours year targettime to close but the proposed measures are similar to those called for by equality campaigners the fawcett society wants more employers to pay the living wage and better rewards for jobs typically staffed by women it has also recommended reform to parental leave and mandatory equal pay audits labours plans include extending free childcare and fines for companies that fail to reach equality however it is not clear when either would start one reason women take home less than men is that they are more likely to do parttime jobs when these roles are included the pay gap is labours childcare pledge offers hours a week which does not cover a fulltime role but would make one more financially viable rene adams professor of finance at the sad business school at oxford university said the target was very ambitious there is no way that is achievable adams said that despite paygap reporting there was still a lack of transparency allowing people in the same jobs to be paid different salaries she added that a lack of clear data on why people leave jobs or fail to progress into higher paid jobs made it hard to address all of the issues sam smethers chief executive of the fawcett society said that the pay gap could only be closed by if there were moves to tackle hidden pay discrimination this is why we have to change the law to give women the right to know what a male colleague earns if they suspect they are being paid unequally for doing equal work verdict labours policies will speed up the pace of change but closing the gap completely by seems unlikely without some additional measures,2019-11,claim labour close gender pay gap background labour party pledging

the liberal democrats have pledged to expand measures to tackle the gender pay gap by obliging bigger companies to publish data on employment levels by gender as well as for bame and lgbt staff the party also promised to push for a law to end the socalled pink tax whereby companies charge higher prices for fundamentally identical products such as razors or deodorants simply because they are marketed at women the proposals come as labour pledged to eradicate the gender pay gap by through measures such as a new agency able to fine organisations that fail to report on the subject and by expanding the requirement from firms with or more employees to those with over the joint announcements were timed to coincide with equal pay day on thursday the symbolic day when taking into account a mean gender pay gap of the average woman stops earning relative to men the lib dem offer would extend the obligation of larger organisations to publish data on their gender pay gap in place since to become a more general report of information on employment levels across gender race and sexual orientation the measure on the pink tax would be based around a bill tabled earlier this year by christine jardine the partys equalities spokesperson jardine said equal pay day always leaves a bitter taste for women across the uk it is totally unacceptable that in the st century women are still hit with the double whammy of the price and pay gap the conservatives have failed to take necessary action to help ensure gender equality in a separate announcement the lib dems were to announce on thursday a broader plan for equality and human rights with proposals including better protection of schools places of worship or other centres vulnerable to hate attacks and making all hate crimes aggravated offences subject to tougher sentencing the labour announcement on the gender pay gap promises swifter action to redress an imbalance which at current rates of change would take an estimated more years to close plans would include a new workers protection agency which would work with hmrc to enforce gender pay reporting by the obligation to do this would be extended to smaller firms other genderequality policy ideas would include to extend statutory maternity pay from nine to months free childcare for two to fouryearolds and better employment protection for pregnant women laura pidcock the shadow employment secretary said for far too long the interests of working women have been at the bottom of the list of priorities for government labour in government will be uncompromising in

there are two stark facts about british politics the first is that it is controlled to a degree unparalleled in any other western european nation by a tiny unrepresentative elite like almost every aspect of public life here government is dominated by people educated first at private schools then at either oxford or cambridge the second is that many of these people possess a disastrous set of traits dishonesty class loyalty and an absence of principle so what of our current prime minister what drives him what enables such people to dominate us we urgently need to understand a system that has poisoned the life of this nation for more than a century i think i understand it better than most because there is a strong similarity between what might have been the defining event of boris johnsons childhood and mine both of us endured a peculiarly british form of abuse one intimately associated with the nature of power in this country we were sent to boarding school when we were very young he was slightly older than me rather than eight but was dispatched as so many boys were after a major family trauma i didnt think a school could be worse than my first boarding school elstree but the accounts that have emerged from his ashdown house during the current independent inquiry into child sexual abuse suggest that it achieved this improbable feat throughout the period when johnson was a pupil the inquiry heard paedophilia was normalised as the journalist alex renton another expupil records the headmaster was a vicious sadist who delighted in beating as many boys as possible and victimised those who sought to report sexual attacks and other forms of abuse johnson was at first extremely hostile to the inquiry describing it as money spaffed up a wall but he later apologised to other former pupils he has accepted that sexual assaults took place at the school though he says he did not witness them but a culture of abuse affects everybody one way or another in my s i met the man who had been the worst bully at my first boarding school he was candid and apologetic he explained that he had been sexually abused by teachers and senior boys acting in concert tormenting younger pupils was his way of reasserting power the psychotherapist joy schaverien lists a set of symptoms that she calls boarding school syndrome early boarding she finds has similar effects to being taken into care but with the added twist that your parents have demanded it premature separation from your family can cause profound developmental damage the justification for early boarding is based on a massive but common misconception because physical hardship in childhood makes you physically tough the founders of the system believed that emotional hardship must make you emotionally tough it does the opposite it causes psychological damage that only years of love and therapy can later repair but if there are two things that being sent to boarding school teach you they are that love cannot be trusted and that you should never admit to needing help on my first night at boarding school i felt entirely alone i was shocked frightened and intensely homesick but i soon discovered that expressing these emotions instead of bringing help and consolation attracted a gloating predatory fascination the older boys being vulnerable themselves knew exactly where to find your weaknesses there was one night of grace and thereafter the bullying was relentless by day and night it was devastating there was no pastoral care at all staff looked on with indifference as the lives of the small children entrusted to them fell apart they believed we should sink or swim the same philosophy applied to swimming by the way nonswimmers were thrown into the deep end of an unheated pool in march i was cut off from everything i knew and loved most importantly i cut myself off from my feelings when expressions of emotion are dangerous and when you are constantly told that this terrible thing is being done for your own good you quickly learn to hide your true feelings even from yourself in other words you learn the deepest form of dishonesty this duplicity becomes a habit of mind if every day you lie to yourself lying to other people becomes second nature you develop a shell a character whose purpose is to project an appearance of confidence and strength while inside all is fear and flight and anger the shell may take the form of steely reserve expansive charm bumbling eccentricity or a combination of all three but underneath it you are desperately seeking assurance the easiest means of achieving it is to imagine that you can dominate your feelings by dominating other people repressed people oppress people in adulthood you are faced with a stark choice to remain the person this system sought to create justifying and reproducing its cruelties or to spend much of your life painfully unlearning what it taught you and learning to be honest again to experience your own emotions without denial to rediscover love and trust in other words you must either question almost nothing or question almost everything though only small numbers of people went through this system it afflicts the entire nation many powerful politicians are drawn from this damaged caste david cameron for example was seven when he was sent to boarding school we will not build a kinder more

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday women are indisputably better than men according to renowned male feminist barack obama im absolutely confident that for two years if every nation on earth was run by women you would see a significant improvement across the board on just about everything the former president recently opined at a private leadership event in singapore thanks for the vote of confidence obama but thats complete nonsense if every nation on earth was run by a woman like jacinda ardern it might be true if the world were run by the likes of aung san suu kyi however it would be quite another story women youll be amazed to know are not a monolithic group obamas sweeping statements about women arent just facile theyre supremely unhelpful they reinforce the myth that women and men are innately different that women are biologically programmed to be more cooperative and compassionate than men were not were just socially conditioned to be peoplepleasers and from day one were held to higher standards than men boys will be boys but girls are expected to be angels having more female leaders is also completely meaningless if those women simply lean in to exploitative systems of power its not old white men that are the problem its patriarchal capitalism its an economic system in which power and resources are hoarded by the few its the conflation of leadership with stereotypically male traits like aggression and its the idea that one sex is indisputably better than another why were female candidates the only ones to apologize in the democratic debate thursdays democratic presidential debate finished with the sort of question you might find in cosmopolitan magazine candidates could choose to ask forgiveness from their party rivals or give them a gift the women on stage elizabeth warren and amy klobuchar both chose to apologize warren for getting really worked up klobuchar for being blunt the men on the other hand all said theyd give their books as gifts or that beating trump would be a gift to america its depressing that no matter how many achievements they rack up women still feel like they need to apologize for their passion and speaking their minds and its infuriating that so many men in power seem to think they never need to apologize would you lend us a hand toppling the

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday scoops for sex want to make a name for yourself in journalism its easy really just get your kit off and sleep with a source female reporters do it all the time in order to get exclusive stories according to the sentient jar of hair wax otherwise known as fox news host jesse watters watters made this disgusting and completely ludicrous claim on wednesday while discussing the backlash to clint eastwoods new movie richard jewell the film is based on the reallife story of an eponymous security guard wrongfully accused of planting a bomb at the olympic games and portrays a female journalist sleeping with an fbi agent in order to land an exclusive story heres the thing though there appears to be absolutely no evidence that the journalist in question atlanta journalconstitution ajc reporter kathy scruggs played by olivia wilde slept with her fbi source in order to break the story that jewell was a suspect in the incident lets just recap that shall we warner brothers made a movie about a man whose reputation was unfairly ruined by a careless fbi and a media ecosystem more interested in rushing out a good story than establishing the truth and in order to spice things up they casually besmirched the reputation of a female reporter because as we all know women arent threedimensional human beings in the same way men are their reputations dont matter their stories dont matter what makes all this even more infuriating is that scruggs isnt even around to stick up for herself she died in the ajc however has staunchly defended her and asked warner brothers to add a disclaimer to the film acknowledging the whole sexforinformation thing was a fictionalization warner brothers has refused to do this issuing a statement saying it was based on a wide range of highly credible source material im highly skeptical that there is any credible evidence that scruggs slept with her sources if there was then i reckon it would already be in the public domain after all theres nothing the world loves more than slutshaming women just look at katie hill just look at monica lewinsky just look at janet jackson whose career suffered for years after the world caught a glimpse of her nipple at the superbowl the conversation around richard jewell and watters sweepingly sexist comments serve as yet another reminder that women are damned if they do and theyre damned if they dont they dont get excused for their sexual transgressions in the same way men do they get branded for life whats more women dont even have to sleep with anyone to get labelled a slut or accused of using their sexuality to get ahead as the editor of the ajc has noted the idea that women sleep their way to the top is the worst kind of trope and not only is it sexist and insulting its nonsensical after all if women everywhere are cynically sleeping their way to the top wouldnt there be rather more women at the top megan rapinoe calls fucking bullshit on that the soccer star who was recently named sports illustrated sportsperson of the year is not impressed by a study that shows metoo has made men

bullshit on that harvey weinstein reaches m settlement with over women the new york times reports that the settlement which would bring multiple civil lawsuits to an end would be paid by insurance

the photograph of a fouryearold boy asleep on the floor of leeds general infirmary because of a lack of beds has become a fixture of this final week of the general election not just as an illustration of the damage almost years of tory rule have done to the nhs but because of the prime ministers cartoonishly callous reaction to it the photo is horribly brutally real dr yvette oade the chief medical officer at leeds teaching hospitals nhs trust personally apologised for how the boy and his family were treated but this did not prevent a conspiracy theory from emerging across social media a paragraph of identical text was shared by multiple users often purporting to be the original suggesting that the boy in the picture was planted there by his labour activist mother precisely to discredit the tories on the nhs the text was originally shared on the facebook page of a woman who works as a medical secretary who claimed afterwards that her account had been hacked the post was given considerable amplification by conservative candidates former mps a former england cricket captain kevin pietersen as well as the telegraph columnist allison pearson who quoted the text almost as if it had been sent to her by a source this kind of conspiratorial thinking has become all too familiar in recent years the leeds case almost directly parallels what happened when boris johnson visited whipps cross hospital in london earlier this year and was berated by the father of a sick newborn who was later accused of being a plant but there is a tendency to discuss this sort of conspiratorialism note this very useful twitter thread on photogate primarily in terms of disinformation or fake news as if what matters most about it is that people are being factually misinformed facts and truth are being insufficiently defended bad information is being allowed to push out good but theres a deeper and more troubling question that doesnt get asked as often why do people find misinformation like this convincing and feel driven to share it or comment approvingly in reply to it our receptivity to information is shaped in part by the sort of evidence or testimony we have found to be reliable in the past but it is also shaped by our desires how we want the world to be to cite a nonpolitical example if a random child produced some scribbles that resembled a brilliant work of abstract art i would probably think this was more likely to be a coincidence than evidence of a prodigious gift but if my own son did it i might find myself headed to sothebys and expecting it to sell for millions when i see people sharing something like the leeds hospital photo conspiracy people saying that this is all a mendacious labour plot to make the nhs seem like its in crisis i feel their raging obvious desire to believe that it is true there is something epistemically basic about suffering at one point in his philosophical investigations the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein asks us to just try in a real case to doubt someone elses fear or pain his point being its impossible to do honestly if you saw someone screaming in anguish you wouldnt stop to ask if they were really in pain before trying to help over the past nine years the tories have helped create a world where the relevant ethical considerations are just that basic nhs cuts are forcing sick young children to sleep in hospital corridors on piles of coats austerity has been linked to more than preventable deaths the governing party has simply introduced more suffering into the world than was in it before the visible presence of suffering helps indicate that things ought to be different if you are an in any way decent person you cannot justify taking any sort of action that you know might help the tories remain in government but this is a troubling thought for all sorts of reasons some people want to vote for the tories anyway for instance because they think it will help deliver brexit although i mean come on even if you support brexit the tories have had three years to deliver it theyre playing you some people feel like theyre doing all right as things stand and dont want to have to pay a few more pounds a month in tax some people i guess just cant be bothered they do not want to be saddled with the burden of caring for others hence the conspiracy conspiratorial thinking helps people blind themselves to any and all evidence it can be used to explain away suffering so that people can feel like they dont bear any responsibility to help deal with it it deploys a seductive scepticism what if all the evidence of our senses is wrong what if all the poverty and strangling disinvestment anyone in the country must see signs of every day is a hoax invented by the labour party to help it turn the uk into a colder version of venezuela what if the effects of climate change are being exaggerated and really its just been a randomly hot and wildfirey past few summers what if every homeless person you see begging desperate and cold on the street is just tricking you what if they take all the pennies that saps like you give them and spend them on champagne and caviar in the little waitrose under their newbuild flat why then you might not need to care about anything beyond your own nose at all the people spreading the leeds hospital photo conspiracy dont just need to face facts

when the conservative mp mark field leapt from his chair pushed a female greenpeace protester against a pillar gripped the back of her neck and then manhandled her out of a mansion house banquet in june he probably did not anticipate the headlines janet barker the climate emergency activist was not alone in being stunned at his hotheaded actions when tv footage emerged capturing fields ferocious look as he propelled barker roughly towards the exit it unleashed a formidable backlash the image of male physical dominance over a slightly built female attired in an elegant red evening gown and wearing a climate emergency sash triggered anger disbelief and the immediate suspension of field as a foreign office minister in theresa mays government fields reputation was certainly not enhanced when barker with red marks still visible on her upper arm told the guardian the following day that the parliamentarian had shoved her into the street with the words this is what happens when people like you disturb our dinner six months on barker says that although she was surprised and shocked by the incident at the time it really hit her afterwards when she saw the footage its strange when you are in that position you dont really realise what is happening when i watched it afterwards i was shocked more shocked in a sense than when it happened you see it from a different perspective the perspective everyone else viewed it from so i was quite taken aback afterwards when i viewed it and i could then kind of understand why it got so much attention barkers action at the banquet was designed to draw attention to the climate emergency what it led to was a debate on male aggression entitlement and privilege as a longstanding activist barker had been one of a group of to greenpeace members carrying out peaceful protest at the blacktie city event their aim was to deliver a copy of a speech in a sealed letter to the then chancellor philip hammond who was sitting at the top table about government investment in fossil fuels field later apologised for grabbing her claiming he had reacted instinctively fearing she might be armed he referred himself to the cabinet office for investigation the only thing i was armed with was peerreviewed science barker who was carrying a phone a small handbag and some leaflets said later she suggested field might like to avail himself of some help for anger management declining to make an official police complaint she thought it something best dealt with in the court of public opinion and a cabinet office investigation was enough for her except that there has been no official investigation into fields actions nor will there be when boris johnson became prime minister one of his first actions was to drop field from his ministerial role as part of a reshuffle and drop any cabinet office investigation into the behaviour of the then mp for cities of london and westminster it was said johnson a matter for the previous prime minister barker who is from a village in midwales where she works in environmental education and homelessness prevention says it was a bit of an eyerolling moment for me i just thought oh god i wasnt surprised lets leave it at that field is not contesting his seat in this election city of london police received a number of thirdparty reports that an offence of assault had occurred that night after careful assessment it later announced no further action would be taken against field when the cabinet office inquiry was dropped field said he was hugely relieved that the matter was now considered closed and pointed to the police exonerating his actions as proportionate and lawful in the circumstances of the serious breach in security barker still stands by her decision not to make a formal police complaint fearing the climate crisis argument would be lost in any subsequent legal fray he has now resigned he was an mp a representative in a position of power of setting good standards of responsibility unfortunately that didnt happen so i think that the right thing has come out of it she says suddenly finding herself at the centre of media attention was overwhelming she says i just went in for a climate protest and then found myself in the midst of many other ongoing social issues almost part of the whole metoo movement i mean i am privileged in that i hadnt come across that kind of behaviour from men in my past and i did find it upsetting at the time but i didnt find it traumatic probably because i havent had that experience but i understand that for other women it probably triggered some deep feelings quite rightly in the circumstances she had social media messages from people urging her to take the matter further i did sympathise with that and i did feel perhaps i was letting people down in that sense but i also felt that the message we wanted the treasury to start thinking about about where money is invested would perhaps have been lost a little bit media attention was a sharp and sudden bombardment she says then it seemed to stop one or two days then after that normal life completely resumed in our little village a few people said well done the rest just seemed to ignore it or maybe they didnt see it barker has carried on with her activism as before i am continuing with pushing forward the issue that we have a climate emergency she says she joined an extinction rebellion peaceful protest in london and is still active in her local greenpeace group she is campaigning on the link between some fast food chains and amazon rainforest destruction i will always have fire in my belly i just appreciate our natural world i love going out walking id be doing much more walking if it wasnt for all this protesting she says as for her feelings on field he can get on with his life and hopefully his behaviour will change in a positive way and he might learn from it and become a better person,2019-12,conservative mp mark field leapt

sign up for the week in patriarchy a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every saturday peloton husband finally shares his terrible ordeal sean hunter a canadian actor and school teacher was thrilled when he booked a role in a peloton ad he had a blast filming the commercial and when the ad came out in november his friends kindly told him it was great but this week the ad went viral and poor hunters world started to fall apart twitter declared the ad very bad indeed people were mean about him on the internet and suggested the fictional husband he played was abusive one of his own pals joked that hunter had become a symbol of the patriarchy recounting his ordeal to psychology today hunter lamented that his five seconds of air time created an array of malicious feedback that is all associated with my face in order to distance himself from the commercial hunter changed his instagram handle to pelotonhusband for those of you havent seen the ad yet a woman gets pelotons wifienabled exercise bike from her husband hunter for christmas she starts a video diary of her sessions and manages to give the unnerving impression that her husband will beat her or leave her if she doesnt wake up early every morning to exercise on her fancy bike thats the precis but i suggest you watch the ad for yourself because words cant do justice to how cringeworthy it is indeed when i first saw it trending i assumed peloton had made the ad awful on purpose so that it would go viral the company is valued at several billion dollars after all surely it knows what its doing and then i watched the sexist and dystopian ad it wasnt tongueincheek terrible it was terribleterrible its attempts to portray getting on an exercise bike as some sort of lifechanging spiritual journey inadvertently lifted a lid on the wellness industry revealing it as an expensive scam i started to understand why the companys stock had plunged and it had lost bn in value amid the twitter backlash i have some sympathy for the fact that hunters face is now associated with a viral ad the entire internet is dunking on but its also somewhat ironic that a man with five seconds of air time has set out to prove he isnt a symbol of the patriarchy by making the peloton advert controversy entirely about him and bizarrely casting himself as a victim hunter could have spent five minutes thinking critically about why the ad was being called sexist instead he whined that viewers can mistake an actor as that person after theyve seen them on television instead of a person given a script with no opinion on what they are being told to portray dude i think people realize you were playing a fictional character and that you didnt write the script he also sadly asked if recognized on the street what will peoples first opinions be of me hunter mate let me reassure you that by next week this ad and your face will be very old news montreal massacre finally acknowledged as a misogynistic attack thirty years ago a gunman killed young women in montreals cole polytechnique it was the deadliest mass shooting in canadas history and was very clearly an act of gender terrorism the shooter told his victims he was fighting feminism and in a suicide letter blamed feminists for ruining his life despite his explicit misogyny however it wasnt until thursday that the tragedy was officially described as an antifeminist attack on the eve of the th anniversary of the massacre a new memorial plaque was unveiled condemning the antifeminist attack and all forms of violence against women mike pences
