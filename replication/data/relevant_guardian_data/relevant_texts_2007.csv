the government was warned today against taking a big stick to lone parents as new proposals were outlined to boost the numbers of single parents in work the work and pensions secretary john hutton signalled his willingness to consider more stringent requirements for lone parents to look for work as part of a package of measures to encourage them back into employment and alleviate child poverty very little is currently asked of lone parents on benefit with a requirement to look for work that begins only when the youngest child reaches the age of mr hutton said in a speech in central london today mr hutton cited evidence which showed that when the youngest child reached as many as a third of lone parents moved almost seamlessly on to incapacity benefit or made a further claim for income support within the following months he said the uk was at the bottom of the league of major european countries for lone parent employment rates he said countries such as sweden and denmark make little distinction between lone parents and other benefit recipients in terms of their obligation to look for work but mr hutton insisted that the country should never go back to the time when lone parents were routinely blamed for being poor but should raise the aspirations of every family in britain neither should lone parents be at the receiving end of the noisy moralising of rightwing politicians he added lone parenthood is rarely a lifestyle choice we should never forget this he said yet politicians and campaigners on the progressive left risk failing future generations of children if we are not prepared to learn from other progressive countries and assume that a childhood spent on benefits is good for children and their parents it isnt we know that children of lone parents not in work are over five times more likely to be in poverty than children of lone parents in fulltime employment he added and around of poor children live in lone parent households the majority of which are nonworking yet we also know the difference that helping lone parents into work can make a significant proportion of our progress so far in tackling child poverty is due to helping lone parents move into work but jane ahrends spokeswoman for the group one parent families saidthat twothirds of single parents who had children aged between and yearsold were already working the majority usually amongst those who are not working have very good reasons for not doing so a third of divorces happen when children are in that age category so it may well be that single parents decide that their priority must be to stabilise family life and to be at home with their children while most single parents want to work when the time is right for them and their children there are very high barriers for them particularly in the absence of affordable local childcare a big stick approach could deter thousands of single parents coming forward and using the excellent voluntary new deal for lone parents scheme in his speech mr hutton outlined advances in childcare provision saying that by there would be a childcare place for all children aged between three and from am to pm each weekday

week and some parents are paying as much as a week the lowest nursery costs are in the midlands and the lowest childminder costs in the northwest government financial help with childcare costs is available through the tax credit system and many parents can now also get tax relief through their employer via childcare vouchers three and fouryearolds are entitled to hours of free nursery

balancing family and career doesnt allow much time for pondering the gender pay gap just as well too long spent considering the implications of the figures a fulltime womans hourly rate of pay is less than that of a fulltime male worker while the chasm between fulltime men and parttime women is a staggering and a working mother would wonder whether it was worth bothering to get a job at all following recommendations from the women and work commission the government will next week launch a scheme to improve the quality of parttime jobs a fund of will be available for employers to get advice on how to best open up opportunities at a higher level in addition exemplar employers have been rounded up companies with a commitment to reducing the gender pay gap to encourage others to follow suit is it enough not according to many of the women ive spoken to women with small kids and jobs mothers just returning to work others still at home looking after their children ive also consulted childfree women pregnant women and those considering whether to have a child then this week i went to consult another woman minister for women ruth kelly who will be launching the latest initiatives on tuesday some of my questions get pushed to one side albeit with a grin what is your experience as a working mum all working mums have challenges and i have challenges just like any other she says some get flannelled while others get answers that are reassuring childcare has been such a priority for this government it is a huge priority even if they dont come with promises attached the government has made flexible working a priority too but while you might have the right to ask your employer for flexible working finding flexible work at an equivalent level to what you were doing prepregnancy is still tough to find work that is or is perceived to be flexible enough to fit around childcare arrangements many women end up taking jobs for which they are overqualified sacrificing both salary and status why asks katherine rake director of the fawcett society cant the government compel employers to offer all jobs on a flexible basis the reality is there are very few parttime jobs available all jobs should be offered on a flexible basis rake insists but kelly says current measures are working before when the right to request flexible working was introduced nearly half of all women swapped employers when they came back from maternity leave the most recent figures i have is that this has dropped by half thats a reallife impact of the right to request flexible working yes but what about showing employers some muscle its almost impossible for someone sitting in whitehall to know what would really make a difference within an individual company replies kelly one employer might need to offer jobshares while another might need to think about whether they have segregated jobs where women have lower status lower paid roles it could be a completely different response that is appropriate for women to fully benefit from flexible working it has to become commonplace for fathers too while twoweeks paternity leave has been a start and the intention is to extend this to weeks in october flexible working is still largely seen as a female issue for as long as this is the case it will carry less weight with employers it should be about real choices that families make if fathers want to work shorter hours and try and stay at home we should try to make that happen if women want to stay at home when their children are young then we should try and facilitate that too kelly says its about opening up choices for men women and families britains longhours working culture doesnt help when it comes to encouraging men to ask for flexible arrangements if you routinely work hours a week what is parttime parttime jobs are seen as work for people who dont need to be taken seriously women complain of being sidelined interesting work being taken elsewhere of promotion going to fulltimers if you subtract from the salary of an underpaid parttime job the cost of two or more small children needing nursery care the economics dont stack up women find themselves working for effectively nothing just so they can stay in the labour market some would be better off not working whether or not they wanted to return to the office kelly points to working families tax credit and childcare voucher schemes where you sacrifice part of your salary in return for vouchers taken from your pay before tax as evidence of efforts to address this problem but the schemes are organised in perhaps the most confusing way possible the working family tax credit has changed peoples lives she says it may be confusing but i bet people arent saying that their financial position hasnt improved significantly as a result they might not be saying theyre worse off but the women i spoke to do want to know why a it has to be so complicated and b childcare vouchers are capped at a parent and dont rise if you have more children why as one mum asked cant you pay for the whole of your childcare pretax kelly isnt keen taking people out of tax is a potential way forward but the fact is that if you do that you benefit predominantly those who are on the higher income tax levels and were trying to think of ways of using the resources we have most effectively to open up opportunities for everyone as part of this pledge to open up opportunities kelly hopes to tackle the problem of workplace segregation whereby women take lowerstatus and often lowerpaid jobs than men through careers advice for secondary school pupils that avoids stereotypes and encourages girls to consider occupations traditionally seen as male combined with better childcare facilities such as new childrens centres and a different approach to the quality of parttime work the stubborn gender pay gap may finally begin to close what can i report back to the women i consulted dont expect change any time soon but maybe the daughter youre bundling off to nursery or school will one day be paid her real worth,2007-01,balancing family career doesnt allow much time pondering gender

at my first meeting of the excellent group women against fundamentalism which is now reforming last weekend i was challenged about what feminist blogging can actually achieve sure it gets words out there my questioner said but does it actually create networks and achieve things one answer to her challenge came this week on monday which if you read feminist blogs youll know was blog for choice day americanfocused of course you can tell from the wording but prochoice women from around the world joined in looking down the alphabetical listing contributors run from st century mom who has just crossed out her age from to to you see me you hear me who doesnt give her age but given that she writes in txt in a livejournal format is probably young they range around the world from the dead roo whose location youve probably guessed to lacanistas lowdown in paris to we move to canada plus of course a huge collection from the united states such a day might not put boots on the ground in a protest march or produce a formal petition but it does get the message of a womens right to choose out there bringing it to the attention of women young and old across the globe it reminds them all that there is almost nowhere on the globe that a woman can be certain of maintaining the right to control over her own body the most basic human right that there is it also collects together collective knowledge of ideas and tactics to continue the fight my post was about a bbc investigation that found some women were having to wait up to seven weeks for an abortion through nhs services and it was while i was investigating the story that i was reminded anew as to why such campaigns are important first up on my google news search came an anonymoussounding name of a news organisation of which i had not heard so i clicked and found it was an antiabortion group trying to pretend to be a news organisation twisting and slanting that report suggesting that the abortion waiting list should be just as long as that as a hip replacement to be fair no im not going to point you to it for obvious reasons but thats the sort of poisonous muck that is out there always it seems wellfunded and wellresourced then it repeated all the usual scientifically bogus claims about the damage abortion is supposed to do to women since it is these men of course who just want to control womens bodies for their own good women in their world view not being up to the task themselves the prochoice campaign is often less well resourced often less technologically flashy but the sheer passionate honesty of all of those posts of blogging for choice should go some way towards balancing such antiabortion propaganda this is women talking by and large to other women about the realities of their lives and

it is very easy to persuade people that slag is not an acceptable insult to level at a woman you wouldnt say that to a man you could point out even though it is pretty much a crossgender term these days and one might often hear a man described as a right slapper that still seems to hold there ought to be a flipside to this we ought in the year to have stopped talking about chastity as a feminine virtue we ought to have stopped holding women up as the gatekeepers to sex who get to be in charge because they dont enjoy it we ought to have stopped perseverating on how men want it with anyone any which way where women only want it with kind funny generous men yet the curve is going in the opposite direction in america commentators i suppose theyre called have long been haranguing adult and teenage females about the boon of chastity we are not without our own fuglewomen kate taylor has just published not tonight mr right a book instructing adult women how to conduct themselves in the world of sex taylor follows writers from sylvia ann hewlett academic and fervid campaigner against female emancipation to dawn eden onetime groupie bornagain virgin they all used to buy the feminist line they used to believe that women could be free and now theyve realised that true freedom is in keeping an aspirin between the knees ah the wisdom of grandmas the tips are all the same here is one of taylors believing women can have sex as light and breezily as men is rubbish too for one thing men like to have more sexual partners than women and here in the same vein is one of edens whatever germaine greer and her ilk may say ive tried their philosophy that a woman can shag like a man and it doesnt work were not built like that women are built for bonding we are vessels and we seek to be filled they always drag greer into it as though she offered up a shoddy philosophy that didnt hold water and these make him beg philosophers are actually offering something more solid it just needs to be dispatched really fast there is no physiological evidence for women and men having different needs from congress our kind not the american kind only circumstantial evidence which is indivisible from the social conditioning that creates it there is no evidence that women are more picky there is only evidence that in some countries they dont drink as much booze there is no evidence that women are left more vulnerable when sex doesnt lead to a relationship there is possibly evidence that they complain more about it but no gender is immune from rejection who knows there might well be evidence that men are more likely to propose to women who withhold sex but greers original philosophy was never i dont think do it like i do and men will like you more the insult here is not against greer herself who can still being alive look after herself it is in the fact that when you take a crudely analysed life lesson and you try and fit it to all womanhood it is not just neutral chatter it actively undermines one of the greatest fundamentals of feminism that sex can be an act of equality entered into with equal enthusiasm by people who enjoy it equally without that we would still be mired in the grim swamp where men are out to trick women into oops accidentally giving them sex or failing that bullying or bribing or blackmailing them into it until finally they are not worth the effort and can be swapped for body parts just the same only younger and better that was culture for prefeminist women that is the effectual enslavement that these mindless just show him an ankle until

thanks ruth kelly youve done something that labour hasnt managed to do in all its years of banging on about education education education highlighted the plight of parents with special needs children i feel some sympathy for kelly like her i believe in state education and both my children are at state schools similarly one of them has a learning difficulty and there is no question that if i had the money i would send him to a private school for special needs children why because it could provide the specialist teaching that is not available at his local primary kellys local education authority tower hamlets claims it has the facilities to educate her child and this may be true but it is not true of all leas despite the fact that they have a legal duty to ensure that children with special needs receive the help they require it simply does not happen in many cases if the school does not have the resources to help the child the school or the parents can apply for a statement of educational needs but the lea has a conflict of interest if it decides your child needs a statement it will have to pay for the resources to meet it whats more the lea has six months from the time it receives the request before making a final statement six months in which your child can fall further and further behind it took me four years to get a statement for my child my first hurdle was to convince the school that my child had learning difficulties despite widespread publicity about dyslexia and dyspraxia for example many teachers do not pick it up from the time my son started school it was clear that he was not keeping up with the rest of his class where my daughters reports said things such as she is keen to learn his said he has developed various tactics to avoid starting his work while the other children rapidly learned to read at seven he still struggled to read the simplest words i went back and forth to the school voicing my concern that there was a specific problem initially i was told he was just a late starter then that he wasnt motivated i asked about applying for a statement but was told there was no hope of getting one until he was at least three years behind his peers the lea confirmed this the school did eventually acknowledge there was a problem and did all it could my son had masses of extra help and was taught in a small group separate from the main class where possible what the school couldnt do was provide the specialist teaching he needed finally the school asked the lea to make an assessment with a view to a statement in that time we had seen our own gp the school doctor the leas educational psychologist and an occupational therapist all agreed that my son needed specialist help the lea concurred and gave him a statement i was overjoyed it should have been a happy ending but it wasnt the statement provided for almost fulltime help for my son on a onetoone basis however there is no requirement for that helper to have any special needs qualifications or experience and ours didnt the statement also said my son would get speech therapy and occupational therapy provided by the local health authority now the health authority has written to say that because of health cuts no children in the borough at key stage two will receive speech therapy at the moment he was supposed to get occupational therapy but after just four sessions we were told he did not need any more help despite the fact that he clearly does for me as for so many other parents of children with special needs the battle goes on so yes i do feel some sympathy for ruth kelly but what a shame she couldnt have used her position to change the state system rather than opting out particularly since she was so vociferous in her support of inclusive education when she was education minister,2007-01,thanks ruth kelly youve done something labour hasnt managed year banging education education education highlighted plight parent special

the glass ceiling is still holding back women from the top jobs in britain according to new research from the equal opportunities commission thirty years after the introduction of the sex discrimination act women are woefully underrepresented in the countrys boardrooms politics and courts it says help from nannies has not enabled successful women to maintain their careers after having children the research suggests the eoc blames a maledominated culture in the professions for resistance to flexible working the upward trend in the proportion of women in top jobs is painfully slow the report says and in some sectors there is even a decline the proportion of women in parliament has slipped in the months since the eocs last sex and power survey and is now at lower than in iraq afghanistan and rwanda despite the successes of women such as clara furse chief executive of the london stock exchange and lady clark of calton who is only one of four female senior judges currently serving the proportion of women directors of top ftse companies has dipped to and of female judges to jenny watson chair of the eoc said todays troubling findings show just how slow the pace of change has been in powerful british institutions they suggest its time not just to send out the headhunters to find some of those missing women but to address the barriers that stand in their way thirty years on from the sex discrimination act women rightly expect to share power but as our survey shows thats not the reality we all pay the price when britains boardrooms and elected chambers are unrepresentative our democracy and local communities will be stronger if women from different backgrounds are able to enjoy an equal voice in business no one can afford to fish in half the talent pool in todays intensely competitive world in total the commission identified of the countrys most influential jobs in the private sector politics the legal system and the public sector to achieve a representative proportion more of those jobs would have to be filled by women it said at the current rate of improvement it would take years to achieve equality in the civil service years in the judiciary and years among ftse companies but it would take years at least another elections to achieve an equal number of mps in parliament the proportion in the scottish assembly is nearly and in wales the figure is the eoc said it was an argument for parties to use allwomen shortlists as in wales but figures for women from ethnic minorities are worse there are only two black women mps four nonwhite top ftse directors and nine top civil servants from ethnic minority backgrounds ethnic minority women are still largely invisible in public life and this has to change if we want our communities to thrive the report says the research suggests that women are experiencing the same barriers to getting the jobs they want as women in lower paid jobs the pay gap between men and women is in their s rising to for thirtysomethings a change which is largely attributed to the impact of childbirth on womens earnings the same is not true for men who become fathers female workers in the uk suffer one of the biggest pay gaps in europe for fulltime staff and for parttime because they are more likely to be in lowpaid jobs and then slip further down the career ladder after having children the women and work commission found last year ms watson said that women were getting higher up the career ladder but having children still prevented them from getting the top jobs asking for flexible working still spells career death for too many women in todays workplace and as a consequence women with caring responsibilities all too often have to trade down to keep working extending the right to ask for flexible working to everyone in the workplace would change that culture and enable more women to reach the top she said katherine rake director of the fawcett society which campaigns for equal rights said this demonstrates how much of a male preserve power remains in the uk if decisions are only being taken by one group of the population they will not reflect the lives of ordinary people it proves beyond a doubt that life at the top is white and male the annual report is the last from the eoc which is due to be amalgamated with the commission for racial equality and the disability rights commission from next year into a new body called the commission for equality and human rights there have been concerns that the womens rights agenda could be sidelined in the new body which will be headed by trevor phillips current chair of the cre there is so much more to be done this demonstrates that we havent solved the problem of sex discrimination said ms watson,2007-01,glass ceiling still

for working or wouldbe working mothers it seems the personal has at last become political if only because a mediasavvy highprofile man has chosen to speak up on their behalf the struggles faced daily and the pay and status forfeit experienced by women attempting to balance a decent job and family responsibilities are familiar to any mother hurtling around the supermarket between leaving the office and dashing home or attempting to make a crucial work phone call in the brief window when her child is asleep for those who cared to look indeed the price paid by women who take time out from a career to have children has also been on the public policy agenda for some years now the governments own womens unit highlighted the female forfeit affecting womens pay some eight years ago while the equal opportunities commission has been relentless in its exposure of the discrimination faced by mothers and particularly pregnant women in the workplace the government indeed has been attempting albeit slowly and with less conviction than some would wish to address some of these problems maternity rights have improved from insultingly meagre to relatively generous and the right to ask to work flexibly has made a difference for tens of thousands of women and only last year its own women and work commission reiterated the many barriers that remain but still the widespread surprise at the evidence that mothers face the greatest discrimination in the labour market highlighted today in the final report of the equalities review pdf reveals that these realities have not truly made the waves they deserved mens employment rates after all are not affected by fatherhood and women without children experience only a small employment penalty the economy can trundle on with little concern for the opportunities and incomes lost by mothers what is vital now is that the reaction to todays news is not merely that we all throw up our hands and return to the hunt for new ways for women to work flexibly while that process is still unfinished it too is a debate that has already moved on yes we must ensure mothers can combine work and family responsibilities but no amount of flexibility for one partner can be the answer only by ensuring that fathers also have real access to flexible working can they spend the time with their children eoc research has shown that three out of four people say it should be as easy for men as for women to take time off for caring responsibilities and over twothirds of us now believe that the traditional model of male breadwinner and female homemaker is a thing of the past so after catching up with the realities faced by mothers at work the equalities commission now needs to catch up with the solution adapting womens work can only ever be part of the story if womens work options are truly to change and fathers are to see more of their children as they say they want and as the government believes they should then work should adapt to the needs of families and not just mothers,2007-02,working wouldbe working mother seems personal ha last become political mediasavvy highprofile man ha chosen speak behalf struggle faced daily pay

your leader highlighted the shocking rates of poverty faced by lone parents and their children signals for the singles february it is true that helping more lone parents into work is necessary to remove many children from poverty but the conclusion that to tackle this ministers are fully entitled to now begin examining ways of increasing the pressure on lone parents to rejoin the workforce doesnt follow while nine out of lone parents say they want to work and are already doing so many face considerable barriers to finding and keeping a job huge progress has been made in increasing the employment rate of lone parents in recent years by offering support through voluntary programmes such as the new deal tighter conditions on benefit receipt with punitive sanctions for those who fail to meet them are not the way to meet the aspirations of ministers and lone parents themselves for increased employment one parent families helpline has been inundated with anxious callers in recent days some said they could not find specialist care for their disabled child a quarter of lone parents have a child with a disability others were worried that if they were forced to work they would be unable to make ends meet because they would lose housing benefit several had just been through family breakup and wanted to settle things at home some were desperate for a job but couldnt find childcare they could afford and trust improvements in childcare have as your leader suggests been an unsung achievement of this government but the daycare trust recently reported that a fulltime childcare place can cost more than sending a child to eton the high swedish loneparent employment rate that your leader referred to is bolstered by a state that meets around of the costs of childcare compared with around in britain swedish lone parents also enjoy the benefits of an investment in training and employment programmes that is four times the level of that in the uk an entitlement to reduce their hours by until their children are eight paid emergency leave and better incentives to work just of lone parents in work in sweden are poor compared with of those who work parttime in britain wednesdays depressing unicef report reinforced the need for urgency in tackling poverty in all families helping more lone parents into work must play a part in that effort but when our labour market and welfare state still fail to allow parents to adequately combine working and caring sanctions are not the answer evidence from the us suggests that faced with the choice of unsustainable lowpaid work or a punitive workfare regime many parents fall out of the system altogether around million american children now live with mothers who are neither in work nor claiming welfare lone

while we welcome the governments stated commitment to tackling child poverty we question the idea that forcing single parents back to work is the way to do this report february nine out of lone

working cited a lack of childcare and of work at schoolfriendly hours as barriers to getting a job forty per cent also lack qualifications and as the institute for fiscal studies points out lone parents face some of the worst work incentives of any group measures to make work pay to improve skills and job sustainability and to expand the provision of childcare and flexible working would all

zoe parker is learning to put her foot down with her sevenyearold son keiron their new routine at home and his improved school attendance indicate parkers increasing selfconfidence and assertiveness she admits though i have help i know i must do things for myself but i need a jolt to get started i was nervous at first but now im glad for my support worker rebecca smiths weekly visits and her phone calls and texts the government endorses the right of people with learning difficulties such as parker to have children and advocates relevant support be provided however the likelihood of these children being taken into care is still to times higher than that of other youngsters the family welfare association fwa three years ago launched valuing families funded by leicestershire childrens fund to help local people with learning difficulties improve their parenting skills according to richard desjardins valuing families former project manager of children whose parents have learning difficulties are removed from their homes in of cases both parents have learning difficulties though their youngsters may not support when provided is not always flexible enough to meet individual needs and sometimes parents are less informed than they could be desjardins says to help these parents accept it our support must reflect our belief in their potential to learn clients regularly complain that they feel theyre expected to fail saying were told what we should to do but never how to do it so we identify their learning styles and shape our interventions accordingly for changes to be made in homes where parentchild roles may be reversed where personal boundaries are blurred and outsiders directives are often taken too literally all input must be clear and relevant desjardins stresses concepts of hygiene the organisation of household duties discipline and ruses for sidestepping literacy problems are best broached practically by straightforward demonstration by running through new procedures alongside clients or by simple instruction project workers may find themselves cleaning up or form filling helping with finances or initiating planned family time introducing toys to understimulated children or accompanying their diffident parents on daunting appointments with professionals tasks may be basic but ultimately helpful smith is one of the schemes two parttime support workers helping families across the county with the realities of childrearing for up to months parents with learning difficulties and under children are being encouraged to adopt new strategies for coping with each other and for examining themselves outofhours home visits enable staff to befriend entire family groups and lend a sense of informality to the service though families refer and even rerefer themselves for support most are recommended to valuing families by statutory and voluntary agencies smith says people tend to be wary and often confuse us with social workers who they fear will take away their youngsters i tread carefully to engage with my families and think that being a single parent helps me empathise each case and relationship is unique only after it is secure dare you for example discourage a mum from discussing her child in his or her presence after all youre on her territory and no one welcomes any strangers hints on bringing up their kids but it is vital to invite children into the mutual learning process at the crux of the projects success is the sensitive and mild pace at which communication is built up before the tailormade smallscale life changes are compiled helen dent fwas chief executive concludes valuing families proves that people with learning difficulties can and will be responsible parents as long as they receive the right amount of help providing our present level of homebased care is infinitely cheaper in every way than splitting up families and placing children into foster and residential care with small steps and

the government is once again signalling its return to welfare reform the objective in was to cut waste and move savings on welfare bills to support education and training since then the government has spent an additional bn in making work pay and in covering the cost of its various welfare to work schemes the results have been modest to put it mildly beveridge never meant welfare to be free of conditions nor did he think it important to give incentives to claimants to leave welfare he assumed people would do that automatically as jobs became available in the us president clinton combined a policy of carrots and sticks welfare was limited to a fiveyear duration the earned income tax credit was substantially increased and some funds went towards day care welfare rolls fell by and even after the economy started to stall the welfare rolls remained substantially reduced in the past the governments position has reflected the worst of both worlds it has talked tough but acted feebly it is once again talking tough but what will this mean most people accept that all of us should work when we can and only rely on benefits when work is not available in each of the main categories incapacity benefit and single parents the massive increase in the number of jobs has resulted in those who have been drawing benefit for the shortest period of time moving to employment the proportion of longterm claimants is on the rise both the increase in jobs and an array of special measures is not moving the longer term claimants off benefit in anything like the numbers which were held out for these programmes from now on the government must build on its childcare strategy and for these placements to dovetail into afterschool care it should then debate seriously whether lone parents have a right to draw benefit almost without condition until their youngest child is that is not how the real world works single mothers with young children should be discussing with jobcentre plus what training they wish to undertake to increase their employment opportunities parttime work should be required once children are in school fulltime and is it unreasonable to require single parents with children over to work fulltime we should also consider timelimiting benefits in the first instance for new claimants including incapacity benefit claimants but as the numbers of incapacity claimants are so great and as the government has no serious plans to help the longterm incapacity claimants back into work it should allow such claimants to continue to draw benefit for a year while they attempt to find work parttime work might then be built up into fulltime jobs and while this was happening claimants would know that if the exercise went pearshaped they would still be on benefit and particularly housing benefit a loss of job would not therefore be accompanied by threats of eviction if the government seriously does want to consider welfare reform it will need not only to talk tough but to act as though it means business,2007-02,government signalling return welfare reform objective wa cut waste move saving welfare bill support education training since government ha spent

some of the poorest children in britain live in loneparent households and most of the parents of these worstoff children are not in fulltime work that situation needs to change for three main reasons first and foremost this is because the children of lone parents in work are far less likely to be stuck in poverty than those whose parent is not in work second because getting lone parents into the workforce can help to reduce the longterm benefitdependency cycle in a substantial number of cases and third not to be dismissed because the governments budget is going to get tighter after the next public expenditure review anyway so cost pressures are likely to grow the case in principle for finding ways of getting more lone parents into work ought therefore to be beyond argument but what should the goals be the governments current target of a employment rate is necessarily somewhat arbitrary but it is broadly realistic the figure compares well with what other developed nations including sweden france and germany have actually achieved britains current rate among lone parents lags too far behind theirs and should be improved supporting parents is a far more effective and more humane way of reaching that goal than berating them into changing their ways so improved childcare both in the preschool years and beyond must clearly be fundamental to the effort yet such improvements are already increasingly in place in some eyes they add up to one of this governments quieter but most effective revolutions that means ministers are fully entitled to now begin examining ways of increasing the pressure on lone parents to rejoin the workforce the work and pensions secretary john hutton has spoken about giving parents a duty to attend job interviews when their children are rather than as at present but as our political editor reported yesterday some in downing street think that the age threshold could be more drastically reduced perhaps to as low as three as the provision of childcare is improved that is very radical and it will not be in the best interests of every child so such a system would require considerable discretion if it is to be implemented humanely mr hutton is now in australia looking at ways in which their church groups and other parts of the voluntary and private sectors have contributed to an apparent success story there some will bridle at the governments interest in such options but if they prove to have been a better way of helping some longterm unemployed lone parents back into work then it is hard to see what the argument

ask any school head and theyll tell you that the task of managing cajoling and motivating teachers is demanding but at least there are clear lines of authority and they all share common goals three years ago the government introduced every child matters aimed at improving childrens life chances through joinedup services for the first time childcare education training health policing and social services were expected to work together often in schools headteachers found themselves managing relationships with all sorts of agencies of which they had little understanding with which they had no shared objectives and over which they had no control on top of that many felt they were offered no help and were expected just to get on with it thats why following a successful pilot the national college for school leadership ncsl is unveiling the first multiagency training scheme this summer designed to help teachers police officers health experts and social workers to transcend organisational boundaries and work together this course aims to help them deal better with people from bodies that may have conflicting priorities different ways of working and even different vocabularies says david kelly senior programme manager at the ncsl the course six days of training spread over six months takes a lowkey approach its not about grand overarching themes and acquiring new bodies of knowledge says kelly its about very specific local initiatives and simple teambuilding skills it will be open to any multidisciplinary team the only proviso being that it must include one school and at least three other agencies the intention is to help practitioners implement projects that are already under way a pilot group from loughborough primary school in south london sent a team consisting of two interim coheads a family services manager two governors a police sergeant two speech therapists a learning mentor a family support worker and the practice manager of a health centre wed just finished building a new childrens centre but to get the best out of it we needed to work closely with local police health workers adult literacy people and so on says cohead elena mauro the trouble was that there were no recognised ways of dealing with them and few existing relationships to build on the course forged those who attended into a team with a common purpose says cohead jo eade and cooperation is producing ideas and initiatives for instance it was only when the two coheads chatted with the police representative that they found out their area is a hot spot for domestic violence women were afraid to be seen visiting the counselling centre now that some counselling is done in the school uptake of that service has increased says mauro but its not only teachers who have found the course useful i was amazed to learn how dedicated and enthusiastic other disciplines are without that teambuilding we wouldnt be able to use the school as a hub for community health projects such as lifestyle clinics for smoking weight control and even diabetes says colin paget practice manager at a local health centre it was definitely worthwhile agrees sergeant toby mcdaniels

after refurbishing her home and suffering some wearying problems with workmen hafida sarachi a mother of two came up with an idea that would radically change her life keen to spend more time with her sons sam three and ben seven she left her career in the it industry to set up her own business handygirl offering home repairs and makeovers in her local area almost a year after the launch sarachi has built a thriving enterprise in wiltshire employing four female workers and an apprentice best of all she is now able to work much more flexibly and to spend more time with her children she stresses that this is partly because she is not attempting to grow her business too fast having a child does keep you on a straight line she says their safety and happiness is very important the business will carry on and be there tomorrow sarachis story fits well with the governments new drive for women to set up in business targeting mothers in their s as well as women in their s who are caring for ageing parents entrepreneurship is being sold as the solution to that elusive quest for flexibility and balance last month the trade minister margaret hodge announced plans to recruit established female entrepreneurs to go out and inspire other women to start their own businesses noting that there would be threequarters of a million more businesses in the uk if we matched us levels of female entrepreneurship assuming that women embrace the idea and that it genuinely makes their juggling act more viable the initiative has not come a moment too soon after all the recent equalities review showed that mothers of young children face more discrimination in the workplace than any other group those with children under are less likely to be employed than men and single mothers fare even worse being less likely to be employed is entrepreneurship a realistic solution for working mothers though even those of us who cant tell a spreadsheet from a bedsheet know that startups consume time and energy at a hungry unpredictable rate and time is a commodity that mothers with young children simply do not have and then there are the financial obstacles a study by the university of warwick found that female entrepreneurs are being charged an extra interest on bank loans compared with their male counterparts hodge has announced that she plans to tackle this pointing out that women are much more riskaverse than men if it costs them more to borrow thats another barrier that stops us seeing their potential in the meantime though this institutional sexism is seriously offputting it certainly seems that more and more mothers are exploring the idea of entrepreneurship erika watson is executive director of prowess an organisation that supports women starting their own businesses she is sure that flexibility is a key driver for female entrepreneurs citing the fact that almost half of women start their enterprises parttime and that the alternative option of shifting to parttime employment means far lower pay and a career glass ceiling working for yourself can for rational women be the sensible option she says because it can be done on your own terms and there is a reasonable chance of being able to earn a decent income these arguments are catching on watson points to the enormous success of a new inspirational business mum category in the recent prowess business awards the category proved by far the most popular of any in the contest attracting more than entries the vast majority of whom conduct their work around school hours but while women such as sarachi happily tread the businessmotherhood tightrope others find it more difficult alison beadnell a former patterncutter for the designer ally capellino gave up teaching at the london college of fashion to set up barmy a childrens clothing label beadnell who has a sixyearold son at school and a threeyearold daughter at home hoped her business would use her skills offer her career satisfaction and still allow her to spend time with her children instead she found herself sewing garments late into the night and attempting to sell her products while her daughter was having her lunchtime nap whats that expression burn the candle at both ends and youll end up getting burned she says wryly because i worked from home and only had two days paid childcare a week there was always a temptation to go upstairs in the evening and do a bit more i ended up with at least one day at the weekend where my husband would have to have the children i was constantly dealing with the guilt of being a bad mother or being cross with the children all the time i was just trying to do too much and not doing anything well enough last november beadnell decided to put her monthold business on the back burner and return to teaching although she still does some freelance designing the enterprise had broken even but had not made a profit putting family finances under strain what really made her stop though she says was the thought that i wasnt going to have this time again to be with the children it seems that the business world can provide some solutions for mothers but it is not the panacea that some hope for i dont think encouraging mums into business is the magic wand the government thinks it is says nadine lewis a mother of three and founder of identikids a successful company that sells identity wristbands lewis gave up her job as a human resources manager when the cost of childcare for her baby twins now seven and daughter now nine proved prohibitive running a small business is hard work with children in the background she says and the hours are still destroying it takes two or three years before you make any sort of profit at all because everything has to be reinvested in the business nevertheless lewis whose company had a turnover of in believes her decision to move to selfemployment has helped her to see more of her children she takes most holidays off and can attend school events although she acknowledges that ironically the success of her enterprise is now threatening her time again the key issue she suggests is what kind of business women want to run if a business is small and homebased and someone is doing it as a lifestyle choice then yes it can provide a balance but id say it was a mixed bag id say the key was always to be flexible and not to set things in stone if people think they are going to work from home and make lots of money overnight thats not going to happen lewis a relative veteran with five years in business echoes many of those involved in supporting womens enterprise calling on the government to put its money where its mouth is when urging women to go it alone she points out that the childcare tax breaks on offer to employees are not available for selfemployed women who also miss out on decent maternity pay and all the other securities of employment erika watson at prowess agrees the organisations research suggests that grants for womens businesses have fallen dramatically from per enterprise three years ago to today the government is right that women look to other women for inspiration and mentoring she says but without highquality financial support their businesses which traditionally grow more slowly than those run by men are less likely to succeed despite all the obstacles though watson is convinced that running a business can be a liberating opportunity for many women it can be very powerful in creating selfesteem and helping you cope with other problems some people compare it to alchemy she notes creating something out of nothing,2007-03,refurbishing home suffering wearying problem workman hafida sarachi mother two came idea would radically change life keen spend time son sam

next month the gender equality duty comes into force from april all uk public authorities will have to demonstrate that they are promoting equality for women and men and are eliminating sexual discrimination and harassment the public sector is a more womenfriendly employer than most with women holding a quarter of top jobs in the public and voluntary sectors compared to just of large company directors but in some parts of the public sector things are going in the wrong direction in a little over a year the number of female permanent secretaries in the civil service has shrunk from seven to three of these only helen ghosh permanent secretary at the department for environment food and rural affairs heads a major whitehall department in all of the most senior civil servants at director general level or above only are women although two departments are bucking the trend the home office has more women on the board than men and six women at the level of director general while the department of health also has more senior women than most they are the exception to the rule most departments have only one or two top jobs filled by women and the ministry of defence and the department of culture media and sport have no female director general at all in local government progress in improving diversity has also been at a snails pace although the numbers of female local authority chief executives has grown from in to that proportion is still very low female council leaders are even more of a minority only are women in contrast figures from the equal opportunities commission show that of chief executives of voluntary organisations nearly of health service chief executives and of senior public appointments are women and women hold a third of top jobs in professional bodies such as the general teaching council and general medical council some try to blame the lack of progress in central and local government on generational issues arguing that as many permanent secretaries leaders and chief executives are in their s more familyfriendly policies probably did not benefit their generation as a whole so there are simply not as many senior women to choose from but this is nonsense top jobs in the health service and voluntary organisations also tend to be held by those in their late s and s if women can make it there why not in councils and the civil service a more likely explanation is that women are put off by the politics in the higher echelons of whitehall and local government there is still evidence of resistance to womens voices in the civil service while the notion of selfpromotion disadvantages women many find it difficult to put themselves forward and when they do so they are often disliked for acting like a man female managers also tend to place greater importance on good working relationships than men so are more likely to give way in discussions as a result it is harder for them to be seen as leadership material yet more adversarial women too often tend to be sidelined there are also structural issues it is still very rare for senior women in the civil service to work part time some are put off trying to get into the senior ranks because it is harder to manage flexible working in contrast because the health and voluntary sectors have a reputation for offering a better worklife balance they attract more senior women this has created something of a brain drain with women leaving to work in other sectors where it is easier to get the top job more easily and yet also retain some sort of worklife balance until there is a critical mass of women in senior positions in central and local government these offputting working practices are unlikely to disappear but for that to happen there needs to be a change in culture the government is trying to do something about this situation the cabinet secretary sir gus odonnell has come up with a point plan on equality and initiatives to attract and retain talented women are mushrooming throughout the public sector but while high development schemes and mentoring arrangements are a positive step local and central government need to do more to showcase those women who have made it without role models the danger is that women may wrongly assume they cannot make it to the top and that would be a shame anna bawden is assistant editor of the guardians public

its not the number of early learning goals nor the development milestones and the skills and attitudes children should acquire that alarm one there are just as many boxes to tick in every one of the many baby gurus guides to raising children its the way in which such testing and driving forward is going to be achieved in the many nursery settings that are already delivering a jalopy of a service to children and parents or to put it another way government is pretending in its early years foundation curriculum is your baby gurgling on cue that a rolls royce service can be produced from a sector whose standards are hugely variable to expect so much while investing so little is not just hypocritical it is dangerous to childrens wellbeing ten years ago gordon brown bought the womens vote cheaply when he promised that childcare would come in from the economic cold and become part of the mainstream in government policy the national childcare strategy was announced and launched with a fatal flaw in spite of measures such as working family tax credit the desperately poor investment in childcare several years on is achieving the reverse of what was intended creating inequality we now have threetier childcare in deprived areas where entrepreneurs are loath to tread and where single parents are being pushed into paid work there is a desperate shortage of childcare places nurseries that do open often fold within years because of a lack of sustainable funding next we have the midtier nurseries on which families struggling to meet fees of between and a week rely they are being squeezed by the top bracket nurseries who are poaching their staff because they can afford to pay the correct salaries that the cheaper nurseries cant even begin to match in all but the highpriced nurseries there is the continuing issue of inadequately qualified staff and a high turnover plus a mishmash of funding the bottom line of which is parents pay a disproportionately high percentage of their income a sum that is still insufficient without increased employergovernment investment to improve standards basically the nursery ticks over but its the children and babies who bear the brunt dealing with constantly changing faces and halfinterested adults of course against the odds there are some superb nurseries but even they struggle the governmentrequired staff ratio over the age of three is to compare that to a mother or father at home with a couple of children or a childminder with three or four as steven alexander chief executive of the preschool learning alliance the countrys largest voluntary provider of childcare says a better ratio would be to given that the new framework stipulates that assessments of children have to be made by observation look listen and note it may be an unexpected bonus but rather than deliver quality of care for children and parents this new framework may well expose the mess that much of the national childcare strategy has become if government can sit down and plan strategically in the long term on green issues it should surely be possible to commit themselves to building a highquality system of childcare meaning that it produces happy wellbalanced children that is accessible to all those who wish to use it at a price they can afford that means government and employers paying a higher proportion of costs nurseries as in new zealand given incentives to improve the qualifications of their staff a degreeled profession of pedagogues hopefully beginning to emerge in childrens centres who are paid in line with teachers with improved status and regular monitoring and inspection of all childcare establishments not the inadequate scrutiny that exists now that strategy should have been in place when gordon brown first used the word childcare on a public platform in denmark such changes took years to phase in labour has now lost while david cameron judging from his muddled view on parents choices doesnt even begin to understand that childcare plays a vital part in the jigsaw puzzle of the modern economy as it is too many toddlers are going to be expected to deliver passing their baby baccalaureate without the care encouragement and fun that makes development a natural part of being a child stress and cortisol levels we havent seen anything yet a genuine national childcare strategy doesnt have to be a fairy

question what is the one thing you would most like to see happen by this time next year among some guardian readers i am considered a manhater nothing could be further from the truth i only despise men who abuse women and children or who allow that abuse to happen i would not be a feminist if i did not think men have the potential to grow up as decent nonviolent individuals my type of feminism is that which proclaims that women are not inherently good or men biologically bad if we had the chance to rear children in a world which was not dependent on maintaining polarised gender roles and where men did not get away with rape and murder of women on a vast scale we might all have a chance to live among each other in harmony and happiness i want to see an end to gender it has no place in my world but to end this tyranny of learned masculinity and femininity where boys and girls are taught that they should behave in ways befitting of their birthright we need the oppressors men to be the ones who say enough is enough like some radical white south africans wishing to see an end to apartheid gave up their power for the benefit of humanity so should men you may find that free of the constraints that masculinity brings you can live free human beings and know at the same time you have contributed to the freedom of women for other blogs in cifs first anniversary series click here,2007-03,question one thing would like see happen time next year among guardian reader considered manhater nothing could truth despise men abuse woman child allow abuse happen would feminist think men potential grow decent nonviolent individual type feminism proclaims woman inherently good men biologically bad chance rear child world wa dependent maintaining polarised gender role men get away rape murder woman vast scale might chance live among harmony happiness want see end gender ha place world end tyranny learned masculinity femininity boy girl taught behave way befitting birthright need oppressor men one say enough enough like radical white south african wishing see end apartheid gave power benefit humanity men may find free constraint masculinity brings live free human know time contributed freedom woman blog cifs first anniversary series click,"['question', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'happen', 'time', 'next', 'year', 'among', 'guardian', 'reader', 'considered', 'manhater', 'nothing', 'could', 'truth', 'despise', 'men', 'abuse', 'woman', 'child', 'allow', 'abuse', 'happen', 'would', 'feminist', 'think', 'men', 'potential', 'grow', 'decent', 'nonviolent', 'individual', 'type', 'feminism', 'proclaims', 'woman', 'inherently', 'good', 'men', 'biologically', 'bad', 'chance', 'rear', 'child', 'world', 'wa', 'dependent', 'maintaining', 'polarised', 'gender', 'role', 'men', 'get', 'away', 'rape', 'murder', 'woman', 'vast', 'scale', 'might', 'chance', 'live', 'among', 'harmony', 'happiness', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'gender', 'ha', 'place', 'world', 'end', 'tyranny', 'learned', 'masculinity', 'femininity', 'boy', 'girl', 'taught', 'behave', 'way', 'befitting', 'birthright', 'need', 'oppressor', 'men', 'one', 'say', 'enough', 'enough', 'like', 'radical', 'white', 'south', 'african', 'wishing', 'see', 'end', 'apartheid', 'gave', 'power', 'benefit', 'humanity', 'men', 'may', 'find', 'free', 'constraint', 'masculinity', 'brings', 'live', 'free', 'human', 'know', 'time', 'contributed', 'freedom', 'woman', 'blog', 'cifs', 'first', 'anniversary', 'series', 'click']",195
the following correction was printed in the guardians corrections and clarifications column tuesday march the proposal from the department for education and skills for monitoring children from birth to age five applies only to england and not to the whole of britain as stated in error in the report below babies will be assessed on their gurgling babbling and toeplaying abilities when they are a few months old under a legally enforced national curriculum for children from birth to five published by the government yesterday every nursery childminder and reception class in britain will have to monitor childrens progress towards a set of governmentset early learning goals recording them against more than development milestones as they go at five each child will be assessed against scales based on the learning goals and their score called an early years profile must be passed to the department for education and skills when children enter compulsory schooling they should be able to read simple sentences using a phonicsbased approach count reliably up to and sing simple songs from memory as well as respecting others beliefs and learning to share and take turns the early years foundation curriculum which comes into effect from september replaces nonstatutory guidance already in place if nurseries or other care providers want to opt out of the new requirements for example because they follow an educational philosophy that introduces reading at a later age they will have to apply for an exemption and would have to forfeit any state funding the department for education and skillss framework immediately came under attack from the national confederation of parent teacher associations ncpta and from the tories for taking an excessively prescriptive approach and targeting children far too young margaret morrissey of the ncpta said i think its really sad that we have reached the point now where instead of reducing childrens stress we have increased it it worries me that we are expecting children to reach these targets when they have not even had their first birthday anne mcintosh shadow minister for children condemned the framework as formalised learning for very small children that risked damaging youngsters development she said it is inappropriate to have such detailed inspection of children this young we should leave it to the professional judgment of teachers these new targets mark an unprecedented supervision of children from birth to primary school and i do not think that they are necessary or will work every child is different and develops at different stages in different ways the dfes says the framework is a means of ensuring high standards of early education and care that will reassure parents that their childs development is being supported no matter what form of childcare or preschool education they use beverley hughes the childrens minister denied the goals would lead to a tickbox approach to assessing children though she acknowledged this had happened under the previous system she rejected suggestions that a page set of practice guidance featuring skills and attitudes children should acquire which accompanies the framework was excessively detailed i dont think it is prescriptive i think the examples we have got in there are really what brings it to life for practitioners she said the framework document was intended for nursery staff to make sure they adopt a rigorous approach the childrens experience will be free it will be based on play it will be rich ms hughes said but the professionals behind that are required to have a thinking approach to the care of other peoples children scrutiny according to the practice guidance babies from birth to months should be assessed for the different ways babies communicate such as gurgling when happy as they begin to scrutinise the skills children need for writing carers should note the interest infants show in the marks they make when they rub a rusk round the tray of a feeding chair in preparation for learning about numbers babies will be monitored on whether they enjoy finding their nose eyes or tummy childcare groups broadly welcomed the framework but warned that moves to support childrens development by close observation could be jeopardised by government rules stating that one member of staff can look after up to children aged three and over steve alexander chief executive of the preschool learning alliance the countrys largest voluntary provider of childcare said we retain our strong view that the staff to child ratio of is too low and should be this point has particular pertinence given the framework stipulates that assessments through the foundation stage take the form of observation via look listen and note purnima tanuku chief executive of national day nurseries association said we question how practitioners will be able to give children the right support they need to progress in their learning and development with such a high ratio now pay attention what your offspring should be doing and when birth months communicate in a variety of ways including crying gurgling babbling and screaming play with their own fingers and toes and focus on objects around them discover markmaking by chance noticing for instance that trailing a finger through spilt juice changes it eight months become absorbed in putting objects in and out of containers get to know and enjoy daily routines such as getting up time meal times nappy time and bed time months begin to move to music listen to or join in with rhymes or songs express feelings within warm mutual affirmative relationships make random marks with their fingers and some tools months have some understanding of the numbers one and two especially when the quantity is important for them show increasing control in holding and using hammers books beaters and markmaking tools months be able to use simple statements and questions often linked to gestures form

the meeting room at the department for education and skills booked for ruth pimentel national director of the foundation stage contains a single picture of a road winding off into the distance its an appropriate backdrop for someone at the start of an month journey overseeing the introduction of the new comprehensive framework governing the care and learning of children in england from birth to the end of reception the early years foundation stage eyfs being launched today will become obligatory in september for all ofstedregistered early years settings compared to some other recent initiatives this is a generous timescale she says but the scale of the exercise cannot be underestimated it will affect the work of over childminders and some schools childrens centres and nurseries farreaching reforms despite the workload pimentel is buoyant pointing out the extent to which local authorities already have established networks for disseminating such farreaching educational reforms creating a more qualified early years sector is one of the key ingredients it is expected that everyone registered to cater to this sector will have or be studying towards an nvq childcare qualification by the september kickoff to assist with this process we are collaborating with the childrens workforce development council to create a series of study units geared around aspects of the eyfs which the qca will be giving nvq accreditation says pimentel among the benefits of such training is a smoothing out of the variations in quality of care and learning children receive and the creation of a more stable pool of early years specialists there is a m transformation fund over two years to smooth the arrival of the eyfs and there may also be general sure start funds as for the cost implications for practitioners pimentel is noncommittal it depends where a setting is starting out from we have for example emphasised the importance of it in the early years we never say you must have but settings do need to rise to the challenge of mirroring what is happening in the outside world and a key factor in the eyfs is that it should encourage detailed communication with parents and comprehensive recordkeeping of childrens achievement something that digital photography can capture particularly well recording process as well as the end results the discussion shifts quickly to issues of assessment the eyfs attracted some unfavourable headlines when first announced critics said tests for tots were being proposed but nothing could be further from the truth pimentel says the framework lays down assessment criteria designed to capture teachers evaluations of such things as their childrens physical and creative development communication and mathematical skills and core to everything is the recognition that care and learning cannot be falsely divided laying the foundation pimentel continues lets make no mistake the introduction of the eyfs is momentous it marks an explicit commitment in legislation stipulating what local authorities should be doing to support our youngest children it is recognition that if we can get it right for all young people between birth and five then we are laying down educational and emotional fundamentals that will help them throughout their lives settings where good practice is already well established will probably find the eyfs confirms much that is already established more uncertain is whether it can professionalise the childminding sector and drive improvement in the most deprived areas without significant financial backup the eyfs will have to continue to function as a part of an education system in which resources are weighted towards secondary pupils despite the longerlasting gains quality early years education are known to deliver pimentel has been a reception teacher primary head and once even operated her own village nursery she is in a good position to know the impact the eyfs can achieve but now she heads

there was a period a few years ago when it seemed every report about feminism talked about conflict between the generations the popularity of the trope might be laid at least partly at the door of the apparently irresistible attraction of the word catfight to male journalists but there was some basis in reality inevitably enough a young generation was taking over from their foremothers and that is not an easy transition but judging from the evidence of the fem conference at sheffield at the weekend that period has happily passed as youd expect from an event at a university young women were the largest group of participants but all ages were represented mingling together sharing ideas and experiences and bringing a broad perspective on the issues that seem all too familiar to all having heard from abortion rights on this years th anniversary campaign to remove the twodoctor rule finally giving women full control over their own bodies the session chair had her own reflection helen jackson former local mp remarked when i was at university we were sent down if you became pregnant all of our efforts to ensure access to the family planning association which was supposed to be restricted to married women staying with the experiences of older women the unison representative was talking about the national scandal as identified by the government of womens pensions and the fact that women pensioners receive on average only of the income of male pensioners she spoke of the way it was affecting particularly women in the age group many of whom had still relied on the married womans stamp the young women were listening and it seemed taking heed that reflected one of the great successes of th century feminism to help women to realise that in providing for themselves and their own financial futures they are on their own or at least have to act as if they are but a common accusation against last centurys feminism was that it was a white middleclass movement but this gathering could not be accused of ignoring issues of race or international politics or indeed at least of having good intentions on class a session addressing the needs and problems of women many of whom were moved a few years ago with then scant support in large numbers into this region the session listened with rapt attention as yvonne noble from react spoke about her experience as a south african refugee relocated by the government to barnsley there were gasps of horror as ms noble spoke about the experience of asylumseeking women being interviewed in front of their children about the experiences from which they were seeking refuge since there is no childcare provided the women have a choice of having their children hear tales of their rape or torture or staying silent to the grave danger of their claims as i was leaving the workshop i heard a young student behind me say ive been meaning to do it and now i will do it im going to volunteer at the conversation club she was speaking about a programme of the northern refugee centre that brings refugee and asylumseeking women together for mutual support but the most emotion was flowing in a session with jennifer williams one of the founders of women of zimbabwe arise woza a group with a membership involving tens of thousands of women who work through nonviolent action it was she said founded on the principle of love if we love our country enough we should be able to discipline it as a woman does a child class issues too were at least in evidence in the union presence and the information on the work of the south yorkshire development trust which has a programme trying to get women into nontraditional trades and technology i remember similar schemes in my youth looking at the figures of women in building and engineering precious little has changed in that area and then there was the stall from sova which is doing the really hard yards in helping women leaving prison to find jobs asked about gender violence in zimbabwe the woza representative said she could not deny that it happened but it was confronted within the grassroots movement we have a saying she said strike a woman and you have struck a rock in sheffield at the weekend many such rocks were being bound together into a solid structure for feminism in the st century those whod like to label this a postfeminist age might like to think again many of the activists and workers here might not be involved in work labelled explicitly feminist but they are working solidly persistently sometimes angrily to undo injustice to support oppressed women to balance the gender scales and thats feminism whatever label it might bear and they are building on the walls left by those who came before plastered all over the toilets at the student union were signs reminding of the special nightbus service that after latenight events takes female students safely home to their door at no more cost than the excellent local tram service and walking out of the union i noticed that there are not just womens cricket football and basketball teams but mens teams as well an improvement from my day when the mens teams were the norm requiring no

it has long seemed to me that one of the most fascinating of contemporary topics is the interaction or usually lack of it between western feminism and islam though maybe in this context what were really talking about is purblind conservatism the subject cropped up with force in italy this week because of the case of hina saleem the daughter of a pakistani immigrant saleem was killed in the northern city of brescia last august her father and three other relatives are in jail awaiting trial for her murder hina a waitress had embraced the western way of life with alacrity she had an italian boyfriend and dressed like so many other italian girls of her generation in jeans and skimpy clingy tops the prosecution case against her father is that he was so appalled by her behaviour he decided to do away with her her throat was cut and she was buried in a shallow grave in the saleems back garden i thought hina would become a symbol for italian women loredana gemelli said this week ms gemelli who describes herself as a lifelong leftwinger is to represent ms saleems boyfriend at the trial but on thursday which was international womens day she stepped out of her normal role to give an interview to corriere della sera decrying the fact that womens groups had in fact shown no interest whatsoever in either hina or the trial far from joining themselves to the civil suit ms gemelli had brought feminist associations had not lifted a finger she said her explanation which at least one noted feminist agreed with is that italys womens groups all of the left were scared witless of seeming racist or antiimmigrant this is not really a story about italy at all another woman commentator said feminist groups in germany had reacted in a similarly paralysed fashion to the case of a lawyer of turkish origin who had been beaten up for defending the rights of muslim women so if feminists and the left are not going to help who will the case of hina saleem offers a possible answer it was not till last month that she was buried only one woman apart from loredana gemelli turned out for her funeral her name is daniela santanche and she is a member of the italian parliament for the postfascist national alliance for anyone who regards himself or herself as liberal that is cringemakingly shameful,2007-03,ha long seemed one fascinating contemporary topic interaction usually

in honour of international womens day in restorers placed a crown of mimosa flowers on the head of michelangelos david photographer franco origliagetty images i was offered some at the station top quality the sri lankan dealer assured me i had to go to the dentist today the nurse grumbled that she hadnt been given any by her boss he muttered that thank god hed remembered to give some to his wife im talking of mimosa of course as one of the readers of zoe williamss latest blog mentioned yesterday giving and receiving it is the italian orginally im told roman way of celebrating international womens day and no one to my knowledge celebrates lotto marzo quite as much as the italians on my way from the tram i passed any number of pleasedlooking women and girls clutching bunches of the acidyellow flowers the receptionist at the newspaper where i work had some on her desk all of which had me thinking that this was pretty ironic for there is perhaps no country on earth where such a vast gap exists between on the one hand the degree to which women are pampered and on the other the extent to which they are disadvantaged and exploited italian women are indulged with more than just mimosa they start as endlessly admired bambine and move on to being belle ragazze all girls in italy being belle as of right unless as a cab driver once solemnly informed my wife they are affascinanti they then progress to the semidivine status of mamme before retiring to a comfortable place in the honoured cohorts of the nonne grandmothers yet theirs is not a life i would take on for all the truffles in piedmont no matter what indicator of womens status you choose you will find italy at or near the bottom in europe i recently saw a table showing italian women had less representation in parliament than in morocco their rockbottom fertility rate bears witness to the virtual impossibility of combining the roles of wife mother and fulltime employee in a society where the vast majority of men refuse to take on household duties the depiction of women in advertising here manges to combines st century explicitness with midth century insensitivity current offerings include a naked crawling model with her bottom in the air who is used to sell air conditioning and a peroni beer ad that departs from the premise that pretty girls cant park cars perhaps the lesson of all this is that male chauvinists elsewhere in the world have been on the wrong track all along maybe instead of trying to confront feminism intellectually a la norman mailer or exalting laddishness

women are jumping off the career ladder long before they hit the glass ceiling raising serious questions about attempts to increase the number of female executives in company boardrooms an analysis of the number of women in senior management positions in the biggest companies listed on the stock market shows a dramatic fall in the last five years according to new research published today pricewaterhousecoopers which commissioned the research believes that the increasing cost of childcare and a newfound entrepreneurial streak in women may be among the factors for a fall in women holding senior management positions this is a wakeup call for the ftse companies in britain said sarah churchman head of diversity at pwc they are creating problems for the future women are exiting corporate life meg munn deputy minister for women said its disappointing that uk businesses are putting themselves at a real disadvantage by not selecting the best executives from the largest talent pool possible the government recently launched an action plan to close the gender pay gap creating more quality parttime roles is key to increasing the number of women in senior roles which can extend a companys portfolio of skills provide role models for younger high potential women and place companies closer to their customer base in recent years there have been repeated attempts to encourage women to remain in work and to entice more of them into top level positions but successive reports show that this does not appear to be happening the annual analysis of ftse companies by cranfield university school of management found that the number of directorships held by women fell in after rising steadily in previous years the equal opportunities commission has also found that women are missing from top slots and reckons a lack of flexibility might be driving women towards setting up their own businesses the governments labour force survey appears to support this for the first time there are million selfemployed women in the workplace and the number of selfemployed women has increased by in five years pwc notes that the findings of its research based on data from pwcs monks pay survey which holds information on roles follows attempts by companies to introduce flexible working arrangements as well as appointing heads of diversity in an attempt to address inequalities jackie brierton director of policy for prowess which supports women starting new businesses believes there is anecdotal evidence to support the idea women are setting up on their own this is the first survey ive seen which appears to show this she said we find that when women have a family they find life in big privatesector companies is not feasible theres not enough flexibility she points out that men also opt out of corporate life to set up on their own but when they do they tend to be leaving higherranking positions and have more money to support their endeavours pwc also notes the cost of childcare is rising which might also explain why women are leaving the workplace the cost of a typical nursery place in england has risen in the past five years according to the daycare trust which may be pushing the cost of childcare beyond the means of those in less senior roles those in top executive roles are likely to have larger disposable incomes they are better able to meet the considerable financial commitments of flexible childcare needed to follow a highflying career and raise a family at the same time said ms churchman last weeks report from the equalities review commissioned by tony blair showed that mothers find themselves at or close to the bottom in every type of workplace the pwc research found that among ftse companies in almost of senior management posts were occupied by women when that research was repeated for this year the number of senior management posts held by women had fallen to just the survey analyses a number of rankings of jobs chief executive or chairman deputy chief executive board director executive committee head of function and senior manager when the analysis is repeated for head of function in companies in the ftse the biggest companies outside the ftse there is a similar exodus in of head of function posts were held by women while this had fallen to this year however the research finds that among britains top stock marketlisted companies there are now more women in head of function roles which means they have someone reporting to them than there were in five years ago of these positions were held by women while this has now increased to the smaller number of women holding senior management posts in the ftse is regarded as significant since these are the women who might one day reach boardroom level however the monks data shows the number of women at boardroom level has risen albeit from a low base in the ftse the number of fulltime chairwomen and female chief executives has risen from one to three while the number of female executive committee members has risen from to pwc also produces evidence of rising pay equality in the ftse function heads are now earning of their male counterparts compared with five years ago while in the ftse parity has now been achieved this leads pwc to conclude that there are more intricate forces at play than a pure quest for pay equality it is much harder to tackle the cultural and external financial issues that drive peoples behaviour and life choices companies need to work hard to ensure that talented people have every opportunity to continue their careers as their circumstances and needs change throughout their working lives said ms churchman women at the top are making some progress but at this rate there is going to be a limited pipeline from the next generation to follow this up she said breaking into the boardroom when pricewaterhousecoopers conducted an audit of senior employees three years ago about promotion to its partnership it found men were twice as likely as women to reach its highest echelons it now hopes to have addressed the anomalies moira elms pictured left is one who had already broken through the ranks the only female on the accountants management board she became a partner in there is an element of luck in reaching the top of your profession she said but in an organisation like ours working with people who dont have preconceptions helps she adds she says that while some people grasp the equality issues on intellectual grounds its what they get in their hearts that matters she has had two children and since becoming a partner and says that arguably the more senior the women the easier it gets the more senior you are the more able you are to throw money at the problem ms elms says she tries to give junior women advice i tell them to stop feeling guilty about not being able to do everything she also acknowledges her position as a role model for instance when it comes to setting meeting times to suit home life if youve got somebody senior saying it and doing it it sets the tone she said,2007-03,woman jumping career ladder long hit glass ceiling raising serious question attempt increase number

i wonder when well be able to not mention women in lisbon council conclusions hardly a shocking statement but none the less a surprising one given it was uttered by a highly successful woman diplomat in brussels and even then the surprise was that she had the guts to say it out loud albeit over a private lunch rather than maintain the party line that the rhetoric is wonderful the short answer to her question as she well knows is simple when women achieve parity as a matter of course the long answer explains why this simple goal is so difficult to achieve not least at policy level and why most women simply lose interest a lisbon council is basically one that deals with economic and social affairs and what my friend the diplomat was referring to was the habit of adding women to every issue in the eu the un national government documents and all such there are to be better levels of employment for all and women too there is to be better access to education and women must have access too governments must meet the demands of its citizens and women too and so it goes on it is sickening women are everyone they shouldnt need to be singled out they should just be treated equally in every way but theyre not then there is the lumping problem in these declarations and in most discourse of the social affairs world women are lumped together with any other special needs group in the un there are debates on human rights and debates on womens rights which take place alongside debates on children the handicapped and all the miserable of the world everyone is a human and human rights should cover us all but apparently not and it is demeaning in to think that women are viewed in the same light as the handicapped who need special protection by definition all of which leads to today international womens day a case in point a special space in which to celebrate women and highlight their achievements which are often overshadowed in the general maledominated mainstream but at the same time it is also part of the trend a special day to single out women and discuss their situation outside of the mainstream it is at this point of the long explanation that many humans i mean men start to say make up your mind you women fought to be included in everything you women wanted womens day not us now youve got it and youre still complaining well yes because the problem is not that women need to be special and remembered for their contribution the problem is that women are still not being given the space and chances they need and deserve and however important womens day is about talking not about changing anything women will go on marches prime ministers will address conferences and tour special exhibitions the media will have an item or two and sweet fa will be done im sure the overwhelming majority of women if anyone bothered to ask them would happily trade the fiesta for a truly level playing field but heres the problem its not on offer which is why at the end of the day you cant cancel womens day or stop the social affairs jargon women obviously need to be singled out because they are yet to achieve parity on practically any count but education in the western world they still make less per hour for the same work they are still promoted less despite doing equal quality work they are still a minority on executive boards of ftse companies they still have to fight really hard to break through glass ceilings and in many places they still have to fight to be taken as seriously as men in national governments and the eu included in brussels the two combine since meps are elected from member states and senior appointments like commissioners are national appointments the result not too bad at top tier level since of meps and commissioners are women not parity but a big improvement however move down a level and disaster in the commission only one out of directors general is a woman plus the secretary general of the commission secretariat whilst in the eu council only one out eight is a woman indeed the council is something of a black hole for women since out of nine eu special representatives individuals who act as high level diplomats in crisis areas none are women and since all of these are member state appointees rather than eu bureaucrats the fault lies squarely with the governments indeed the member states are in a bad way for women as the eu heads of state line up for their council group photo today we will see only one woman there angela merkel of germany need one say more the bean counting can go on ad infinitum and its always dispiriting because the point remains the same there is no parity for women and it starts at the top at government eu and policy level therefore however demeaning and fatiguing and often simply boring there is no option for women other than to harp on about it single themselves out and agree to be singled out however patronisingly and demeaningly because if not they will be totally ignored but in so doing they are party to the lumping and in danger of compartmentalizing themselves into a special space it is a never ending cycle which most women sensibly ignore and simply go out every day and do their best even if that never seems to be good enough to gain them parity,2007-03,wonder well able mention woman lisbon council conclusion hardly shocking statement none less surprising one

lets start by running through how different organisations have chosen to mark tomorrows international womens day the greater london authority had an event last weekend with bike workshops selfdefence classes some kind of spicecentric cookery display and a fashion show by kulturecouture which covers all bases by designing clothes for women and hinting at urban attitude with its poor spelling tomorrow in westminster hilary benn chairs a panel of global experts addressing womens rights in the age of insecurity and two charity heavyweights mary wandia of actionaid and grace mukasa of vso discuss the hiv crisis meanwhile in a talk entitled animals in art successful female artist sally matthews discusses the role of animals in art hazel blears sent out a release reminding us that david cameron pretends to be prowomen yet his last candidate selections have been male and the ayr bonnie lassies promise a funfilled day of dancing from around the world yoga storytelling and it i want to take the piss but i dont know where to start lets take it as read that the feminist movement has traditionally covered three issues women in public life access to the legislature education and politics women in private health sexual and other domestic violence and the point of intersection between these two worlds rape conviction rates provision for victims of domestic violence abortion rights and government decisions about other health matters the primacy of each issue depends on the treatment of women in a country where women are fighting just to keep or get the vote or retain access to education in the face of bigotry under say the taliban then access to abortion services will naturally take second place this isnt a relativistic issue abortion rights are as important in afghanistan as in accrington its just a pragmatic point that everything filters down from ones democratic rights in other words i am not saying that there should be total homogeneity in what we discuss on womens day even though the prominence of female mps in the conservative party might seem trivial to the head of an ngo fresh from shariaordered stonings in nigeria that does not mean it is not worth highlighting the threat to abortion rights in america is not as great a violation of womens liberties as deaths from unsafe abortion in subsaharan africa but protesting about the first injustice is the way to prevent its deterioration to the level of the second what is not relevant is funpacked dancing from around the world spice workshops and fashion shows fashion is to international womens rights as agassi kitchen utensils are to gay rights yes some women are interested in fashion some gay men own more than one brightly coloured fish slice but it is an outrage against people who take liberties seriously who embody the core of feminism by interpreting it as a war that hasnt been won until its been won for all women to trivialise these matters it could not matter less if yoga is good for you or women have a connection with the moon or theres some very interesting storytelling going on in ayr what matters enormously is the impact on the enterprise as a whole when it expands to cover animals in art its this kind of hijacking of meaningful collective action that did for the womens movement in the first place that made todays young women think you could believe in equal pay as a regular person but as soon as you called yourself a feminist you had to stop shaving your legs and start eating pulses tell stories and dance as much as you will but

so ofsted says nurseries must let boys be boys and allow them freer rein to satisfy their appetite for physical outdoor play its state of the foundation stage report published today the first major survey for more than five years shows that the educational gender gap is starting younger and it argues that boyunfriendly teaching is to blame staff must increase their awareness of the impact of boys choices of play activity on their progress it says and help them to achieve more rapidly by providing opportunities for learning that engage them it is well known that the preschool workforce is almost exclusively female largely because the work has such low status but before pointing the finger at women who just dont get boys as education correspondent alexandra blair does in the times remember some of the leading critics of antiboy teaching practice are themselves women and feminists to boot early years researcher penny holland describes in her fascinating book we dont play with guns here what goes wrong when staff overreact to boisterous play from boys blanket bans on what she calls war weapon and superhero play leave the frustrated perpetrators deprived of valuable learning opportunities then adding insult to injury they get labelled as trouble makers early years experts will say ofsteds report shows a clear need for more better qualified staff male or female it doesnt matter who have a clearer grasp of the richness and complexity of how both boys and girls learn some also blame the growing political clamour to see the results of all the increased public funding going into the sector psychologist and writer jennie lindon describes how ignorance of child development combined with significant pressures to provide economic value has sometimes created a kind of educational bullying that risks derailing good practice with young children i think lindon is right look more closely at the ofsted report and what becomes clear is just how much pressure early years educators are under its strongest warning is about childrens speaking and listening skills which were weak in onethird of settings it says that more attention needs to be given to calculation early reading and writing a sense of time and place an understanding of culture and beliefs and imaginative play oh and also better assessment more challenging teaching for the most able children and more support for children transferring from one class to the next this is one hell of a shopping list and here i part company with lindon surely it is time to take a step back from the detail of early education and ask what is going on in young childrens lives after all long before pioneering philosopher and educationalist john dewey first coined the phrase pedagogical fallacy we have known that children do not get all their learning from teachers previous generations gained many of the items on ofsteds list simply by being given enough time and space to play engaging largely on their own terms with the objects people and places around them so is the feminist conspiracy to blame by urging working mothers to shunt their offspring into childcare instead of staying at home enriching their lives that may or may not be a factor my own view is that the biggest reason behind the extinction of childhood play is not the working mother but the car but whatever your take on childcare or car dependence these are not the only social forces shaping the territory of st century childhoods take a wider look across that landscape and what is most evident is that all the roads take us further away from allowing children to learn through exploratory outdoor play to give just one example last year a manchester housing trust wrote to a parent warning about her sons alleged antisocial behaviour the boys crime playing football near someone elses home his age three years old in effect we as a society are immersing our children in a world of domestication screenfed stimulation and overprotection and then expecting individual parents teachers and childcare workers to pick up the pieces so yes we need better staff and better nurseries the ofsted report says that over of settings inspected had no usable outdoor space and a fifth should be making better use of it and we need to resist the push to inflict inappropriate classroom teaching methods on ever younger children but we also need to tackle headon the policies planning and cultural attitudes that continue to squeeze vital outdoor play and learning experiences from childrens everyday lives,2007-03,ofsted say nursery

single parents will be expected to look for work when their child reaches rather than the current age of under new government plans published today a longawaited report into state welfare provision by sir david freud a city banker was launched this morning by tony blair and the chancellor gordon brown it proposes offering benefit claimants inhouse care for three years after they find work but also calls for more private and voluntary sector involvement in getting people off benefits and into work offering bounty payments for placing the longterm jobless in employment and making sure they stay in work and the report hints that the age limit could go lower than in future years the page document also states that creating a market in welfare providers will take at least six to eight years but that lowering the age limit which applies to the youngest child to should be delivered as soon as is practicable and it calls for the hiving off of difficult to place claimants from the present centres run by jobcentre plus to providers from the private voluntary or charity sector the tuc general secretary brendan barber called that a mistake but welcomed extending injob care for claimants who found work from weeks to three years mr brown speaking at no said the aim of the new proposals was to address the challenge of those hardest to employ and he stressed it was something he would enact if he takes over as prime minister this year saying this starts a new phase of welfare reform which i will champion he also said that the government hoped to get lone parents back to work including with children over mr blair said that in return for the state providing wraparound childcare from am to pm from we need an even greater effort from people on benefit to get back into work reducing the age at which single parents are required to look for work while claiming benefits from to would copy the model of many continental european countries however it sparked concern from charities chris pond director of one parent families said it would be a real mistake to start cajoling lone parents even those with older children into jobs when its just not right for them most lone parents with older children are already working about already have a job those who are not working very often have good reasons for not doing so the report calls for hardtoplace jobseekers to be supported by welfare advisers for three years after finding work in order to counter the revolving door syndrome which sees many back on the dole after only a short period of employment most controversial may be the suggestion of payments to private firms and charities to find jobseekers longterm jobs and keep them there the payments represent a portion of the cash that would otherwise be spent on benefits mr freuds report admits that there is no conclusive evidence that the private sector outperforms the public sector but adds there are clear potential gains from contesting services bringing in innovation with a different skill set he predicts outsourcing will create a annual multibillion market but warns that the department for work and pensions would need to develop a worldclass contracting capability so as to ensure the governments complex social goals were met without compromising the robustness of the outcome focus mr barber said contractingout is a recipe for lower standards and the exploitation of claimants a much better approach would be to allow jobcentre plus managers more flexibility in providing tailored services to help lone parents get jobs instead of penalising them mr blair praised his governments record but stressed if we want to meet the challenges of the future we need to go further if we want to be able to afford our welfare state in the future not just paying people who cannot work a better level of benefit but in particular affording a strong basic state pension for the increasing number of people of retirement age we have got to get even more people off benefit and into work we are going to provide more help for people who want to get off benefit and into work most important of all with by wraparound childcare from eight to six in return we need an even greater effort from people on benefit to get back into work he spoke of an expansion of the private voluntary and charity sectors in delivering work programmes for people mr blair and mr brown said the aim was to achieve an employment rate of of those able to work jobcentres are already facing largescaled redundancies as part of the gershon review an examination of efficiency in the public sector published in mark serwotka general secretary of the civil services public and commercial services union said jobcentre staff will see this as a kick in the teeth the government should be investing in the very people who have effectively delivered the new deal employment programme and allow them to continue reaching out to the longterm unemployed kate green chief executive of the child poverty action group said any reforms should be based on improved levels of support not greater threats increasing sanctions frightens vulnerable families and makes them likely to see welfaretowork as a threat not a support she said paul farmer chief executive of mind the mental health charity said we would welcome any moves to give people access to greater support in the workplace as they start in new jobs this would help lower the number of repeat claimants who work for a while and then soon become unwell again but he added the risk of compulsion is that people are forced or scared into jobs for which they arent ready people must feel confident that welfare staff appreciate their circumstances to give them a sense of security and allow the system to work the work and pensions secretary john hutton yesterday said the status quo is not defensible mr hutton who was himself brought up in a singleparent family reliant on benefits insisted i dont want to cut peoples benefits we are not reducing anyones benefits despite record employment rates during labours years in power some million people remain on unemploymentrelated benefits with longterm jobseekers

just imagine that it was possible to get women and girls together along with hundreds of ngos and representatives of governments to talk about real ways of protecting young women and girls from violence and improving the status of women surely such an event would be of interest so why when governments women and hundreds of ngos do get together to focus on these issues do none of the conventional media pay the slightest attention the st commission on the status of women is currently in session in new york the csw is a united nations body which comes together for an annual two week session to review the worlds progress on the elimination of discrimination against women it brings together women from countries of every faith including islam women from the global south and from the advanced industrial countries and an impressive array of interest groups and organizations who set up a vast ancillary programme of meetings and events where else will you find iraqs first female judge in a room with a woman parliamentarian from the yemen so how many journalists from the worlds mainstream media have applied for accreditation to this global event around according to solana larsen who is writing one of the only blogs from the csw for opendemocracynet in previous years she reports they had to park a trailer outside just to handle the many requests this year a search on google news reveals an empty landscape back in the s it was a big media story beijing for instance was a global media event today millions of women suffer injustices because of their gender are murdered raped and sold because they are women and the mainstream media are ignoring the biggest global forum for such issues during his term as the un secretary general kofi anan repeatedly pointed out that violence against women is perhaps the most pervasive of human rights violations and real progress towards equality development and peace cannot be made without gender equality it is now widely acknowledged that womens empowerment is crucial to eradicate persistent global poverty the csw is not just a talking shop it was this forum that secured the legal foundations of gender equality and pressured the un into adopting a resolution that affirmed that women and girls also had human rights it gave their legal status recognition and protection now these gains are under attack all over the world according to the commission as many as million girls are shut out of formal schooling millions of schoolaged girls work in domestic service and an estimated percent of child soldiers are girls of young people aged living with hivaids worldwide more than percent are female access to propagandafree sexual education worldwide is systematically undermined by religious conservative groups and in the uk mothers of young children are more discriminated against than any one else in the workplace there is one group though that is not ignoring the csw one of the bigger presences in new york

discrimination against working mothers highlighted yesterday by a review warning of intolerable levels of inequality in britain can only be tackled by ensuring that fathers too can balance work and family responsibilities campaigners said the final report of the equalities review commissioned by tony blair revealed an array of entrenched inequalities and urged new approaches including positive action though not positive discrimination by employers it pointed to working mothers groups in some ethnic minorities and disabled people as among those most held back by unequal opportunities warning that despite great progress in tackling discrimination in britain in some areas we have stopped the clock in some it is starting to turn backwards women with young children face the greatest employment inequality lone mothers with a child under are less likely to be employed than a man with a partner mothers who have a partner are less likely to be in work than men in relationships trevor phillips who chaired the review said women faced outdated attitudes that mothers were less reliable workers and called on employers to recognise the business case for helping women stay in the workforce after having children more than bn worth of talent was being wasted because of inequalities suffered by working women and disabled people he added yesterday the equal opportunities commission which has long highlighted the discrimination faced by pregnant women and mothers in the workplace stressed that the answer could not lie only in providing more opportunities for women to work flexibly eoc research shows three quarters of people say it should be as easy for men to take time off for caring responsibilities as women the commission chair jenny watson said if we are to make these recommendations fit the future part of the solution must be extending the right to request flexible work to everyone only then can we cope with the social revolution we are living through with far more women at work far more fathers wanting to spend time with their children and far more of us caring for older relatives katherine rake director of the equality campaign group the fawcett society said for gender equality to become a reality greater efforts must be made to support fathers desire to spend more time with their children the flexible working campaign group working families said surveys show more men than women now say they want to work flexibly the report fairness and freedom warns that certain kinds of inequality will remain at intolerable levels unless efforts are

when the government published its year childcare strategy in it promised good quality affordable childcare for all the problem was it didnt have the means to deliver it investment was needed to boost the quality of services and reduce the cost to parents but the extra money was nowhere near sufficient so it comes as no surprise that nurseries are struggling to fill their places at a typical annual cost of for a fulltime place more than in some parts of the southeast many parents are effectively barred from using them and if childcare services are to be among the best quality in the world as the government rightly aspires they are set to become more expensive nurseries need to attract betterqualified and experienced staff at around an hour the average childcare workers pay is hardly a draw you can earn more stacking supermarket shelves so wages need to rise and consequently the cost of providing services will go up with parents struggling to meet todays prices the cost of better quality childcare cannot be met by parents the gap between what services cost and what parents can afford to pay for has to be filled by the public purse as indeed it is in many other countries yet the government continues to avoid addressing the qualitycost conundrum mindful of the fact that the answer is more spending other countries invest many times what we do on childcare the government is understandably frustrated that having more than trebled spending on childcare in the past years the benefits have yet to be felt there have been some genuine improvements and the situation is not as dire as some make out contrary to some newspaper reports there is little evidence that parents are shunning services indeed surveys suggest that demand for childcare is increasing nor are there signs that parents are choosing to stay at home the number of parents going back to work continues to rise the need to use childcare is a reality for most families but the prohibitive cost means that many turn instead to friends or family for help despite the governments noble ambitions we are still a long way from achieving good quality affordable childcare for all who want it parents choices are constrained by what they can afford and nurseries will continue to struggle to fill places as long as the gap between cost and affordable price goes unmet we have yet to see a stepchange in the quality of provision nor really figured out the financial consequences but the answer lies not in abandoning or reversing the strategy in this day and age childcare is an important component of family life its just that we have yet to figure out whether as a nation we are willing to pay for it,2007-04,government published year childcare strategy promised good quality affordable childcare problem wa

a new report from the american association of university women aauw confirms what many gender equity scholars have demonstrated for decades while women are more highlyeducated than men they study different subjects in university and enter different jobs after graduation they must confront more difficulties in workplace negotiation and they face greater burdens when it comes to balancing work and family as a result a pay gap begins as soon as women leave university and widens over time and a substantial pay gap remains even when you compare men and women who work the same number of hours have the same work experience and credentials and have the same marital and parental status in the aauw report some of this is attributed to womens choices but its important that the issue of choice not be overblown our culture tends to emphasize choice and most people embrace this idea no one wants to think they dont have choices its disempowering but research by jerry jacobs has shown that women frequently enter maledominated university majors and occupations only to find them inhospitable and end up leaving in a revolving door pattern the pay gap doesnt just exist because women choose careers in education or social services instead of science they are often actively pushed to make those choices and discouraged from entering science mathematics or technical fields the revolving doors continue to rotate women in and out of maledominated jobs long after graduation this might create the impression that women are making choices to focus more on their families than their jobs but the push factors are there employers and employees are wrong to view it as a simple matter of choice also the report notes that female graduates with the same scientific and technological degrees do not enter the higherpaying jobs in those fields for some of the same reasons this is what many have described as a leaky pipeline in which women obtain jobs in lower proportion than they obtain degrees and then obtain promotions and salary increases in lower proportion than they obtain entrylevel jobs why do women leak out of highpaying fields over time or receive lower wages than men in the same fields salary inequity and blocked promotions are discouraging leading women to find other choices more appealing the gender gap in negotiation is also part of the problem and the aauw report suggests that women need to become tougher negotiators the book women dont ask negotiation and the gender divide clearly outlines the research on this men have more sense of entitlement than women and are more apt to promote themselves while women seek to preserve relationships by acting in selfsacrificing ways when women dont ask the longterm effects of small differences in starting salaries lead to much larger longterm gaps but when women do ask they are not treated the same way as men and employers need to take some of the responsibility here especially if they think that women will not leave or will take a lowball offer more readily than men what can we take away from this report and the dynamic metaphors of leaky pipelines and revolving doors we need interventions at every stage encouragement for girls and women to pursue maledominated fields and highpaying jobs sanctions against those who discourage the recruitment and retention of women in these fields standardization of negotiations and vigilant reviews of salary and promotional inequities and we need to reexamine the context in which women and their employers make choices,2007-04,new report american association

fears that women will take over the world which were often disguised as comedy in the s and s could finally be coming true a report from market analyst datamonitor has found that women now make up of the uks millionaires and this number is increasing by a year the wealth gap between millionaires of both sexes is also closing the report found in the average male millionaire was worth m while their female counterparts were worth m by this had narrowed to m for males and m for females this means that over the past eight years while the wealth of a male millionaire increased by female millionaires worth shot up by part of the reason for the increasing wealth of women is due to a rapid rise in divorce and inheritance payments however the number of female entrepreneurs making money on their own right is also growing fast ruth whitehead a former penniless professional bassoon player set up her own independent financial adviser service ruth whitehead associates in and has a client base made up of women during the years i have been in this job the ability of women to make money hasnt changed but their confidence to do so has significantly increased they are also more willing to take a risk but its usually a very calculated risk and i have seen this turn into some very successful businesses ms whitehead adds that attitudes have also changed in recent years women used to feel as though they shouldnt be seen to be enjoying making money but this is no longer the case they can have the children at home and start a new business as well using their inherent entrepreneurial networking skills but according to datamonitor british banks are lagging behind when it comes to servicing the needs of the increasing number of high networth women author of the report and financial services

america this week is divided by the decision of fresno a californian high school to allow cinthia covarrubias a transgender woman who prefers to dress in baggy shorts has cropped hair and sometimes refers to herself as tony to run for prom king she has no plans to have a sex change but says in her freshman year she just started feeling different now i dont have first hand experience of proms being of english variety but from what i understand its a pretty big deal in the us where the american dream is an existence to strive for girls dress like women and boys like men they pick a mate and date like grownups it must be every transgender persons nightmare let alone for boyboy or girlgirl couples lawyers recommended that covarrubias be entered to the ballot complying with a state law protecting students ability to express their gender identity on campus the gaystraight alliance network believe this to be the first case of a transgender student being in the ballot for prom king or queen it is curious that this should first happen in a state not renowned for its liberalism californian students predictably are divided erich logan complains i like lesbians but they shouldnt be allowed to run for king the response online has been equally controversial one blogger hammer a psychology graduate nonetheless muses i have this odd feeling in my stomach right now and i cant tell if its because i want to laugh or im going to puke in response to the gaystraight alliance networks director carolyn laubs statement we are growing as a society to accept much more diversity in gender expression and thats a positive thing another blogger adds she would have no chance of winning the girlie prom queen election if you catch my drift one year old school student leanne reyes however voiced the opinion of the tolerant minority in evereloquent youthful prose its not like the stereotype where the king has to be a jock and hes there with the cheerleaders anymore we live in a generation now where dudes are chicks and chicks are dudes i feel for covarrubias who has confessed to being nervous about prom night when shell come head to head with six young men also decked in tuxedos in a battle to be prom king to much controversy in a conservative traditional america at one of its most traditional of passingout ceremonies covarrubias will escort a close female friend as

a recent survey by price waterhouse coopers shows a fall in women holding senior management positions at the biggest companies listed on the stock market it blamed the rising cost of childcare and a newfound entrepreneurial streak among women nothing to do with the bosses attitude then in survey after survey the equal opportunities commission has found that at the less wellheeled end of the working pile women working parttime are vastly overqualified for the jobs they doing a tradeoff they are forced to make to allow the flexibility to care for a family next month the house of lords will decide in a discrimination case involving banker andrea madrassy and the japanese bank nomura madrassy has lodged a m claim after being dismissed on return from maternity leave if she wins unlikely the onus will shift in discrimination cases from a woman having to prove she was treated differently to an employer having to show that he or she was not guilty of victimisation in britain both vocabulary and the law militate against many women being able to fulfil their potential at a sacrifice to their own earning power and a waste of training and talent parttime work implies halfcommitted at a conference last year held at a major bank in the city senior male managers all working fulltime and more struggled to come up with a phrase that betterdescribed a situation in which an employer worked less than the workaholic norm managed hours was one suggestion except that it implied that those who clocked in five days a week were unmanaged in todays guardian shirley soskin and kate grussing who set up sapphire partners two years ago a headhunting agency to find senior jobs with flexible hours talk about reduced hours not parttime but that too smacks somehow of not getting value for money and words do matter more important than language is the crassness of british law that works against all minority groups vulnerable to discrimination canada consistently tops the uns league for delivering equality why can it deliver when we cant in a royal commission on the status of women was established which made recommendations most of them subsequently implemented in canadas constitution was repatriated from britain and a charter of rights and freedom added the charter lays down clearly that treating women the same as men formal equality is not acceptable it stipulates a belief in substantive equality thus what matters is not the intention of those who are responsible for discrimination but the effect of their actions the aim of the courts is not punish forcing a bank for fork out m to one individual for instance is peanuts for the bank and does nothing to change attitudes it is to remedy the discrimination for the group to whom that discriminated individual belongs so hypothetically the court could order that all parents are entitled to work a sixhour day if they so chose without fear of paying a career penalty the right to request flexible working is available here but it is the individual who has to ask for it and its not yet clear how high a price they then pay in terms of their future career development the canadian system is clearly not perfect but at least it understands that tackling discrimination isnt about large amounts of money paid out to certain individuals and armies of lawyers while the values and work ethic of the company go unchanged it recognises that some women have babies and any company that behaves as if they dont has to change,2007-04,recent survey price waterhouse cooper show fall woman holding senior

government attempts to encourage women to remain in work and reach toplevel positions have repeatedly failed a recent survey by pricewaterhousecoopers showed a fall in women holding senior management positions at the biggest companies listed on the stock market and blamed the rising costs of childcare and a newfound entrepreneurial streak among women but two businesswomen believe they can make a difference shirley soskin a former public relations adviser and kate grussing a former wall street investment banker and onetime mckinsey management consultant have set up a headhunting agency to find senior roles with flexible hours for bank and corporate executives flexibility and seniority have not traditionally gone together the equal opportunities commission is convinced inflexible traditional working patterns are driving women to set up on their own the governments labour force survey supports this the number of selfemployed women has risen in five years to more than million the gender pay gap is also a problem women working full time receive less than male counterparts while parttimers are paid on average less this month the government outlined yet another new initiative ruth kelly the womens minister announced the creation of a fund to provide grants to companies such as tesco kelloggs and royal mail to encourage the creation of senior parttime management jobs and give women confidence to choose a better worklife balance kelly said this fund is designed to show employers that women can balance climbing the career ladder with their home lives soskins and grussings sapphire partners set up two years ago has about candidates on its books of whom are women their average salary in fulltime work would be at least but grussing says most would accept less money to work flexibly the women both in their s make it clear they do not find jobs with preset hours and fixed goinghome times where this wont work is when people say they want to work ampm so that they can do all the school runs says soskin equally they expect employers not to try to wring out more than they pay for it is flexible working not parttime soskin says it is reduced hours rather than parttime both sides have to work it out it doesnt work where you have oldfashioned employers saying do three days and you choose tuesday wednesday and thursday and they arrange a conference call on a monday half of the candidates they place are in permanent flexiblehours jobs and half are hired for projects their shortest placement was four days a client who needed crisis management consulting we are both full on but work flexibly says grussing a mother of four children under we both take our kids to school every day and we never miss a school play grussing gave up a highly paid job as an investment banker at jp morgan to spend more time with her family soskin who has two children was looking for a new challenge after selling her pr agency to wpp they share the role of managing director but take the lead on areas they know best kate takes a lead on the financial side and i take the lead on corporate clients explains soskin but we know each others main clients and try to cover for each other when necessary their light and airy office in covent garden in central london now has support staff and they recently hired a new recruiter on flexible hours to place candidates in legal jobs they say flexible working can work well for employers too provided they measure output rather than presenteeism people dont bring stuff into the office when they work flexibly says soskin if you allow people to work flexibly they appreciate it and are much more committed they dont try to deal with domestic issues when they are in the office and because they are exposed to other things outside the office they bring in much more creativity you get of someones brain but only pay for of their time but says grussing not everybody can lend themselves to working flexibly we target people who are quite mature status and titles go out of the window in return for flexible hours the toughest jobs on reduced hours are clientfacing roles they have had to convince employers to take on highly qualified people who want to work flexibly particularly those who held senior roles the two women think more men will demand familyfriendly working arrangements we hope that it will become more

polly toynbee neatly put together two highprofile news stories on the same day irans release of the sailors with pictures of leading seaman faye turney and her baby looked after at home by her husband coinciding with new research on the effects of childcare on childrens behaviour the liberation of the sexes from their pink and blue fates has hardly begun april the research referred to is the national evaluation of the governments neighbourhood nursery initiative nni carried out by researchers at oxford university the institute for fiscal studies and the national centre for social research even headlines collided toynbee wrote a gender story about women work and childcare in contrast to other papers headlines of nurseries turning our children into yobs and how nurseries still breed aggression toynbee rightly complains that making the evidence fit the opinion and the leader line is gross distortion of nuanced research by the usual suspects of the antichildcare backlash as she says a modest increase in aggression and anxiety in a small number of children staying in nursery more than hours a week has been presented as if it were a major and inevitable impact for all children in all childcare she might have added our finding that it was children in nurseries with a high proportion of working parents who were more cooperative and less antisocial than children in nurseries with a high proportion of workless families this gives additional support to the governments aim of getting parents into work quality is the crucial ingredient and as she pointed out staterun nurseries came out best here with betterqualified staff and links with childrens centres but nnis real story is about childcare and poverty nni has pumpprimed childcare places in new nurseries expected to be selfsustaining after three years threequarters of them in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the country toynbee notes that the new nurseries have enabled many women to work for the first time helping them and their children to escape childdamaging poverty particularly lone parents and parents with few qualifications who have difficulty in getting jobs our conclusions raise two policy issues the first is how to boost quality across the board to equal the best of the staterun nurseries offering stimulating environments and teachers qualified to work with the youngest children the second is whether nurseries can be really selfsustaining in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods where parents may take longer to develop the skills and selfconfidence needed to move into the job market requiring longer subsidy before nurseries can reach liftoff in a world of increasing numbers of women in the labour market it is crucially important that the poorest families do not get left behind and that the provision they have available is top quality teresa smith is one of the lead researchers working on the neighbourhood nursery initiative evaluation she is based at the

do you want some more cheese says jane cunningham down the phone on a midweek afternoon shes not cajoling me but her oneyearold son who sounds like he is enjoying every last morsel of his lunch cunningham and her partner philippa roberts are among the growing number of women in their s turning their back on successful careers in international companies to set up their own projects it has made sense for me and has been fantastically liberating i still wanted to work fulltime take on the projects i want but also be able to invest myself in a company i believed in she says their womenfocused advertising agency pretty little head specialises in applying gender research to marketing campaigns currently theyre working with the conservative party educating the tories on how to appeal to women according to cunningham and roberts who have worked for bmp ddb and ogilvy amp mather most advertising aimed at women is ineffective advertisers consistently misjudge the feminine psyche which appreciates supportive and altruistic behaviour over more masculine values like selfinterest its not that no man can advertise to or employ women says cunningham its that men and women are motivated by different values but men assume women are the same masculine cultures are ingrained in most organisations which have structures attitudes and behaviour that are quintessentially male these masculine characteristics reckons cunningham can subtly militate against an employers ability to attract and get the most out of women employees just as they can militate against an organisations ability to develop advertising products or services that appeal to women organisations are designed and set up in a way to reward and encourage people who move up the hierarchy but women are often uncomfortable with adopting the kind of behaviour thats needed to get to the top the big turnoffs for women are oneupmanship internal politics and pointscoring all prevalent in most peoples experience of corporate life women tend to be more socially conscious and want to work for employers who represent more utopian views while most employers have addressed the gender equality issue on paper in reality few are attracting or retaining women at core management level figures published by pricewaterhousecoopers pwc suggest that in the past five years there has been a drop in the number of women working at middlemanagement level as things stand there will be fewer not more women reaching board level to successfully employ women argue cunningham and roberts male bosses must demonstrate that ethics and values are at the heart of the organisation most women want to believe in the companies they are working for feel that their opinions are valued and have opportunities to work collaboratively with colleagues its not surprising that women are more likely to flourish in newer smaller companies that have flatter management structures and are less internally competitive there are lots of things which women in the main are brilliant at they tend to be less systematic and linear and have more of an intellectual approach to their job says cunningham so theyre good at adopting new models of thinking these are all skills which are in demand in the age of serviceorientated businesses sarah churchman head of diversity at pwc acknowledges that for many bigger established companies with a management that is resolutely pale male and stale attracting women is a huge challenge we had an issue with our female retention rates she admits so we introduced a womens network familyfriendly policies and a female alumni club so that we can lure former female employees back to us and offer them catchup training these supportive and connective strategies have helped pwc to attract women back to the company and crucially retain women already in post there are also clear gender differences when it comes to how men and women like to be recruited pwc found that women were sceptical about online tests as they believed counterparts would cheat so rendering it worthless when companies are recruiting it is important that contact is made early on and that people are guided through the hiring process says churchman our personality test was seen to alienate women and so we had to respond to that successful employers will she thinks be the ones who adopt more female recruitment methods and modes of working why is it that woman appointed to board is still headline news asks churchman but its going to continue to be the case if people dont understand and respond to whats going on lower down the pecking order companies who cant hang on to women should be very worried in the meantime startup companies and independent ventures are reaping the rewards able to hire highcalibre women on the lookout for more attractive ways of working sophie devonshire is one such woman a former advertising executive for procter amp gamble and cocacola she enjoyed the competitive masculine nature of corporate life but found that it was incompatible with her role as a mother i think its dangerous to say that women are not as ambitious as men because we are but were also ambitious for our families prompted by the birth of her first child sophie established a mailorder gift company babes with babies i dont work any less hard but in corporate life i would have been made to feel guilty if i left the office early this way i work around my child diagnosing the problem is part of the problem says jane cunningham its more of a subtle cultural attitude which needs to change its not that women are unambitious they just dont want to live and breathe their job were motivated by slightly different things and this needs recognition if organisations are to employ women and retain them ten things male bosses dont understand about their women workers women often feel undervalued because historically their work has paid them less and the traditional role as a carer has been undermined women want to invest themselves in a company that has utopian and communityorientated values and for these to be demonstrated practically and publicly women appreciate top up communicative management rather than authoritative top down management it shows shared and reciprocal thinking which creates a sense that we are all valued women dont want to be part of a gang mentality they would rather have more independent status and a flexibility to grow and change women tend to be more intuitive and responsive to coworkers thoughts and feelings whereas men are less likely to recognise personal issues or register them as important aesthetics are important to women as they tend to believe that attractive environments are safer more harmonious and a pleasant place to be in women are more aware of and are keener to anticipate pitfalls and risks women will often internally assume personal responsibility for everything and demonstrate this responsibility by taking on the role of planner believing this off sets risk women tend to diffuse conflict by drawing people together and finding common ground important in fostering successful working relationships and communities women often search for new answers as they are less linear and systematic in their thinking they will often employ a whole brain approach to problemsolving which uses emotional intellectual and practical experiences,2007-04,want cheese say jane cunningham phone midweek afternoon shes cajoling oneyearold son sound like enjoying every last morsel lunch cunningham partner

the report on the neighbourhood nurseries initiative has provoked a surprising degree of hysteria with some elements of the press painting a picture of a generation of feral footstamping toddlers emerging from the nations childcare settings but what the report actually shows is that the government programme has been a great success around half of the parents who sent their children to neighbourhood nurseries had never used formal childcare before and among them were parents from some of the most disadvantaged groups in society this is great news for the governments national childcare strategy because to date these are the groups which have shown much slower takeup of childcare and who live in areas where childcare is at its scarcest the report also found that the quality of care in neighbourhood nurseries was pretty good and this is an area the government is working on the finding that long hours of group care affects childrens behaviour is not new and echoes earlier findings the effect on a small minority is described only as significant but modest a far cry from nurseries are turning our children into yobs as one tabloid newspaper shrieked from its front page on wednesday towards the end of the tenyear national childcare strategy we would expect to see a picture of muchimproved childcare in the uk at the moment research will still be picking up on the fact that weve started from a very low base with almost no publiclyfunded childcare and one of the worst records in europe but we need to be ambitious and follow the nordic countries where nurseries provide the best mixture of care and learning where childcare environments are led by properlyqualified teachers the outcomes for children are excellent especially for disadvantaged children and this is the age to start if we want to drive up educational achievement and prevent future poverty we cant hope to end child poverty unless we have a national childcare infrastructure to match the best in europe parents will not have the confidence to move into employment unless they are sure of the quality of their childrens care the absence of childcare in this country has for too long been a brake on the ambitions of women especially lone mothers who have therefore been locked out of the labour market no one is suggesting walltowall dawntilldusk childcare strengthening worklife balance will be of the essence so mothers and fathers can spend more time with their children particularly in the early years the government has made a good start but there is still more to do to establish a combination of leave and pay that offers parents real choices it is hard to understand the desire in some quarters to lambast the national childcare strategy and write off this ambitious tenyear plan only two years down the line who would want to torpedo it at this stage i can only think its those who want parents to return to the home in droves but the genie is already out of the bottle most

madeleine bunting is right to say that the subject of childcare has become emotionally inflamed and there is no need for panic responses nursery may be harming your child but dont panic april but she is wrong to say the evidence rules out the importance of quality of parenting us researchers say parenting is the most important factor of all the reporting of the neighbourhood nurseries evaluation in the press this week was also misleading again the effects on childrens behaviour were modest yet what this report highlighted was the importance of quality the best being in the maintained sector and childrens centres the real news that nurseries are reaching some of the most disadvantaged groups many of whom are working and using childcare for the first time seems to have passed people by towards the end of the years covered by the national childcare strategy we would expect to see a picture of muchimproved childcare in the uk at the moment research will still be picking up on the fact that we started from a very low base with almost no publicly funded childcare and one of the worst records in europe we need to be looking at the nordic countries where nurseries provide the best mixture of care and learning when you have childcare environments led by properly qualified teachers the outcomes for children are excellent especially for disadvantaged children the benefits of good earlyyears care and the help it offers to lift them out of poverty cannot be underestimated madeleine was right to call for a truce in the daycare wars which are being used as a stick to hit some of the poorest women with alison garnham joint chief executive daycare trust all three of my children spent several years attending a day nursery full time five days a week far from harming them i felt it was an overwhelmingly positive experience they had a fantastic social life learnt to share and deal with both positive and negative behaviours from other children and were encouraged to have an enthusiastic approach to learning have fun and to be uninhibited about trying new things and making mistakes i can well believe such children turn out to be a little more disruptive than average in a classroom however in this competitive and hostile world a little exuberance and even aggression will ultimately stand children in good stead helen gough cheltenham excellent articles on child poverty from polly toynbee the public worry more about spanish donkeys than child poverty march and larry elliott only the rich can end child poverty april proposing that its time for the rich to finally spare a few coppers for the courageous and mad project of ending child poverty yet there is one element that is worryingly absent from their analyses and which the chancellor needs to think about urgently the link between the facts that more than half the children in poverty now have parents in employment that over twothirds of working lone parents face a marginal tax rate in excess of and some over and that pouring more money into tax credits deepens rather than relieves the poverty trap once youre in work if work is the solution to poverty and a third of lone parents leaving income support return to it after two years we are missing something if we dont spot a major disincentive the only means test that doesnt involve the poverty trap is the tax system it is crazy that in spite of the name tax credit people are still paying tax and receiving benefits or credits its a pity it was beyond human wit to integrate the two we need to combine the engagement of the richest in this great project with increasing tax allowances taking people out of tax in such a way that the richest dont benefit currently some of the working poor are paying for their own tax credits to some extent unfortunately this being britain it will also create a poverty trap costshunt increase net income and people lose housing benefit just as happens with tax credit since that is counted as income for housing benefit so push up tax allowances further with the money we save take more people out of benefits and make sure the rich dont benefit steve griffiths london,2007-04,madeleine bunting right say

its become conventional wisdom that the first three years of life are the most important in a childs development parents eagerly gobble up educational infant toys and dvds such as baby prodigy which claims to help parents build a smarter happier baby or brainy baby which claims its products will turn your infant into a little genius in the making one of these products the baby einstein line of infant dvds even got a shoutout in president george bushs state of the union address meanwhile many politicians in england and the united states swayed by arguments about the importance of the first three years have sought to boost investment in programs such as the uk governments sure start program which provides early education and care for children in deprived communities all of these promise to produce longterm social benefits by improving early childhood brain development but like a lot of conventional wisdom the truth is secondary and those who advocate the overriding importance of the first three years get some of the facts wrong as i argue in a recent paper published by the think tank education sector hype about the importance of the first three years often extends far beyond what existing scientific knowledge about the brain actually justifies neural connections in babies brains grow rapidly in the early years and theres plenty of scientific evidence to show that children and animals deprived of stimulation early in life suffer lasting intellectual and emotional damage but theres no evidence to support the converse notion that extra stimulation above and beyond what nurturing parents naturally provide by talking to cuddling and playing with their infants will have any added benefit or raise childrens intelligence adults cant make newborns smarter or more successful just by having them listen to beethoven or play with einsteininspired blocks some might ask so what increased attention to early childhood development has often been positive for children and their families parents are encouraged to spend more time talking and bonding with their young children and policymakers to increase public support for young children but when child advocates and journalists go beyond what science actually tells us about early childhood development the conclusions they reach can have serious negative consequences hype about the importance of early childhood has caused tremendous anxiety for parents who have been told that their actions during their childrens first three years hardwire developing brains and forever set their childrens intellectual potential parents are naturally anxious about their childrens welfare and futures but now theres a new threat hanging over their heads pick the wrong daycare or pass on the latest baby einstein dvd and you can kiss university goodbye no wonder socalled educational toys for infants and toddlers a market that barely existed a generation ago are now a multibillion dollar industry more importantly the focus on the first three years of life can cause people to ignore all the rest neuroscience evidence refutes the idea that the earliest years are a singular window for mental growth that slams shut once children turn three yet some policymakers have concluded that the importance of early childhood means that its useless to try to improve primary and secondary schools or help older children who have fallen behind after all if children are cooked by the age of three why should we devote resources to trying to help struggling teenagers but existing evidence actually shows that quality intervention programs can be effective in improving outcomes for older children and atrisk youth simply focusing on children before the age of three moreover doesnt mean a programme will deliver better longterm outcomes nor does the popularity of programs for young children mean that they cant be improved these are important considerations in light of the somewhat disappointing results of early sure start evaluations no one denies that the early years are a time of incredible growth and promise but evidence shows that the story is hardly over when children turn three policymakers must take a balanced approach to better support children so they can achieve their potential in the early years and through the lifecycle,2007-04,become conventional wisdom first three year life important

dropping baby off at nursery has become a standard part of british family life in the past decade it is now the most popular form of nonparental childcare in this country providing almost double the number of places offered by childminders it is estimated that in england more than children up to the age of four are in groupbased care for at least some of the time thats nearly a third of the age group but over almost exactly the same period several studies in different countries into the adverse and longterm impact of groupbased care on children have reached strikingly similar conclusions they make uncomfortable reading for parents now its happened again in the us the latest tranche of the worlds biggest study into the impact of childcare on subsequent development finds that children who have been in group care such as nurseries in their preschool years are more likely to be aggressive and disruptive once they reach school and that this persists to the age of what is most disturbing about this new research is how enduring these negative effects are proving to be the more time over hours a week children spend in group care the more likely teachers are to report that their behaviour is more difficult at school even good quality group care has the same impact the effect is small but significant and the research teams concern is not that individuals become axe murderers or rapists but to discover the cumulative effect of millions of children being slightly more difficult among the big and really difficult questions is what contribution is wider use of group care making to other social problems such as teachers claims of a deterioration in classroom behaviour or recent reports of an increase in bullying equally troubling is whether the wider use of daycare could be influencing the increase in mental illhealth among teenagers on both sides of the atlantic the next tranche of research from the us national institute of child health and human development nichd following the children into high school will show whether the problems lead to a more troubled adolescence all the research in recent years has pointed in the same direction these latest findings from the nichd which has been tracking children since are in line with research commissioned by the uk government which has now followed children from three years to seven years and reached similar conclusions last year child expert penelope leach published research with oxford university indicating that yet again there is something about groupbased care that makes a child more disruptive later other aspects of the nichd study are equally demoralising for advocates of quality nursery care as improving childrens educational achievements by age almost all cognitive and academic advantages of daycare evident in the earlier years at school have levelled out with one exception good quality daycare is linked to a bigger vocabulary at years intriguingly the negative effects of other forms of nonparental childcare perceived at earlier ages disappear as the child grows older but not those of daycare there is something unique to groupbased childcare but its not about the quality of care the researchers eliminated that possibility nor is it about the quality of parenting it could be the scenario of stressed tired parents picking up children after work but the study ruled out quality of parenting too there are two possible explanations but they need more research first there could be something about the dynamics of peer pressure among small children a kind of push and grab competitiveness which if not handled correctly leads to a higher incidence of aggression throughout childhood another possibility is that groupbased care is inherently stressful and childrens cortisol levels are raised theres no need for panic responses there are clearly tradeoffs to be made in any circumstances the benefit a child may experience from no longer living in poverty if his or her single mother is in work may outweigh any risks of groupbased care its time for a truce in the intermittent socalled daycare wars which have raged on both sides of the atlantic for more than years so we can clarify what to do rather than the research being used as a stick to beat women with for example are there ways to mitigate the negative impacts better staffchildren ratios and smaller groups of children perhaps are there ways to increase the provision of nongroupbased care such as childminders cant we increase the ability of parents to afford to take more time off work to share the care in the earliest years this subject is emotionally inflamed it tugs at the heartstrings of even the most confident parent and the research has frequently been hijacked for example to get at working mothers up to now the government has argued that improving quality of group care would be enough to counter the research that is no longer tenable after all the angst stirred up by unicefs

poor pay in femaledominated caring jobs is undermining public services with women expected to work more for love than money pocket money wages in professions such as childminding and caring for the sick or elderly have led to high levels of staff turnover which risks dragging down the standard of service according to a report by the equal opportunities commission eoc the commission said that turnover in early years daycare stands at while in residential care for older people it had risen to eoc chairwoman jenny watson said it is time for us all to challenge our outdated perceptions of femaledominated roles it is shocking that we still expect women who work in caring roles to work more for love than money the report claimed that work traditionally done by women was undervalued in part because of the stereotypical view that women were naturally good at caring roles although it is illegal to pay women less for doing the same job or work of equal value there is still a gender pay gap in fulltime hourly earnings last year the average hourly rate for a childminder was and only for care assistants and home carers that compares with an hour for a car mechanic ms watson said the law makes it clear that women who undertake work of equal value to men should get equal pay but that law hasnt kept up with the way services are delivered today where the contracting out of services means that women work for one employer men for another so we want to see reform of the law to make equal pay a reality for thousands of women on whom our public services depend,2007-05,poor pay femaledominated caring job undermining public service woman expected work love money pocket money wage profession childminding caring sick elderly led high level staff turnover risk dragging standard service according report equal opportunity commission eoc commission said turnover early year daycare stand residential care older people risen eoc chairwoman jenny watson said time u challenge outdated perception femaledominated role shocking still expect woman work caring role work love money report claimed work traditionally done woman wa undervalued part stereotypical view woman naturally good caring role although illegal pay woman less job work equal value still gender pay gap fulltime hourly earnings last year average hourly rate childminder wa care assistant home carers compare hour car mechanic watson said law make clear woman undertake work equal value men get equal pay law hasnt kept way service delivered today contracting service mean woman work one employer men another want see reform law make equal pay reality thousand woman public service depend,"['poor', 'pay', 'femaledominated', 'caring', 'job', 'undermining', 'public', 'service', 'woman', 'expected', 'work', 'love', 'money', 'pocket', 'money', 'wage', 'profession', 'childminding', 'caring', 'sick', 'elderly', 'led', 'high', 'level', 'staff', 'turnover', 'risk', 'dragging', 'standard', 'service', 'according', 'report', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'commission', 'eoc', 'commission', 'said', 'turnover', 'early', 'year', 'daycare', 'stand', 'residential', 'care', 'older', 'people', 'risen', 'eoc', 'chairwoman', 'jenny', 'watson', 'said', 'time', 'u', 'challenge', 'outdated', 'perception', 'femaledominated', 'role', 'shocking', 'still', 'expect', 'woman', 'work', 'caring', 'role', 'work', 'love', 'money', 'report', 'claimed', 'work', 'traditionally', 'done', 'woman', 'wa', 'undervalued', 'part', 'stereotypical', 'view', 'woman', 'naturally', 'good', 'caring', 'role', 'although', 'illegal', 'pay', 'woman', 'less', 'job', 'work', 'equal', 'value', 'still', 'gender', 'pay', 'gap', 'fulltime', 'hourly', 'earnings', 'last', 'year', 'average', 'hourly', 'rate', 'childminder', 'wa', 'care', 'assistant', 'home', 'carers', 'compare', 'hour', 'car', 'mechanic', 'watson', 'said', 'law', 'make', 'clear', 'woman', 'undertake', 'work', 'equal', 'value', 'men', 'get', 'equal', 'pay', 'law', 'hasnt', 'kept', 'way', 'service', 'delivered', 'today', 'contracting', 'service', 'mean', 'woman', 'work', 'one', 'employer', 'men', 'another', 'want', 'see', 'reform', 'law', 'make', 'equal', 'pay', 'reality', 'thousand', 'woman', 'public', 'service', 'depend']",189
women are unlikely to thrive in organisations where fewer than of the senior executives are not already females according to a study to be published today the researchers at the london business school argue that there is merit in introducing targets to ensure the progress of women up the managerial ladder after finding that companies with female chief executives were more likely to enlist women in crucial projects this suggests that executives must take cognition of the fact that when the proportion of women in senior positions is less than critical mass generally considered to be then the culture and the practices of the organisation are unlikely to create a strong pipeline for women the authors from the lbs centre for women in business said the researchers led by professor lynda gratton conclude we recommend that executives address this issue of the tipping point as a matter of urgency they also recommend that companies address the gender imbalance by requiring headhunters to field female candidates and that half of all executive selection panels are women the study is based on the practices of organisations in european countries ranging from car companies to utilities it recommends that executives at the top of organisations create initiatives to foster the promotion of women it also suggests that management teams should build and open the leadership experience pipeline to prepare women for senior roles this will involve for example ensuring access to internal and external networks as well as internal training and development the researchers said their study also calls for women to be exposed to crucial leadership development activities so companies have a continuous focus on leadership development for women the research identifies what it describes as four waves of intervention the first is measurement and reporting of gender diversity such as recruitment and salary differences which then become the basis for targets in some organisations the second is to enable women to be wives mothers and carers with of companies offering flexible working options but nearly half of the companies admitting that fewer than of women managers work flexibly the third is about creating supportive networks that help to mentor and coach women the final wave is about preparing women to be leaders leadership research over the last decade has shown that those who get the top of the organisations typically have experience in leading business critical projects the researchers said but during their research they found that women had a very low participation in any leadership activities they point to one company volvo where this was not the case the car company asked a femaleonly team to design and build a car that would appeal to women,2007-05,woman

thousands of pupils are suffering from unprecedented levels of exam stress according to experts dealing with the fallout from the uks testing culture unprecedented numbers of psychologists are now having to help pupils deal with the emotional strain which can lead to sleepless nights eating disorders and other illnesses nurses at hundreds of schools in southeast england are being trained to pinpoint the symptoms of stress that build to a peak during the exam period the scheme being launched as more than a million teenagers embark on their gcses as and alevels and primary schools complete their standard assessment tests will be rolled out nationally there is now a constant process of revision and examination and lots of students do not cope said vivian hill an educational psychologist at the institute of education these are the most tested children in the world hill who runs training sessions on how to reduce anxiety has seen children with pushy parents and those in failing schools fall physically ill from stress she blamed in part the two years following gcses that were once free of exams as students worked towards their alevels now they are crammed full of as levels and the extra revision they bring meanwhile placebe a charity offering emotional support to primary school children has seen a massive increase in the numbers of pupils approaching counsellors about exams the charity runs a project called placetalk in schools where children can post requests to see a counsellor into postboxes placed in the school buildings so far per cent of the children in the schools have asked for support sheridan whitfield a manager for the charity in london said children from the age of five were able to place requests for a chat into postboxes placed in the school children are accessing it more for exam worries the relentless pressure means psychologists are being called into schools at an increasing rate according to hill we are doing this in a way that we were not doing it five years ago she said senior colleagues now visited schools on a weekly basis working with children teachers and parents in one case we had a father who wanted to send his child to a psychologist because they were at the bottom of the a band and not the top what makes someone behave so unreasonably earlier this month teachers claimed that children as young as nine were becoming disillusioned with school because of the pressure to pass tests a report by the association of teachers and lecturers said that league tables were pushing schools to drop interesting lessons in favour of drilling pupils for exams with a spoonfeeding approach ken boston chief executive of the qualifications and curriculum authority has said children are overtested while the powerful allparty education select committee is about to launch a major inquiry into the issue experts at the institute of psychiatry iop and the mental health charity rethink are so concerned about rising levels of stress they have launched the southeast england pilot scheme to train nurses to help anxious pupils starting with hundreds of schools in south london the project is being funded by the health foundation we ought to be thinking about stress at this time of year said andre tylee professor of primary care mental health at the iop constant assessment does cause stress in a significant minority and this will be a key part of what we do to help schools exam time must be treated as high risk by headteachers according to tylee whose work will help nurses recognise early signs of anxiety and pick up where a pupil may feel suicidal they may know when someone is stressed but what about when that tips into depression or mental health problems he said the fact that psychologists are starting to take stress in schools seriously was welcomed by students exam stress always comes up as the top issue said rajeeb dey founder of the english secondary students association schools bringing in educational psychologists is a wise move different types of sessions are running in schools up and down the country staff at the institute of education have helped set up a stressbusting session at burntwood school a large comprehensive in south london that caters for pupils aged to mary holden head of learning support at the school now runs sessions for individuals or small groups where she teaches them how to calm down through breathing techniques among others if someone becomes stressed we give them more attention said holden if someone is incredibly anxious and it is affecting their performance then we may put them somewhere separate to take the exam last week linda blair a clinical psychologist who focuses on stress issues gave a talk to as and alevel students about how to keep calm and do their best in exams as well as offering advice on how to manage their time she gave tips on how to eat sleep and exercise students were advised to eat proteins when revising and carbohydrates when winding down caffeine was to be avoided for those suffering sleepless nights she advised power naps in the day using an alarm clock out of reach to wake them up a minute power nap is worth one sleep cycle at night or one and a half hours she said where she was able to talk to students six weeks before exams she recommended regular aerobics elsewhere headteachers have turned to alternative techniques such as massage to help pupils cope at a school in staffordshire holistic therapist and former teacher frances latham uses breathing and visualisations to help stop panic attacks there are also private options for parents who are particularly worried about their children tim francis a chartered educational psychologist works with pupils in the most extreme cases where they completely freeze during the exams he also offers advice over the internet that suggests students tense and relax muscles up and down their entire body such techniques were once shunned by schools but headteachers are increasingly turning to them it is becoming more common for young people and parents to report unpleasant effects at this time because they are concerned about examinations said martin ward deputy general secretary of the association of school and college leaders it is not just gcses the key stage two and three sats are impacting on younger children who are less able to cope with the pressure graham taylor the former vicar who is now the bestselling author of the childrens book shadowmancer said children were terrified by the number of exams they faced my daughter is eight years old he said she is year three at a school she has taken two days off sick this week for the stress of two weeks of exams taylor who visited schools last year to give motivational talks blamed an obsession with testing the education system is in crisis he added the answer was not better exams but happier children for some parents the pressures are far too high hazel hallows a motherofthree from manchester said that children had enough additional worries about fitting in they have got enough to worry about she said and then on top of that is whether they get the grades for college but while

the announcement of a governmentfunded scheme to teach parents how to talk to their toddlers might well be a parody of new labour initiatives its not i can a childrens communication charity has come up with a speech development programme which will eventually be rolled out across the governments sure start centres the aim of the scheme is to teach parents and carers how to enhance their childrens speaking with a set of guidelines as well as to spot infants with communication disabilities according to i cans research half of all children start primary school unable to speak as well as they should do identifying which children are not developing their language sufficiently in order to identify some of the underlying factors would seem to be an important part of remedying the problem but somewhat typically of governmentadopted schemes i can hasnt really examined causes skipping on instead to a questionable solution we will never know therefore whether there is a relationship for example between slower speech development and spending all day alone with a laconic parent or whether the problem is too many children in a nursery or whether its those french au pairs who are the culprits or whether its pure unadulterated neglect although i can doesnt give us any answers their head of early years clare geldard has suggested that television and videos may be problematic her explanation for this is not the one that immediately leaps to mind tv as a mute and at times inappropriate babysitter but rather that television doesnt respond well to children causes aside will i cans early talk programme really be a solution the scheme will equip parents and childminders with what theyve apparently never had before the basic skills they need to develop childrens speech that large numbers of parents dont know how to get their children speaking however sounds as credible as parents being under the illusion that television responds well to children a decline in infants speech abilities is much more likely to be down to the simpler fact that parents arent talking to them enough all sorts of parents a few parents who dump their children in front of the tv instead of engaging with them but also caring parents time poverty is a big problem for many families and doubtless the strain doesnt help childrens language development not just trying to have it all but the huge economic pressures many parents face make for very difficult workchildcare balancing acts skyhigh mortgages alone are compelling parents to work more hours than they want sometimes even more jobs children ask questions and theres no time to answer them theres less time to read aloud to your child let alone time to discuss the plot with them there are also bound to be issues with some formal childcare i can will be ensuring that nursery staff are trained to get children to talk but this isnt going to remedy a situation where access to highquality childcare is very limited and more people are using nurseries than ever before betterpaid and betterqualified nursery staff would have more impact on speech development than any speech scheme something that concerns i can is that parents think school will sort out any language deficiencies in light of jampacked school life today their worry is warranted adults in school have no time for talk either i can goes so far as to connect initial poor communication skills to later neethood to yearolds not in education employment or training yet although i can recognises homelife deficits in language development it hasnt recognised the speech impediments in the classroom that are contributing to inarticulacy and alienation while talking reading and being read aloud to at home are fundamental building blocks of good language skills given the right environment teachers should be able to build on these yet in school days so tightly regulated and classes so large really interacting with pupils has become very difficult in classes of plus no wonder that i can worries about inarticulate children being unnoticed and left behind furthermore academics have found that the need to cover the ground in the primary curriculum is actively hampering thinking and speaking development like the governments recently announced behaviour programme in schools this governmentadopted early talk scheme is exasperating in many ways it fails to identify the causes of the problem it will doubtless be rolled out with little regard for context and it will mean yet more diktat for educators to incorporate into their already overstretched days most frustrating however is the way that these overly superficial schemes repeatedly fail to identify where government policy itself is directly creating problems in

this week i will be chairing a distinguished panel of judges honouring some of britains leading female scientists and helping to raise the profile of the distinct challenges facing women in science it will be a celebration of the best from the likes of sarah hodge who has been in the kalahari investigating how meerkats behave and cooperate to theresa burt de perera who seems to be overturning the idea that fish cant learn and these are only two of the eight fantastic women shortlisted this year i have a nagging question though why arent there more such women sadly women in their late twenties feel that they face a stark choice children or career this choice is particularly uncompromising in the sciences as is the outcome a huge dropout rate missed opportunities and untapped potential scientists on the whole dont achieve a secure position until their mids which for women is beyond their ideal time for starting a family if a woman leaves to have a baby it is very hard for her to return to a position comparable to those who have not taken time off and who have been publishing papers the coinage of a significant career in her absence research science is different to most other careers in that there is no clear structure if you dont publish papers you are unlikely to get a grant the result is that women drop out and cannot necessarily return to pursue their careers in the sciences at a level commensurate with their abilities this is not an issue that will simply go away or solve itself in this country it is estimated that up to female scientists with science engineering and technology qualifications leave their jobs and do not return to pick up and pursue their careers in the physical sciences there are per cent men and per cent women across the board in biological sciences there are about the same number of men and women in the beginning but around their late s to early s women begin to drop out to the extent that by the stage of professor the rate is just as bad for the physical sciences the main reason for departure is maternity leave the main reason for not returning is the disincentive of a lack of structural support both financial and social this feeds into a range of issues commercial social cultural and political if women and women from ethnic minorities in particular are underrepresented what can we do to address it this was the subject of the research for my report on women in science for the department of trade and industry in which was notably commissioned by the first female secretary of state for the dti patricia hewitt now more than ever we are entering an era where science and technology are at the centre of society and we need the best people as scientists we need the brightest to tackle some of the biggest problems that face society not least pressing being environmental and medical challenges it is crazy to eliminate per cent of talent it is also crazy to invest in educating and training people and then ignore them and their expertise in later life there still seems to be a lack of recognition in commercial and political circles this scenario may in part be linked to a nervousness about highlighting a problem they dont know how to solve if not it points to a more deeprooted issue of ignorance or indifference the challenge facing all leaders not least gordon brown and his new ministerial team is how best to accommodate women so that they can have children without compromising their careers and the future of science to see tangible progress we need to make progress at a macro and micro level we need to address cultural issues about the role of women in society i would like to see a global dialogue around the world to discuss collectively the issues that hold us back from full participation in the science and technology sphere in particular issues surrounding childcare women from all societies have children and some societies from whom we can learn seem better equipped at supporting mothers meanwhile in the uk there must be a renewed and sustained effort to address any discriminatory attitudes the underrepresentation of women in research activities can be traced back to education systems particularly at the higher levels building a greater emphasis towards the sciences in our education system is important as is ensuring a more accessible syllabus and an end to prejudices about male and female courses in our schools it is very important that we end any misconceptions about certain courses being for certain sexes and attract greater numbers entering the sciences at postgraduate level at a microlevel we need to encourage greater tolerance and flexibility in the workplace and formalise privatepublic partnerships to fund schemes that award money to women who have children fellowships should be created specifically for those who are primarily responsible for childcare those involved with the loreal fellowships for women in science hope that the prestige and money that accompany these awards should provide a platform to enable very talented female scientists to continue their careers the foresight and finances of loreal and its partners the uk national commission for unesco the royal institution and the uk resource centre for women in science engineering and technology provide fellowships for a few talented female scientists this needs to be replicated so many more women are able to choose both motherhood and science in the st century it is not acceptable for women to feel career and children are mutually exclusive or that they are jeopardising one if they pursue the other but what is abundantly clear is that for too many women the notion of a career break is a cruel misnomer and if it does apply to some they are the few not the many this is a government that has built a reputation of working to secure life chances and a quality of life of benefit to the many not the few now the new prime minister has a chance to make that a

one man in has gone parttime in order to do more childcare one in three has refused overtime and one in a pay rise in order to play a greater part in the raising of his children this data is from a survey of men conducted by the savings bank ing direct you couldnt call it exhaustive but it enters a rather crowded field of conflicting information in the university of east anglia produced a study taken up with wellmeant alacrity by the equal opportunities commission that said fathers wanted to be more helpful with childcare but couldnt get the workplace flexibility and besides that had lower expectations of workplace practices and were less forceful in the way they took advantage of the measures that were in place this was countered in by a bristol university study concluding that fathers didnt take advantage of workplace flexibility because they didnt want to work fewer hours esther dermott who led the research said their priority was being able to control their working hours rather than reduce them dermotts research is closer to the standard line that fathers work harder following the birth of children which is put down to the fact that they take their role as breadwinner more seriously or just cant stand all the blinking noise because intention is such a murky area this is open season for people pushing social agendas a conservative will conclude that men arent affected in the same way by parenthood and should be left to do their jobs rather than being badgered into taking time off they dont really want breast pads dont pay for themselves you know a social radical might conclude that cultural stereotyping is all wrong men are actually more passive in the workplace and women are the true pioneers if we want equal parenting we need to school men somehow in the business of fighting for their rights an oldschool feminist would bemoan useless men who pretend to be off earning a crust but in reality are just trying to get away from the pram in the hall and the closing down of possibilities it connotes a newschool feminist would say follow the money whenever there is a debate containing the keywords family childcare and parenting the first thing everyone does is to get bogged down in gender essentialism men are worker ants women are nurturers women can breastfeed men spill things men earn money women are patient none of this is true oh the breastfeeding is true but its not worth getting hung up about given that its six months of an year process in the main there is much more distinction within genders than between them some men are nurturers and some women are unholy hellbeasts who would do the family more good working than being anywhere near it etc this is reflected within families where people arent trying to draw social curves but simply trying to make things work the greater earner tends to do more hours and the lesser more childcare in time as the pay gap has been addressed this has been reflected in mens increasing role in childcare ill bet my metaphorical farm that once the pay gap closes so will the childcare gap there is nothing that makes worklife balance a womens issue any more than deciding when to have children is a womens issue the only way to proceed in workplace legislation and government benefits is to unsex the issue offer equal flexibility to all parents or if youre a fat cat rip off all parents equally for their failure always to put work first its wonderful news for all of us if men are losing out on wages by making childcare a priority in the short term anyway the fastest way to workable childcare

debates about work and gender equality often conclude that the big battles have been won surely years of legislation and countless work initiatives have put women on a level playing field in the workplace the uncomfortable truth is that stubborn segregation and low pay still persists and one particular section of society is feeling the strain while women entering professions through higher education have made great gains in recent years disadvantaged young women are yet to reap the rewards of the commitment to equal pay for equal work gender segregation in learning at work and apprenticeships remains a real problem as our research for demos latest report mind the gap the women that policy forgot reveals the implications for a young womans pay packet are stark many who start working life as apprentices earn three quarters less than their male peers last week the ywca launched a campaign more than one rung calling for equal pay in apprenticeships this is a necessary place to start if we are to ensure that young women are not financially penalised for their career choices of low paid workers in the uk are women and they still find themselves crowded into the five cs of the economy employed as a caterer carer cleaner cashier or clerical assistant the personal cost of low pay and lack of career progression is undisputed but there is also a high economic cost the women and work commission has estimated pdf that tackling job segregation and increasing womens participation in the labour market could be worth between bn and bn to the uk economy it is also an important time to reconsider our approach to gender discrimination policy the government has just introduced the gender equality duty signalling a continuing commitment to this issue it also marks a welcome shift in emphasis from the elimination of sexual discrimination to the active promotion of gender equality by all public authorities but more is needed if we are to tackle the problem at its root in the past women have too often been treated as a homogenous group with little understanding of the way in which race and class interrelate with gender to compound disadvantage if it is women who make up the majority of those in poverty then policy which concentrates on gender issues alone will do very little to assist them alongside the macrolevel interventions we also need to find ways to address the more human dimension to the problem every young womans career decisions are shaped by daytoday interactions with teachers parents and career advisers giving policy the teeth to change behaviour at this level could have a direct impact on aspirations but in the drive to raise aspirations we have to be careful not to devalue the work done in the caring and service industries these are important roles and anyone doing them is entitled to good pay good conditions and above all respect politicians from all sides of the political spectrum are looking for new ways to tackle poverty and raise

behind every great woman is a great man the reason for this preamble is new research that says men are pushier when nagging their significant other to up his or her working profile a survey by online recruitment site jobsitecouk finds that of women compared with of men feel pressurised to develop their careers demand more money and respect from employers as a result of this partner pressure of woman have resigned while have ended up just hassled by the extra harassment as if work wasnt stressful enough one in five women have urged their partners to reduce their hours concerned that said partners are unhappy and stressed at work only one in women want their partner to earn more money prompting of men to switch jobs the survey also seems to suggest that uk men need lessons in

the womens economic miracle has passed largely unremarked but increasing numbers of women over the past two decades have contributed more to global economic growth than either new technology or the rapidly industrialising giants of china and india in the s many of us thought working outside the home would be liberating for women freeing them from financial dependence on men and allowing them roles beyond those of wife and mother it hasnt worked out that way womens labour has been bought on the cheap their working hours have become longer and their family commitments have barely diminished yesterdays g special investigation into how employers treat parents highlighted companies offering decent maternity packages but many firms refused to take part and the question remained whether a womans career would survive childbirth the reality for most working women is a near impossible feat of working ever harder there have been new opportunities for some women professions once closed to them such as law have opened up women managers are commonplace though the top boardrooms remain male preserves professional and managerial women have done well out of neoliberalism their salaries allow them to hire domestic help but more women face worsening conditions the supermarket or call centre workers the cooks cleaners and hairdressers all find themselves in lowwage lowstatus jobs with no possibility of paying to have their houses cleaned by someone else even those in professions onceregarded as reasonably highstatus such as teaching nursing or office work have seen that status pushed down with longer hours more regulation and lower pay inequality is not just between men and women but increasingly between top women and those at the lower levels of wages and conditions class divisions between women appear in starker form than they did a generation ago indeed those at the top often rely on the labour of those at the bottom to sustain their lifestyles role models such as cabinet ministers yvette cooper three children or ruth kelly four do not face the problems of most working women they receive salaries of three or four times the average female wage have far longer holidays access to drivers and other benefits estimates have put the cost of employing a nanny at a year even the cost of a fulltime nursery place at a year in london is close to many womens annual wage womens right to work should not mean a family life where partners rarely see each other or their children yet a quarter of all families with dependent children have one parent working nights or evenings many of them because of childcare problems the legislative changes of the s and s helped establish womens legal and financial independence but we have long come up against the limits of the law a more radical social transformation would mean using the countrys wealth much of it now produced by women to create a decent family life a hour week and a national childcare service would be a start it is hard to imagine the major employers conceding such demands every gain that women have made at work has had to be fought for womens lives have undergone a revolution over the past few decades that has seen married women and mothers in particular go from a private family role to a much more social role at work but they havent left the family role behind now they are expected to work

ending child poverty is proving harder than expected and the success of the new deal has seriously stalled the governments latest welfare reform green paper published last week was designed to give welfaretowork a much needed jolt unfortunately the reforms to get more lone parents into work look back to front lone parents of older children will be required to look for jobs and accept offers the government intends to move lone parents off income support and on to job seekers allowance when their youngest child reaches this will increase the complexity of the system but is unlikely to help many into work the introduction of new rules for disabled people means that without changes to the conditions on lone parents benefits a disabled lone parent would be required to do more to get a job than a nondisabled lone parent this is clearly unfair the uk is also at odds with policy across europe where lone parents are expected to train or seek work in return for benefits and where lone parent employment rates are higher it might seem sensible to start by asking more of lone parents of older children but this kind of agebased approach is misguided these parents often face significant and complex barriers to work such as having a disabled child and being out of work a long time introducing blanket conditions will generate much stress for people who already face serious challenges and will stand little chance of helping people get jobs it would be far better to ask every lone parent of a schoolaged child to work and decide on a casebycase basis how to help them this means developing a personalised package of support backed up with the requirement to undertake the steps agreed for every parent the benefits system peter hain has inherited is too complex to be effective a single workingage benefit with one flat rate for all outofwork claimants would make the whole system fairer and more transparent it would prevent people from being lumped into crude categories such as lone parents instead people would be entitled to benefit simply on the grounds of being out of work a package of support would be based on their individual circumstances and capabilities and would come with conditions the evidence shows personalised support is what works in helping people into jobs everyone should be able to develop an action plan with their personal adviser based on specific needs and circumstances in some cases workrelated activity will not be appropriate in the short term and this would be reflected in their action plan action plans would be geared toward securing sustainable employment this would represent a properly personalised approach rather than a piecemeal strategy with a range of rulebased exceptions onetoone personalised support is more expensive than a bog standard approach but additional resources are essential every green paper is touted by the government as promising sweeping improvements this one will need to improve to deliver on child

the governments plans to force lone parents back to work will fail unless more is done to expand childcare outside normal working hours according to a new report lack of available childcare is the main barrier to lone parents working according to research published in the wake of government proposals to make single parents on benefit look for jobs when their youngest child turns seven childcare charity the daycare trust spoke to lone parents across england they found care and activities outside school hours were too expensive too inflexible or nonexistent the report recommends a homebased childcare service suggesting a bank of registered childminders who could look after children in their own homes such a scheme exists in scotland developed by the charity one parent families with funding from the scottish executive daycare trusts joint chief executive emma knights said to support these parents in bringing up their children the government needs to go much further in subsidising and providing childcare and in giving parents rights to flexible familyfriendly working conditions lone parents need to know their children will be happy and well cared for she added that by the time their children were at secondary school a large majority of single parents were at work and there were often good reasons for those who were not a child with a disability or caring responsibilities for elderly parents for example we support the right of every parent including those on benefits to make that choice not to work and are pressing for the government to protect it she said the report listening to lone parents about childcare comes in the wake of government proposals to make single parents on benefit look for work when their youngest child is by falling to the age of seven by the research published yesterday reveals the quality of childcare is a particularly crucial factor to lone parents it also flags up the hardship faced by lone parents who have extra responsibilities caring for an elderly parent or relative researchers spoke to single parents in four focus groups across england they found the lack of appropriate childcare for year olds was a major barrier for parents who wanted to go back to work aoife fitzpatrick daycare trusts research officer said parents spoke of feeling reluctant to leave their children at home alone but in many cases they felt they had no choice other parents felt that childcare places for this older age group were not geared to their needs and interests one lone mother in birmingham said at the age of you cant leave them you shouldnt really be leaving them until theyre so what am i supposed to do do i now accept that i cant work for the next three years the charity wants funding for outofschool childcare to be increased the department for children schools and families is putting an extra m into the extended schools programme but the daycare trust believes more is needed it wants the government to subsidise

woman is born free and lives equal to man in her rights declared olympe de gouges in a touch optimistically in the same year in paris germaine de staampeumlautl helped to write the constitution misogynist napoleon bonaparte hated de staampeumlautl and told a friend of hers that he disliked seeing women meddling in politics the friend replied you are right but in a country where they lose their heads it is natural for them to desire to know the reason exliberal writes in response to madeleine bunting that a lot of inequalities are due to inherent differences between men and women its the word inherent that jars and keeps millions of women horrifically subjugated in the developing world while in the uk its woven itself into a gilded cage that many young women are entering into freely they are economically more liberated than in any other period but culturally trapped by contemporary notions of what it allegedly means to be a modern woman the new little oxford dictionary defines inherent as meaning abiding in as essential quality the truth is that both women and men have long been handicapped by a totally artificial construct the allegedly inherent characteristics of what it means to be male and female for women peeling away the layers of what others believe a woman ought to be has arguably been a lot more complicated than shedding some of the skins of traditional masculinity in the very recent past women were deemed inherently less intelligent than men asexual good only for motherhood and as a hag and a crone past lucy moores excellent liberty the lives and times of six women in revolutionary france records the view of literary women in the government controlled gazette de france a woman distinguished by qualities other than those proper to her sex is contrary to the laws of nature while times have undoubtedly changed still beneath all the rhetoric about equality women are judged by many as inferior products aping men acting contrary to the laws of nature that profound prejudice is what anchors inequality the equal opportunities commission in its death throes has launched a gender agenda campaign the eoc has had some sterling leaders the current head jenny watson and the former head julie mellor among them but in its plus years its been a toothless tiger its claws pulled at birth by useless legislation that made a small enough difference to give the pretence of progress but never enough of a difference to deliver genuine change now the eoc has come up with the calculation that it will take years to close the fulltime pay gap fulltime female employees earn less per hour than men and varying periods of time to close other gaps in health safety who does what at home and flexible working women are more likely to work flexibly young men are more likely to become victims of violent attack women are more likely to see a gp women are more likely to picky up a dustpan and brush rightly the eoc says our lives have been transformed dramatically in the last years and we are living with the consequences of an unfinished social revolution women no longer stay at home and many men have no desire to act the absent father so the eoc is pressing the new commission for equality and human rights to deliver equality for all women and men within years by closing the income gap between men and women giving better support to families modernising public services so they meet men and womens needs providing equal access to justice and safety sharing power equally between men and women the aims are fine but the most important part of the argument is totally missing so wound up have we become in proving that women are as good as men and that in the hierarchy of suffering men at times are more victimised than women that we have failed to address what really matters feminism was never about clearing a space in the unreconstructed male world so women could behave like men nor was it about opening a new window of opportunity to capitalism milking for profit the slogans of womens lib a facelift yes because youre worth it it was about transforming society itself gender equality is a daft and sterile phrase without a notion of

lone parents are back in the spotlight with last weeks government green paper recommending a more stringent regime to encourage them to go back to work and the tories plans announced earlier this month to introduce tax breaks for married couples neither proposal shows much faith in lone parents decisionmaking are tax incentives really needed to encourage people to enter a state of wedded bliss thereby as we are frequently told protecting their children from all ills and if paid work as the government claims is a guaranteed route out of poverty why would a big stick approach be needed these approaches suggest that if only we could get the incentives right wed see fundamental changes in behaviour which currently is governed by some other set of values perhaps driven by a distorted system but this ignores the fact that most lone parents aspirations are precisely for a stable relationship and stable employment lone parents know its easier to bring up a child with two parents as most of them have been married and most go on to bring up their child with another adult the average length of time spent as a lone parent is not years but most lone parents also want a paid job and by the time their children are older more of them have one than do mothers in couples but the factors governing lone parents decisions about when and whether they either marry or take up a job are governed by a set of concerns far wider than a simple case of financial incentives or how much hassle they receive if claiming state benefits putting their children first for many parents means being there when they get home from school a continued lack of flexible working opportunities means that this aspiration can be hard to meet and with evidence showing that one of the worst things for a child is living in a high conflict relationship and of lone parents having experienced domestic violence before separation the decision to separate begins to look less like something that can be influenced by a few pounds a week wider contextual factors also have to be considered poverty not only stems from family breakdown but leads to it and of the children in lone parent families where the parent is working still live in poverty a situation in which the decision to take up an unfulfilling job may appear less clear cut when these factors are taken into account policy levers that may have at first seemed obvious may appear less appealing and a quick look at past evidence shows that indeed they rarely work the married couples tax allowance in existence throughout the s and s did little to stem the rising tide of divorce leading to the political consensus that led first the tories and then labour to downgrade the tax advantages to marriage a raft of policies in america to promote marriage has left it with the highest rates of lone parenthood and teenage pregnancy in the oecd and while supportive measures over the past years have seen huge leaps in the employment rate of lone parents recent pilots of more conditionality within the system have been met with scepticism by both lone parents and the jobcentre plus advisers who work with them lone parents once again find themselves the victims of preconceptions about their choices that simply dont stack up unfortunately when it comes to a group about whom so many prejudices have been allowed to develop hard evidence is rarely

child welfare campaigners yesterday accused peter hain the work and pensions secretary of wielding a big stick to force nearly lone parents into work even though their children may still be of primary school age in a tougher than expected welfare green paper mr hain proposed that by most lone parents will be required to seek work once their youngest child reaches seven the government also proposed that claimants out of work for more than months will have to undertake community work or lose benefit ministers have also accepted in principle a proposal to hire private and voluntary contractors to help the longterm unemployed find work but a detailed scheme has been deferred until the autumn owing to the treasurys refusal to provide any pilot funding the proposals represent the governments response to the welfare review by businessman david freud for the previous work and pensions secretary john hutton mr freud had recommended that lone parents with a youngest child or over should be required to seek work by being transferred from income support to job seekers allowance at present the requirement does not kick in until the child reaches the most lax regime in europe mr hain said he intended to go further than freud by first requiring from october next year that lone parents with a child aged or over seek work and then by place the same requirement on lone parents with children aged seven or over mr hain said that by there would be sufficient pre and afterschool facilities to justify the tougher regime this is about opportunities not big sticks it should mean that by of lone parents on benefit will be forced to seek work by being transferred to the job seekers allowance and have to attend interviews regularly seeking work there are lone parents on income support with children aged seven to lone parents are likely to be given a small payment of a week to help them seek work and will not be required to take a job if it will leave the lone parent worse off than on benefit the requirement to seek work will not apply to lone parents receiving carers allowance for disabled children the conservatives favour lone parents seeking work once a child reaches

hasty the tuc described the proposals as disappointing the child poverty action groups chief executive kate green was furious forcing lone parents to face benefit sanctions when their children are

colette marshall the uk director of save the children what these parents need is more tailored support for affordable and appropriate childcare for example so that they can work sanctions of this kind are not going to get to the root of the problem and are crucially not going to have a significant impact on meeting the target of halving child poverty by we hope the government will listen to a broad range of views during this consultation and will offer targeted support to lone parents as opposed to punishing them chris pond the chief executive of the charity one parent familiesgingerbread given the confused signals on work and parenting in the public debate lone parents could be forgiven for feeling damned if they do and damned if they dont if they work they are accused of neglecting their childrens needs and if they dont of scrounging from the state lone parents want help in getting over the obstacles they face when they are ready to work including far more affordable childcare not

group forcing lone parents to face benefit sanctions when their children are still at primary schools is outrageous by the minimum age will be reduced further to seven taking money away from families that are already poor will worsen poverty for many children and put their health and wellbeing at risk unless employers provide more wellpaid highquality jobs with family friendly hours lone parents

into work is not the answer and will have a negative impact on the most vulnerable although all efforts should be made to help lone parents get back into work it should be a choice based on the best

schoolage child to work and decide on a casebycase basis how to help them do it moving lone parents off income support and on to job seekers allowance is a move towards the idea of a single benefit

the work and pensions secretary peter hain has unveiled new measures designed to put more pressure on lone parents to get a job from october single parents will be required to seek work when their youngest child reaches the age of instead of the current age of from that minimum age will be reduced to seven lone parents would be expected to make an eventual move into the labour market in return for new and more personalised support he said it is one of several measures included in a green paper published for consultation today which targets groups who remain furthest from the labour market with untapped potential as well as lone parents these include longterm claimants ethnic minority groups and yearolds not in education employment or training and innercity pockets of poverty and worklessness in the commons mr hain said there was a need to reignite the jobs crusade that started when labour came to power in mr hain said children of unemployed lone parents were five times more likely to be in poverty than children of lone parents in fulltime jobs he added because we are serious about tackling child poverty we intend that this age will be reduced to seven from october backed up by the local availability of highquality wraparound childcare the issue was raised at prime ministers question time when gordon brown told mps it has always been our intention to get more lone parents into work providing them with the childcare and training facilities that are necessary for them to do so he said the new deal for lone parents provided perhaps a quarter of a million opportunities in addition to what exists at the moment for lone parents and others to get into work chris grayling the conservative work and pensions spokesman supported the move but added there was a distinct sense of deja vu about the statement the governments th announcement in years about getting people off benefits and into work the green paper also features a measure announced in this years budget a jobs pledge designed to get people into the workplace over the next three years firms participating in the scheme known as local employer partnerships will offer guaranteed interviews to applicants on benefit who show they are ready and prepared for work david frost the directorgeneral of the british chambers of commerce warned that pushing people off benefit and back to work could be

how did the guardian womens page become so influential it helped that as the feminist movement of the s and s got under way private eye regularly sneered at the page with male newspaper columnists writing biliously about hairy dungareewearing lentileating manhating guardian wimmin there were reams of articles in the tabloids and rightwing broadsheets back then about why men should now slam doors in womens faces to prove that women couldnt have it both ways not chivalry and equality and that vitriolic backlash proved the making of the womens pages the section raised all the difficult issues battered wives the menopause women prisoners giving birth while chained down it asked why girls were put in pink whats hardwired and whats not why sex was often rubbish for women why men were often rubbish but women had no means of escape why should women always do the housework and why shouldnt they do anything a man could do back before the equal pay act in the unions insisted on lower rates of pay for women doing the same job as men in the same factory back before the sex discrimination act in all kinds of jobs were forbidden to women its hard to recapture the shock and fury that feminism caused but never forget these were and still are revolutionary ideas the very notion that women that mothers can be equal in everything reaches down into the heart of family life and questions everything and there is no denying that feminism caused a soaring divorce rate and an explosion of single motherhood women walked away from bad men bad said if you want equality then i can abandon my family responsibilities and pay no maintenance so it is still an unfinished revolution where womens attitudes changed fast but mens only slightly and society has done too little to accommodate this great eruption the economic system still demands a male wage to bring up a child jobs arent flexible enough and womens pay is too low for mothers alone to be breadwinners the guardian womens page had a huge influence in spreading revolutionary ideas the secret was that it alerted one of the most powerful but usually all too politically dormant forces in the land the womens magazines to what was being written the guardian was the conduit for ideas from the us from rosie boycotts spare rib virago the wages for housework campaign and some dottier ones too suddenly the editors of womans own and woman took up these themes and popularised them for a mass audience i doubt any revolutionary ideas were ever spread as far as fast and as effectively as by those magazines read by women under mens noses glossy magazines became the underground press for women the trouble was men didnt get it didnt read it and didnt understand what was in the air they were startled to find women growing discontented and demanding where were they getting these ideas from sometimes we were startled too there was the woman who wrote a card to jill tweedie the greatest womens page writer sent from a remote caravan park ive done it ive left my violent husband and taken the children and were living in a caravan what should i do now jill was appalled what did she know no one wanting advice would have taken jills own life story as any kind of template but her insights into her own life became the anvil on which she pounded out what she knew of how life was for women in general and it turned out she knew a lot and was funny and wry about it too by the time i started writing a column for the womens pages in the battle lines had been drawn years before starting with mary stott but the perennial question was asked then as now why do you need a womens page isnt it a harem that confines and diminishes women as if the rest of the paper was not really womens domain for journalists it was a problem i was a reporter on the observer covering strikes and industrial relations when out of the blue i was offered the column i suspect nervous male editors and features editors kept trying to find women to edit and work on the pages who were not known for feminist writing although it was a great honour im ashamed to admit that like many others i hesitated before joining although i was always a feminist and never a feminismdenier i worried id be branded a singleissue womens columnist a bit frivolous no longer fit for the mens newsroom would i ever get back to the mainstream lurking somewhere beneath was that old fear of being branded as a braburning harridan well i stayed for years some of the best years of my working life and it changed my view of the world all through those tory years there were fierce battles to be fought i might be on the womens page still if i hadnt unexpectedly been offered a job as social affairs editor at the bbc would i ever have made the jump from guardian womens page to guardian comment page without leaving first the fact that i even ask this question shows that the word women still signifies what it always did other second class not serious not one of the boys that paradoxically is exactly why we still need a womens page the revolution is only half made and sometimes it seems to go backwards who else will

the governments plans for a network of surestart childrens centres in every community may be at risk because of a shortage of trained staff and doubts over local authorities capacity to deliver them mps warned today a report by the public accounts committee raised concerns that extending the network from to centres in england by may spread resources too thinly the committee urged councils to ensure they continue to target efforts at the most disadvantaged children who surestart was initially designed to help once the network is extended beyond the deprived areas where the first centres were established todays report following an investigation by spending watchdog the national audit office nao found that only a third of surestart centres were proactively seeking hardtoreach families who may be most in need of their services it called for centre managers to be given more support particularly in financial management after the nao found that only a third of staff interviewed felt wellqualified to perform their roles the surestart scheme offers help for parents of children under five the centres bring childcare health family support and nursery education together under one roof to help give a good start in life to disadvantaged children but local authorities reached the governments target for centres late and setting up a further by will stretch their capacity further said todays report while the department for education and skills now the department for children schools and families has committed extra funding to train early years professionals and centre leaders there is a risk that this will not be sufficient to meet targets for the development of the network the rapid increase in childrens centres creates a risk that the focus on improving services for disadvantaged families will be lost local authorities should distribute resources so that disadvantaged families continue to be a priority the report said it added there is a risk that the number of people being trained under the departments early years professional scheme will not meet the demand for planned new centres over the next two to three years the committee recommend giving struggling councils more time to find qualified staff before opening new centres conservative families spokeswoman maria miller said that surestart was failing many families ms miller said surestart was designed to meet an admirable goal to help the most disadvantaged children get a better start in life the principles behind surestart remain right but there is now mounting evidence that many surestart centres are unable to turn that goal into reality to really deliver for children surestart has to work better with the health service and voluntary groups both of whom have a strong track record of effective support for families most in need but the childrens minister beverley hughes said the government was making huge investment in early years local authorities have been allocated bn for childrens centres alone we have issued guidance to childrens centres on how to engage the most disadvantaged families and plan their activities and we are developing materials to help childrens centres improve their financial management she said the government has committed extra funds to train people as early years professionals and as centre leaders and introduced a national qualification in childrens

are we incapable of having a proper public debate about marriage and the family does the mention of marriage always have to send everyone scuttling into their welldefended positions from which they lob grenades its all the fault of britains moral collapse from the right or its due to britains levels of poverty and inequality from the left as they did last week in response to iain duncan smiths report breakthrough britain theres going to be no letup this week there will be more on marriage cohabitation and children in a report tomorrow from the childrens societys good childhood inquiry its as if the issue of families has become a scab we cant stop picking at theres a good reason its a subject that generates huge anxiety we can no longer sustain the longterm relationships regarded as so crucial for the wellbeing of children anyone looking forward to the birth of their first child knows as they happily choose their buggy and babygrows that the chance of their relationship if they have one lasting until their child reaches adulthood are roughly and the odds are getting worse every decade family life has now become the most unpredictable of lotteries whether youre paul mccartney or struggling on the minimum wage your choice of partner is the biggest gamble you take the script of settling down has been rewritten as embarking on a lifetime game of snakes and ladders your relationship has survived the first year of your childs birth advance places your partner has an affair go back five the consequences of this instability at the core of most peoples private lives are legion it contributes to depression and illhealth married people are healthier live longer are better off and have better mental health relationship breakdown exacts a sharp financial penalty on women whose incomes drop by on average its links with poor outcomes for children is well established lower educational achievement higher risk of drugtaking unemployment depression and relationship breakdown when they are adults themselves the fewer the models of durable parental relationships the smaller the chances that our grandchildren will experience a lifelong partnership such a thing will become as quaint a notion as saying grace before dinner the relationship breakdown rate has a chill factor those bitter recriminatory bustups act as a powerful deterrent making people nervous of commitment and nervous of having children at all none of this is in dispute everyone sees that relationship breakdown exacts a terrible cost where the disagreement lies is first the causes and second whether the state should or can do anything about it and if so what duncan smiths proposal to stack the tax and benefit system in favour of marriage and against cohabitation was a spectacular red herring the statistic cited everywhere was that one in married couples broke up in the first five years of their first child compared to nearly half of cohabiting couples ergo marriage was a good thing get people to marry and all will be well but go back to the social scientist whose research produced this figure professor kathleen kiernan at york university and she questions such a conclusion her research showed that the better off marry while the poorer tend to cohabit so comparing marriage and cohabitation is not comparing like for like poverty puts stress on relationships its not a marriage certificate that stops the bustup but a healthy bank balance but the left is also guilty of misleading arguments relationship breakdown is not caused simply by poverty and inequality they may contribute as a stress factor but something else is going on too some of the worlds highest separation rates are in scandinavia yet countries such as sweden and denmark are among the most equal and have the lowest rates of poverty other commentators attribute relationship breakdown to increasing working hours and the pressures of employment but most scandinavian working cultures are genuinely family friendly whats also involved is that a set of cultural assumptions about how to conduct longterm relationships and what can be expected of them have gone seriously askew as one thirtysomething father said ruefully after the breakup of his relationship our generation just cant do it the right likes to call this moral breakdown but its more tragic than that often its a kind of lack of emotional capability so what if any is the role of government this is the most puzzling feature of the rights take on this issue while they cry nanny state over the smoking ban or the healthy eating initiatives they purr with pleasure at government pronouncements on that most private of adult relationships yet government pronouncements in favour of marriage are an exercise in irrelevance the rate of bustups has risen steadily every year for a quarter of a century but there is one defensible reason that the state has an interest in the private decisions of a couple and that is the longterm wellbeing of their children put childrens wellbeing first and it reframes the debate firstly the question of marriage or cohabitation becomes irrelevant because international studies show that in countries such as sweden or france there is no difference in childrens outcomes whether their parents cohabit or are married they dont have the uks selfselecting phenomenon of predominantly the poor choosing to cohabit sgolne royal for instance cohabited before her recent separation kiernans work shows that once you control for poverty and maternal depression family structure makes little difference to childrens outcomes secondly it puts at the heart of policy a key issue how do we limit the fallout of relationship breakdown on children studies show that it is the conflict before during and after a bustup that damages the child emotionally here is an area crying out for government investment other countries are light years ahead of us in understanding that its a canute exercise to reverse the breakup trends but what is vital is for the state to develop services to help the thousands of adults and children going through the painful experience every year counselling support services mediation and help with negotiations over children and finances this is what the state could do to ensure the impact of separation on children is attenuated the middle classes can pay for this when they separate the less welloff cant afford it yet it is precisely these areas that have been starved of government funding hit by cuts in legal services and the underfunding of mental health services some of this is buried in duncan smiths report but no one bothered to get that far once theyd been fed the line on marriage perks six weeks ago organisations wrote to gordon brown asking him to set up a crossgovernment body to look at what could be done to support families he is yet to reply but heres hoping hes bold enough to shift the punitive british debate about family

i was horrified to hear conservative policy proposals to give married couples regardless of need additional tax allowances amounting to a week report july how dare they seek to misappropriate hardworking taxpayers money in this way why should a professional woman like me who has worked full time uninterrupted since leaving school paying tax and national insurance and not claiming benefits gained an honours llb by parttime study paying all the fees and brought up my yearold son successfully fund such an outrageous attack on responsible behaviour it is a joke to suggest that the family units in the s and s were more successful due to the benefit of two active parents anyone old enough to remember will know that many men spent their lives at work the pub and the golf course only seeing the children briefly the real reasons for young people getting into trouble today are far more about poverty and exclusion from all the real building blocks of life such as education and career opportunities fiona dent maidenhead berkshire so the tories think the main cause of social breakdown is not enough marriage as one of many happily unmarried couples of long standing with children who seem to have survived the rigours of having an unmarried couple as parents we disagree with this argument the answer to social breakdown is not the institution of marriage poverty is at the heart of social breakdown and getting rid of it is the answer unemployment low pay or illness often deal a very difficult set of cards to families often testing relationships and commitments apart from personal commitment good health good education and enjoyable and wellpaid work are the essential economic factors in social stability jol miskin and karen escott sheffield south yorkshire the medias focus on the proposal in the conservative social justice policy group report to favour married couples obscures the proposals which are of the most significance for millions of disabled people and others these are the cuts in benefits and the increased coercion they will face as a consequence of the introduction of the private sector and charities being paid by results for forcing people back to work while they may dress it up as enabling people we would argue that it is more about saving money and scapegoating than any genuine attempt to help people on benefits what we are witnessing with the welfare reform act the freud review and now the duncan smith report is that all political parties are moving to advocate a usstyle maximum surveillance minimal and privatised welfare system where the individual is blamed for their incapacity we believe that disabled people themselves are the bestplaced people to decide on suitable programmes and workrelated activities to be undertaken at their own pace and at the right time john rogers sheffield welfare action network polly toynbee comment july makes a strong case against a marriage tax bonus a further argument against transferable tax allowances is that they channel money to the earning partner whereas child benefit and child tax credits are paid to the caring parent numerous studies show that money paid to the caring parent usually still the mother is more likely to be spent on the children professor ruth lister loughborough university i am a single gay man who has been a foster parent i know of several samesex couples

against not something that we wish to entrench in future legislation paul patrick burnley lancashire although not a tory i welcome david camerons proposals on strengthening marriage and the family for too long living in sin has been given equal status to marriage the results are there for all to see as a teacher i suffer daily from the culture of disrespect which is the legacy of years of social breakdown no one wishes to be judgmental but it is only by getting back to traditional values that our society can begin to regain selfrespect and moral health down the centuries no one has come up

most parents in britain are struggling to find affordable childcare for the summer break according to a new survey which shows average costs are still rising the national childcare charity daycare trust wants extra funding to subsidise childcare in the summer break now less than a fortnight away as it publishes its annual holiday childcare costs survey the report compiled from responses by the childrens information services cis finds that shortages of places are increasing and that costs are still too high for many parents this years results reveal that more than half of the regional cis say parents have difficulty finding affordable holiday childcare some of the areas where childcare is expensive such as the east midlands and the southwest are lowincome areas daycare trust also wants to publicise the fact that parents who receive tax credits are eligible for help with holiday childcare costs through the childcare element of the working tax credit this year of cis reported a fall in fulltime places available for holiday childcare and over half say that uk parents report a lack of affordable quality childcare during the summer holiday the survey found the average weekly cost in england is the areas with the highest typical weekly costs are the southwest southeast and the east midlands the highest reported cost was a child a week or for the entire break a rise on last years highest weekly cost and approximately higher than this years national average however the survey did show areas of improvement particularly in the capital outer london whose holiday costs have been steadily increasing over the past four years has finally seen a reduction the decrease is significant because it brings outer londons costs very close to the national average it also means that outer london is no longer the most expensive region in the country another glimmer of hope is that the cost of holiday childcare in inner london continued to remain the lowest in england inner londons daily and weekly average costs are both significantly below national averages westminsters daily charge for fulltime holiday childcare is for working parents for nonworking parents emma knights joint chief executive of daycare trust said good holiday childcare is a necessity not a luxury but this survey shows what can be done in areas where the local authority recognises the burden that affording holiday childcare places on parents we want all local authorities to follow the brilliant example being set by some of the most generous and recognise that providing safe stimulating places for children and teenagers to enjoy themselves in the summer holidays is a necessity not a luxury she added good holiday childcare not only provides peace of mind for parents who work it can also inspire

despite the wellworn cradle to grave phrase the welfare state traditionally did little for children until they arrived at the school gate but in the last few years ministers have set about building up services for the youngest and with the sort of energy more often associated with toddlers themselves the first ever preschool curriculum came alongside a change in the law to make nursery places an entitlement and then most ambitious of all there is the mushrooming network of sure start childrens centres which at a cost of billions are set to provide integrated health learning and childcare support in every part of the country such reforms will give every child the best start in life and so extend the ladder of opportunity into even the poorest households or at least that is the theory at first glance yesterdays study from durham university casts doubt on whether it translates into practice across a huge sample of children starting school since the millennium the researchers find no improvement in cognitive abilities and just as importantly no narrowing in the performance gap between deprived children and the rest does it follow that the bn that ministers boast that they have spent on preschooling is taxpayer money down the drain emphatically not for one thing on closer reading the durham results look a little less shocking even the youngest schoolstarters examined were born around a time when sure start itself was in its infancy so few of them have experienced the programmes full effect nor did the analysts have information about what type of childcare or preschooling pupils had undergone previous studies however have shown quality is crucial more definitive judgment on whether sure start works awaits a birkbeck study at the end of the year based on data that is tailormade for the job even then more nebulous goals such as relationship building will remain hard to measure yet american experience suggests that it is through such means that preschool services do most to protect the poorest children from drifting towards a life of crime or worklessness so ministers have solid reasons to hold their nerve but when all the international evidence suggested expanded preschool would boost attainment it is disappointing that this is not yet starting to happen one problem may be that the sheer pace of expansion is adversely affecting standards a risk that ofsted identifies today as it releases figures showing that the proportion of highquality childminders is down supporting children through their early years is the most pressing of social priorities ministers must now ensure that quantity is not achieved at the expense of quality,2007-08,despite wellworn cradle grave phrase welfare state traditionally little child arrived

it should be a cause for celebration a fantastic new job or promotion with loads of responsibility and hopefully recognition attached after years of slogging it out youve finally got the position youve always felt you deserved there is just one problem the job description demands you do the impossible sound familiar if youre a woman or in fact anyone except a white middleaged ablebodied man without childcare responsibilities it may indeed ring a bell crashing through the glass ceiling is one thing surviving the socalled glass cliff where you are promoted to a job where you are likely to fail is quite another according to researchers at the university of exeter who came up with the term women are more likely to be given these risky jobs than men who are also promoted to senior positions in fact according to the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd the problem is wider even than that applying to people who are discriminated against on the basis of age disability religion ethnicity and parental status one reason for this says jayne chace chief marketing officer at software company acision is that because women still find it so hard to get to the top level when they are offered a senior role they will grab the opportunity however difficult the role is for men there is more choice over what positions to take sometimes you are more willing to accept a very risky role because you figure you may not get another opportunity she says as a woman you are thinking i know im good and this might be the only opportunity i have to prove myself not only that says michelle ryan part of the research team at the university of exeter when women do get challenging positions they get less support than their male counterparts and dont get the recognition they deserve if successful women have told us that if they succeed they are given another risky position they become known as firefighters of course men do have to take on difficult positions as well but when women get senior positions the odds of it being a risky one are higher this lack of support for women and minorities is central to the glass cliff phenomenon says adrian lock of management college roffey park institute when someone who is different gets into this kind of senior position they have a number of pressures that dont exist for other people he says these pressures mean they may need a different kind of support a lot of this is around the expectations of other people in the organisation t here will be suspicions of tokenism or people may have unrealistic expectations of them the combined effect means anyone different is unlikely to reach expectations and when they fail any mistake may be blown out of all proportion another factor to take into consideration says lock is that if people are different from most of their colleagues at that senior level they are likely to bring a different style of management to the mix this is good in terms of diversity says lock but it will stand out and will challenge the culture these differences need to be embraced by companies says ismail amla a partner at accenture who says businesses need to have policies to stop people from falling over the glass cliff different support is needed for women and people from ethnic minorities and that extends to very senior positions he says for example the biggest issue facing ethnic minority men in these positions is the ability to engage in the informal decisionmaking network which in a lot of instances is based on old school networks and university networks also a lot of the social events are focused around a drinking culture companies need to find alternative ways to help people in senior positions thrive amla says for example we try to create alternative networks that allow all employees to thrive at a senior level it all sounds a bit terrifying but not everybody agrees that the glass cliff even exists including jo causon director of marketing and corporate affairs at the chartered management institute there is considerable evidence to suggest that women are successfully climbing the career ladder for more than years the chartered management institute has conducted research looking at gender issues in the workplace the findings increasingly show that the socalled glass ceiling is giving way to a boardroom greenhouse effect as uk organisations warm to the idea of women in senior leadership roles but for those who do think it very much exists what can be done one answer says lock is that managers must not be afraid to manage all staff appropriately he cites a study from the late s looking at local authorities with good equal opportunities policies where black staff faced more disciplinary actions than their white colleagues the study found that black workers tended to be either overmanaged or undermanaged the former because they werent being trusted and the latter because of fears of accusations of racism if black staff were given difficult feedback there may be an element of this with the glass cliff phenomenon lock suggests where people who are different from the norm in senior positions are not given the appropriate level of support either because of lack of trust or fear of giving feedback some employees however have felt that the only way to ensure they get good senior positions is to create their own tamara gillan managing director of marketing agency spf did just this when she started her own business it is shocking how many of my contemporaries have encountered the glass cliff since i left them to start my own business she says one friend faces it right now should she accept the new board position or not knowing that the roles first task is near impossible i am confident that she will take the position but the only sure away to avoid the glass cliff is to start your own company however with estimates on how many new businesses fail within the first four years ranging from to this may just be creating a

at brent council exactly half our senior managers defined as earning or above are women and we have won a string of awards for gender equality what has helped us recruit and retain senior women however is our determination not to treat them as a special case recruiting more women to top jobs offers local government significant benefits access to a wider pool of talent in a competitive labour market and a management tier that is more representative of the population yet even in local government where three quarters of the national workforce are women the senior jobs are still dominated by men according to a survey by the local government employers organisation just a fifth of chief executives were women a quarter of chief officers and a third of their deputies worklife balance policies and flexible working are among the most fruitful tactics for creating an environment where women can thrive and progress to more senior positions if that is what they want brents worklife balance initiative offers staff a wide variety of flexible working options such as compressed hours flexitime parttime working time off in lieu home working and job sharing but we deliberately avoided badging our worklife balance scheme as family friendly the initiative has been aligned with diversity instead and we have stressed that the flexibility it offers is for all people who want to pursue sports hobbies study or religious commitments instead of stereotyping women as the beneficiaries we wanted to ensure that all our members of our staff consider their work life balance phase two of the worklife balance initiative focuses on parents and carers dads as well as mums male carers as well as women however we know that most women still do the lions share of childcare and caring for elderly or disabled relatives so we know that women will benefit from these measures basing flexible working schemes around women returning to work after having a baby may make sense superficially but it ends up marginalising and stigmatising both the policy and the women who are supposed to benefit from it women want their employer to have positive practices that work for them and work for all not to be singled out and a treated as a special case this is not to say no one should ever speak up for women for fear of being branded a rabid feminist ensuring your organisations commitment to gender equality is public and visible is vital at brent we celebrate international womens day and our womens staff forum organises regular events messages from the top are important the willingness of senior women to work flexibly sets an important example to those lower down the scale and may inspire them to go for promotion but again it is important to get across that gender equality is a core value of the organisation a matter for men as much as women it helps that our gender equalities champion is a man our chief executive gareth daniel getting men involved in gender equality can be effective for example our environment and culture department has traditionally been dominated by men in contrast to the rest of the council we set up a mens group to think up solutions they proposed that we train relatively junior women to sit on senior appointment panels by four heads of service and an assistant director post were filled by women these measures ensure that the whole workforce signs up to working practices that suit women and that these approaches get hardwired into the organisational culture the increase in women in senior management was rapid following the introduction of these measures since we launched the worklife balance initiative in more of our senior managers are women this increase does not reflect an influx of women into brent the overall proportion of female staff has remained steady at around get your culture right and gender equality will follow of its own accord when we ran a leadership course for the top managers there was no need to handpick women we just

glass ceilings are not known for shattering quietly yet for one group of women climbing the career ladder in britain the breakthrough has come with barely a sound with little fanfare and often minimal recognition in the public consciousness asian women professionals and entrepreneurs in the uk are rising to new heights and beating a path for a generation of ambitious young women behind them government figures are beginning to tell the story asian businesses are growing three times faster than mainstream businesses in the uk and one in five new asian enterprises are now set up by women launched five years ago the southern jewel awards celebrate the achievement of south asians in the public and private sector women medics and chefs and femalerun businesses from property development to childrens homes were among those shortlisted in this years awards which were sponsored by lloyds tsb among the winners was superna sethi a tanzaniaborn hindu punjabi raised in surrey whose company manhattan properties developed from one flat bought on a credit card to a portfolio of highend bespoke properties catering to the rich and famous in some of londons poshest postcodes sethi who chooses everything from the curtains to the aftershave for her wealthy cash buyers says her respect for her parents years of hard work in britain for little reward inspired both her drive and her determination to go into business shortlisted for another award was dipna anand a yearold pioneer of healthy indian cookery who is already spreading her enthusiasm for gheefree meals through lectures and television appearances as well as managing her fathers restaurant brilliant in southall anand dubbed the asian jamie oliver for her charmingly zealous approach to food hopes to become her generations first indian celebrity chef the successes of these women are of course only part of the picture research published jointly this month by the department for work and pensions and the equal opportunities commission reveals how family responsibilities and in particular the cultural obligation not to use childcare are holding back bangladeshi and pakistani women in britain from entering employment the research which showed that the women believed education and work were crucial to their independence and selfworth highlights yawning differences in employment patterns among women in britains asian communities it showed that around of bangladeshi and of pakistani women of working age are not in fulltime education or work compared with of all other ethnic groups the pay gap suffered by different groups of women compared with white british men illustrates the rift still more starkly pakistani women earn over less per hour than men and bangladeshi women less while indian women suffer a much smaller penalty of less than the pay gap affecting white female workers zohra moosa senior policy officer for race and gender at the fawcett society notes that a division exists among asian women between those stellar women who rocket up the ladder whether in business or often in senior public sector jobs and those still struggling to turn their aspirations and increasingly strong qualifications into employment opportunities despite growing educational success and career aspirations among rising generations of pakistani and bangladeshi girls employers do still discriminate moosa argues there are still stereotypes based probably on the first generation of immigrants that are holding them back there are still ideas that women will just be around for a little bit and then they will get married and be off the new generation of highflyers among asian women in britain includes many of pakistani and bangladeshi origin as well as those of indian descent stresses lucinda platt senior lecturer at the institute for social and economic research at essex university but while asian girls from all backgrounds are forging ahead in education including at degree level that is not yet translating into labour market success for all groups employer stereotyping or wariness of muslim women often distinguishable by their hijab or headscarf could be a factor dr platt suggests the wealthier british indian community with its history of entrepreneurship could also find it easier to lend support to women to dodge such stereotyping and go it alone in business even among asians who clearly fit moosas stellar women category the climb up the employment ladder has often been far from easy kamel hothi asian markets director for the lloyds tsb group faced hurdles in juggling career hopes and family duties that would have daunted all but the most determined now she came to england aged six when her father moved his punjabi sikh family from india in search of a better life family restrictions prevented her going to university to study to become a nurse but a job as a cashier in her local tsb branch led to her promotion as the banks first asian bank manager and ultimately a climb up the corporate ladder to director level in the newly merged organisation hothi founded the banks first asian strategy to improve its relations with and business offers to minority ethnic communities and developed her own cultural and networking course for asian staff within the organisation she describes her jekyll and hyde existence as a bank worker by day and sikh mother wife and daughterinlaw at home in the evenings i had to convince my own family and then my husbands she says it was winning their belief and reconfirming their trust in me that i was not going to run away or cut my hair and that i was going to leave the western world behind me when i came through the door meanwhile at work she began to notice that her hard work and respectful attitude towards her superiors far from winning her promotion at first held her back a lesson she has now used in developing her cultural training course she now explains to fellow minority workers the power of networking and stresses the importance of showcasing personal achievement without feeling uncomfortable now in her s hothi reckons she is caught between the second and third generation of immigrants able to have a career but without the opportunities now opening to girls asian women are allowing their daughters to go away to university now she says and they are coming back with more fire in their bellies than their fathers or brothers they are beginning to make their mark and companies are starting to realise that if you employ women it will help the culture asian women still face barriers she cautions we still have to demonstrate that we can do a mans job then go home and look after the children we would be the first one of a couple to leave a job to look after the children but with more flexible work the options are there now sethi coowner of manhattan properties with business partner harjit singh notes there are very few asian women bosses in the property industry you have to work times harder than a man she says regardless of whether you are asian or not men are still up that ladder it is so unfair because women are equally qualified and we can multitask and juggle better than men the younger third generation of asian girls is eager for career opportunities she argues but it will be up to parents to ensure that they maintain that hunger it goes back to family roots it is important not to hand them everything on a plate they have to feel they need to work anand at just agrees that her generation feels it has something to offer just as the boys have girls she suggests are ambitious but also bring the care and dedication to their work that boys sometimes lack when she marries she adds she may hand over her restaurant role but will

the allegation has been rampant in modern feminism most recently expressed by an addled sally field at the emmy awards that a world ruled by women would be just and peaceful women according to this view are naturally benevolent and collaborative never mind boudicca and margaret thatcher with their fists full of spears any dames that truly matter will brain the roaring lion with the nappy lambs paw are men cutthroat bareknuckle egotists out for the main chance while women cuddle and coo over the tender babe of social welfare do men affiliate by instinctively forming ruthless teams on the battlefield or verdant pitch that seek victory at any cost is mens worship of power a sexual perversion their lordly wave of the phallus forcing the world on to bended knee if it were really true that women selflessly cooperate while men jostle and trample for supremacy then women would be the personification of democracy which taps the popular will some modern women may retain an atavistic loyalty to the primal horde the sprawling extended family that flourished around the rude campsite in the huntergatherer period for thousands of years into the agrarian era food preparation and infant care was an intricate group endeavour managed by women who guarded the hearth and eventually became its symbol from my long observation women of differing nationalities ethnicities and races seem virtually at first meeting to fall immediately into speaking the same rapid candid often humorous language of practical concerns a commonsense attentiveness to the basic needs of children and families but civilisation is not merely about subsistence and survival it is also a projection of higher values conflict and even war may unfortunately be built into human evolution advanced societies emerging from different traditions may be unable to coexist without surrender or dilution of identity certain radical strains of egalitarian feminism turned over time into a grinding tyranny of the group an attack upon the very premises of beauty distinction or achievement this is a vulgarisation of the democratic ideal human beings are not simply animals driven by physical needs adequate food shelter and medical care are urgent desirables but will never satisfy spiritual hungers and in any case women in their social lives are hardly model democrats on the contrary women seem to generate pitiless cliques with rueful regularity chronicled in movies over the seven decades from stage door to mean girls the competitive spirit manifests itself among women in lacerating mutual scrutiny exacerbated in our imagesaturated era by parading celebrities and fashion models the familiar feminist charge is that women are brainwashed into superficialities by an oppressive patriarchy and a sexist media establishment but womens withering judgmentalism about other women may be subliminally sparked by a cruel darwinian imperative the future of the human race is still contained in the lambent glow of dewily nubile young women whom men of all ages dreamily pursue the ageing woman is frankly dispensable sidelined through biology not culture men may be inherently more democratic in their ability to take a punch shake hands with the opponent and toddle off to the pub together for a glass no hard feelings its just men jockeying for turf and having a laugh but women who intimately pairbond from girlhood hold grudges for aeons its harder to build a consensus through political compromise when feelings are so hypertuned to wispy slights western womens remarkable advance into professional careers over the past century has been followed by their relatively new embrace of team sports the latter will surely be a crucible for political education democratic solidarity and flexibility

marina warner insofar as women are underdogs we acquire survival skills through cooperation and negotiation are quick to sense potential friends and defenders form a group and develop a nose for

click here for part one we know that all parents are under more than the pressure of time today amongst the biggest influences on children are the internet tv commercial advertising and like many parents i feel im struggling to set the boundaries so that children can be safe and thats why we have asked dr tanya byron to look at how families can make the most of the opportunities new technology gives while doing our duty to protect children from harmful material and to honour those who raised us i can affirm our commitment to restore the link between the basic state pension and earnings its time also to make public services personal to the needs of the elderly more control over personal social care budgets more choice managing chronic care a wider range of services from home helps to district nurses better personal care so that older people can choose to stay in their own homes i want to ensure for all those who have served the community all their lives respect dignity and security in old age and everything we build we build on a strong foundation of economic stability our commitment to stability has been tested again and again over ten years the asian crisis the russian crisis the american recession the trebling of oil prices and in the last month a wave of financial turbulence that started in america and then germany and has impacted on all countries including the united kingdom and tested the stability of our financial system yesterday alistair darling set out how we will continue to respond with the same calm vigilance that he has demonstrated over recent weeks and it is because of the strength of the british economy that we are able to steer a path of low inflation low interest rates and stable growth ten years ago before a labour government we were th in the g for income per head now we are second only to the usa above germany above france above italy above japan above canada with the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in the history of our country and in britain where once there were three million unemployed there are today more men and women in jobs than ever in our history for the first time over million people in work and we will continue to intensify the reform of the new deal remove every barrier show we can have flexibility and fairness together to advance to a britain of full employment in our generation and we will build on one of the greatest achievements of our labour and trade union movement the national minimum wage next week we will again raise the national minimum wage to an hour and because we will do more for vulnerable workers in all companies and in all places the minimum wage will be enforced without exception and next week for the first time on top of holiday entitlement days paid public holidays guaranteed we should take pride that under a labour government britain this small number of people on this small island is the fifth largest economy in the world as we set out on the next stage of our journey this is our vision britain leading the global economy by our skills and creativity by our enterprise and flexibility by our investment in transport and infrastructure a world leader in science a world leader in financial and business services a world leader in energy and the environment from nuclear to renewables a world leader in the creative industries and yes modern manufacturing too drawing on the talents of all to create british jobs for british workers there is another aspiration i have heard across the country ive met too many young couples whove told me we work hard we save we play by the rules we want to get on and yet we cant afford to buy or even rent our first home so we plan to help first time buyers and we will increase housebuilding to new homes a year in places and ways that respect our green spaces and the environment my aim by two million more homeowners than in and for the first time in nearly half a century we will show the imagination to build new towns ecotowns with low and zero carbon homes and today because of the response we have received we are announcing that instead of just new eco towns we will now aim for ten eco towns building thousands of new homes in every region of the country and for affordable housing and for social housing we will now invest billion this will mean a per cent increase in funds for social housing i call on all housing associations and councils of all political parties not only to support shared equity for first time buyers but to help us build more social homes for rent more homes for key workers and more homes to cut the unacceptable levels of overcrowding good homes to rent and buy for the british people a strong britain is a britain of strong communities where by accepting our mutual obligations to each other we can make our homes our streets and our neighbourhoods safe those who choose to disobey the laws of our land their crimes the pain they inflict that danger and immorality threaten the rights and security of every citizen no parent should ever have to endure the suffering of the family of rhys jones the young boy callously murdered in liverpool on wednesday august nd and the reason the people of britain have been so shocked is that amongst the vast majority of us there is an abhorrence of guns in our society that is why we took the right decision to ban handguns and now we need to deal with the illegal supply of guns two thirds of deaths from gun crime occur in just four cities in the last few weeks jacqui smith and i have focussed on the specific areas in these cities where as i saw on saturday at first hand the police will now match intensive uniformed patrolling and extensive undercover work with the use of stop and search powers and dispersal powers reinforced by new handheld weapon detectors and all backed up at a national level by the work of the organised crime agency and our border force rigorously targeting and stopping the illegal entry of guns my answer to crime and disorder our policy is to both punish and prevent to punish for anyone over illegally carrying a gun a fiveyear sentence to prevent in our schools intensive education warning about guns and knives and teachers encouraged to use new powers to confiscate weapons and in our communities ex gang members helping us pull young people out of gangs to punish the evil of drug pushers who poison our children i want the tough new powers that have already closed over one thousand crack houses in some areas of the country to be used in all areas of the country and to encourage local police to use new powers to confiscate drug profits more of the confiscated funds will go direct to the police and local communities to prevent addiction we will extend drug education and expand drug treatment and we will send out a clear message that drugs are never going to be decriminalised there are now police officers and community support officers more officers than ever before and by april th next year every community will have its own neighbourhood policing team and i can announce that we will provide hand held computers now by next year right across the country cutting paper work so that officers can log crimes on the spot stay on the beat and not waste time returning to the station to fill out forms so yes we will strengthen the police yes we will strengthen our laws but preventing crime for me also means all of us as a community setting boundaries between what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour with clear penalties for stepping over the line boundaries that reflect the words i was taught when i was young words upon which we all know strong communities are founded discipline respect responsibility bullying is unacceptable and unacceptable too is disrupting a classroom so to punish we will give teachers the support they need to exclude to prevent parents held accountable fined if they fail to supervise and so that these young people are not left to hang around street corners councils and authorities obligated to maintain their education and supervision binge drinking and underage drinking that disrupt neighbourhoods are unacceptable to punish let me tell the shops that repeatedly sell alcohol to those who are under age we will take your licences away to prevent councils should use new powers to ban alcohol in trouble spots and i call on the industry to do more to advertise the dangers of teenage drinking ive met young people and pensioners alike who say they want to feel safe when they go out but also that young people need somewhere to go and something to do so respect must be a two way street as we take action against antisocial behaviour so too we must take action that could transform our communities by providing the kind of facilities young people want and need so we will use unclaimed assets in dormant bank accounts to build new youth centres and we will invest over million pounds so that in every community there are places for young people to go with youth budgets let us say to young people for the first time you will have a say over how the money is spent i believe we have not done enough in the last ten years to emphasise that in return for the rights we all have there are responsibilities we all owe new rights to better health care but you have to show up and not miss your appointment new rights to educational maintenance allowances but you have to show you are working hard new rights to higher maternity allowances but you have to meet with a health visitor the right for company boards to make their own decisions but obligations to the rest of society too and an understanding that if you come to our country you not only learn our language and culture you must play by the rules in july i announced a new unified border force and already the first elements are in place a stronger uniformed presence at ports customs officers targeting illegal immigration stronger security checks at passport control by next year id cards for foreign nationals and we will start to count people in and out and we will move forward with our new australianstyle pointsbased approach to immigration so britain will continue to benefit from skilled workers from abroad and they will understand their responsibilities to earn the right to settle in britain but let me be clear any newcomer to britain who is caught selling drugs or using guns will be thrown out no one who sells drugs to our children or uses guns has the right to stay in our country and to achieve a britain of mutual obligation i am convinced that we need a new kind of politics i continue to reach out to all those who work hard and play by the rules who believe in strong families and a patriotic britain who may have supported other parties but who like me want to defend and advance british values and our way of life all of the challenges we have to face can only be met by listening to and involving the british people themselves and i have no doubt that the best answer to disengagement from our democracy is to renew our democracy and that means more change change to make the executive more accountable thats why parliament will make the final decisions about peace and war change to strengthen our liberties to uphold the freedom of speech freedom of information and the freedom to protest change to strengthen local democracy with new powers for economic development and bus services and i pay tribute to the work of our local labour councillors across the country change within our own party now for the first time to decide our policy one member one vote and yes change to the house of lords and we will in our manifesto commit to introduce the principle of elections for the second chamber perhaps the biggest challenge for the new politics is to show how we as a community can join together to safeguard the environment to turn the silent rising tide of global warming and i am proud that britain will now become the first country in the world to write into law binding limits on carbon emissions but i am not satisfied so i am asking the new independent climate change committee to report on whether the per cent reduction in emissions by which is already bigger than most other countries should be even stronger still and by investing in energy efficiency renewables carbon capture clean fuels and new environmental technologies i want britain to lead in carbonfree vehicles carbonfree homes and carbonfree industry and i want the new green technologies of the future to be the source of british jobs in british businesses and i commit to work tirelessly for a new postkyoto un climate change agreement with yes to help the poorest binding targets for all the richest countries and let me say we in britain cannot be good stewards of the environment unless we are good internationalists and that means being good europeans too at all times we will stand up for the british national interest and i accept my responsibility to write in detail into the amended european treaty the red lines we have negotiated for britain and whether its environmental economic or security cooperation we will hold fast to the partnerships with our closest ally america our membership of the european union the commonwealth and our commitment to the united nations you know there is a golden thread of common humanity that across nations and faiths binds us together and it can light the darkest corners of the world and the message should go out to anyone facing persecution anywhere from burma to zimbabwe human rights are universal and no injustice can last forever people will look back on events in darfur as they did in rwanda and say why did you the most powerful countries in the world fail to act to come to the aid of those with the least power who can fail to be moved by the mother in darfur who saved her two youngest children from militias and hid them away she rushed back to her village to find her husband and older son murdered and then was repeatedly raped by the janjaweed all for being a member of the wrong tribe all for acting upon that shared human impulse to protect her own children her story touches our deepest conscience and summons us to act in my first weeks i went to the united nations where we fought for and secured a clear and unequivocal unresolution we have sent a message directly to the government of sudan make progress or face tougher new sanctions and we will not rest until there is an end to the aerial bombings a ceasefire a lasting political settlement and justice for the women and children of darfur one of the great challenges we now face is to work for peace and security in the middle east tony blair for thirteen years the leader of our party is now leading in the middle east peace effort and let me here acknowledge the contribution he is making now and the debt we owe as a party and as a country to tony blair and as the northern ireland assembly meets thanks also to the work of tony blair let us celebrate that northern ireland is now building prosperity because it is now enjoying peace and working internationally for understanding and reconciliation across borders neil kinnock here with us today is chairing the british council and let me also acknowledge the debt of gratitude we in this party owe to him because we will do our duty and discharge our obligations we will work in iraq and afghanistan for three objectives security political reconciliation and economic reconstruction and at all times we will do everything to ensure the security of our dedicated armed forces let me say there should be no safe haven no hiding place anywhere in the world for alqaida and terrorism to prevail in this struggle will require more than military force and we will work with our allies to isolate extremism and win the battle of hearts and minds i tell you today there is a global poverty emergency today million children do not go to school i want us inspired by nelson mandelas lead to take a campaign to every corner of the world so that we will be the first generation to ensure every child in every country in every continent has the right to go to school every year million die from diseases we could have the medicine and science to prevent and cure if in the th century human ingenuity could put a man on the face of the moon then surely in this st century human compassion can lift the pain from the face of a suffering child so let us be the first generation to ensure that every infant child and mother is protected against and that we eliminate the scourges of tuberculosis polio diphtheria malaria and hivaids for sixty years britain has shown the way to health care not as a privilege to be paid for but as a fundamental human right better than any other endeavour the nhs expresses our mutual obligation to each other because all of us need help some of the time it is the best insurance policy in the world ive been round the country and ive been visiting hospitals gp surgeries health centres i have listened to and i have heard the british people they know when they have a medical emergency the nhs is there for them and at its best they tell me of their huge admiration for our doctors our nurses and our nhs staff and we do not thank them enough and we should do so now i know too there are real concerns about basic things that need to change getting in to see your gp when you need to being confident the ward in your hospital will be clean and at every stage being treated as an individual with respect so yes there is work to do but let us be clear the british people do not want to remove the nhs bit by bit they want to improve the nhs year by year and why shouldnt all british people and not just some be able to see their doctor at the time they want at the hospital or clinic they want not at a time someone else wants so let me set out how we take the nhs into a new era our great achievement of the s was a service universal to all in we need a service that is accessible to all and personal to all our great ambition now a national health service that is also a personal health service and we now have to make big practical changes to set a new standard of service mrsa and cdifficile are this centurys hospital diseases which every modern country is now having to root out and to make sure every hospital is clean and safe following best practice around the world there will be new funds direct to every hospital for a deep clean of our wards we will more than double the number of hospital matrons to we will give matrons and ward sisters in all wards the powers to report cleaning contractors and safety concerns directly to hospital boards and a stronger health care commission and i can announce that matrons will have the power to order additional cleaning and send out a message meet the highest standards of cleanliness or lose your contract i want an nhs personal to you because you are seen by a consultant in a matter of days not months personal to you because there is a right to be given xray results quickly and time to discuss your treatment personal to you because we know that being unwell is not just a nine to five problem and so we will make gp hours more friendly to families open up opportunities to see a gp near your place of work as well as your home expand walk in centres medical services at pharmacies and ensure a better service from nhs direct i know the most worrying time for women is whenever breast cancer is suspected thats when you need an nhs personal to you on best medical advice we will now extend the ages for breast cancer screening by six years treat every suspected breast cancer as urgent and guarantee your consultant can fast track you and we will also extend colon cancer screening right up the age scale into your seventies i can also say that following the review by professor darzi my aim for the next stage of an nhs personal to you for every adult a regular check up on the nhs in july i met liam fairhurst a twelveyearold boy who won the diana princess of wales medal for raising money for cancer and leukaemia research and he was raising money in memory of a childhood friend who died from cancer even as he himself is fighting the disease and i believe this too is a mission for our generation over the next ten years i am proud to announce that through the medical research council and the nhs together britain will invest more than ever before billion of public money financing the genius of british researchers and doctors as they convert breakthroughs in genetics stem cell research and new drugs into cures and vaccines to combat cancer and the deadliest of diseases my vision of the nhs an nhs that is both pioneering new cures and personal to you and why do i believe so strongly in the nhs when i was at school it was football rugby running sports these were what i did all the time and so i was fitter then but when i was sixteen when i was playing for my school rugby team against our former pupils someone accidentally kicked me near my eyes and from the age of to i spent a lot of time in hospital as the nhs worked to save my sight i learned that with a simple twist of fate life can change it was the skills of a surgeon the care of wonderful nurses the attention and yes the love and care of the nhs staff that managed to save one of my eyes and it is because of the nhs that i can see the words i read today the experiences we live through shape the way we think of the world experiences like these have made me the person i am sometimes people say i am too serious and i fight too hard and maybe thats true but these experiences taught me what families all across britain know that things dont always come easy and there are things worth fighting for like so many people across this country i have the best of reasons to believe in the lifesaving power of the nhs and the liberating power of education and for making them both the best they can be so this is my pledge to the british people i will not let you down i will stand up for our schools and our hospitals i will stand up for british values i will stand up for a strong britain and i will always stand up for you,2007-09,click part one know parent pressure time today amongst

zoe williams belief that it is daft to give the same benefits to rich and poor the means to an end september is misguided she complains that the newly announced pregnancy grant for women potentially worth up to wont be meanstested this is the modern way with initiatives she says especially in the realm of babies and other sentimentalised demographic groups she acknowledges that the alternative is complicated but she adds the answer is not to shrug and say too complex cant be bothered lets just give the cash to everyone in doing so she shows a lack of understanding of the impact of universal nonmeanstested benefits on reducing child poverty and the failure of the meanstested approach the gap between the richest and poorest has grown alongside the increased use of meanstesting in the welfare system child poverty action group has long argued that universal benefits are more effective at reaching the poorest families targeting financial support inevitably brings more complexity and is accompanied by stigma which can lead to reluctance to claim overall takeup of the meanstested child tax credit is around for working tax credit it is around but takeup of child benefit is around universal child benefit has reached more lowincome families than any of the meanstested payments specifically designed for them the work and pensions select committees report benefits simplification published in july slammed the current system as stunningly complicated the department for work and pensions alone administers around benefits each with different rules as williams acknowledges the treasurymanaged tax credits system adds a new layer of complexity which is far from seamless in its relation to the benefits system such is the overall complexity that the taxpayer now loses more money to official and claimant error than to fraud we once had less meanstesting for benefits not more as williams suggests alongside more for taxation this has been reversed with substantial meanstesting of benefits and tax credits and the value of the remaining universal benefits falling well behind earnings meanwhile taxation has shifted to indirect taxes which hit the poorest harder the consequences for poor children are dire yes meanstested tax credits have helped lift children out of poverty but the most recent figures show child poverty rising again with million children living in poverty the joseph rowntree foundation has predicted that if we continue to rely primarily on meanstested tax credits to end child poverty it will cost us around bn more a year by so meanstesting will continue to nibble at the edges whereas universal benefits in tandem with progressive taxation can address the underlying inequalities williams should really be calling for more

its a long time since sisters were burning their bras for equality but whats to get angry about today we ask a panel of young feminists about modern sexual warfare my mother and i are in the pub i tell her that im researching a piece about britains young feminists my mother who is in her s and was inspired by reading germaine greers the female eunuch when she was a seventies housewife looks astonished but there arent any she says with the finality of a lid being placed on a saucepan its easy to understand her pessimism last year i interviewed the american writer ariel levy author of female chauvinist pigs who worried about the lack of awareness among young women which is ironic when at the same time they feel apologetic for how far theyve got they have lost sight of how hard it was to get where we are now thirtyfive years on from the first issue of spare rib fear and loathing seem to swirl around anything to do with feminism in surveys around threequarters of women regularly say that they would not call themselves feminists indeed if theres an f word on every womans lips its more likely to be fertility than feminism but in the past months six feminist magazines have launched and on the internet there are hundreds of feminist blogs these are not the clichd dungaree wearers of yesteryear these are women who are smart funny articulate cool i had imagined that they would be the daughters of seventies feminists but many seem to have had feminism thrust upon them at school they were told they could have it all when they left they realised that wasnt the case in a way the hurdles are bigger than years ago in those days the injustices were clear today theyre disguised by the idea that because women are presented with more choices the battles have been won but get the women i meet on the subject of pay gaps or sexual harassment raunch culture or glass ceilings and its clear that they havent i talk to my mother about this generation of feminists theyre everywhere i tell her she looks at me with a glint in her eye good she says tell me about them lf marie berry knockback magazine how did you become a feminist the feminism tag has been thrust upon knockback my antidote to mainstream womens glossies in a way i dont use the word myself however if people want to call us feminist thats fine by me how are you different from your mums generation when my parents were engaging in feminism it was fresh and new now it needs to be rebranded are men necessary i dont need men but i definitely really like them my boyfriend today is a massive girl about everything he wants to know where our relationship is going and being ridiculously cosmo about the whole thing what are the clichs about feminism the problem is that too often feminism is whiny and depressing it is not fun and it is not interesting can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club i hate sordid lapdancing clubs but not in a political sense they just dont do anything for me i know a lot of strippers and lots of them would call themselves feminists what makes you angry the assumption that women only want to read about makeup and other peoples problems pisses me off on an hourly basis i like shoes dont get me wrong but i dont want to read about them charlotte cooper subtext magazine how did you become a feminist one night a man followed me home and attacked me badly suddenly i became a victim and realised that this had happened because im a woman it made me understand that there is no protection for women and helped inspire me to launch subtext how are you different from your mums generation everyone thinks feminism is over and were all equal and we dont have to fight for anything i think feminism is about reawakening people to the fact that there are still big problems are men necessary its not just a womens movement its a social movement its about finding balance and equal ground we cant do it by ourselves men have got to make a change too what are the clichs about feminism the dungarees the ladies with moustaches i sometimes think that if you are fat and a feminist you get an easier ride from other feminists because youre seen to be outside the scope of what is wanted of women by men can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club somehow the sexual revolution has become all skewed and poledancing is something women do to keep fit it trivialises what it is what makes you angry i try to look at things with a wry smile its more palatable to people if you make a joke of it because they dont feel pressurised we dont have to be scary women as feminists its nice to have a laugh about it nathalie blue ladyfestlondon how did you become a feminist bikini kill was my catalyst when i was young i always believed in songs there was one particular riot grrl mixtape that someone made me when i was that got me thinking it was fantastic and now i work for ladyfest which is a festival for female artists how are you different from your mums generation were not as angry as our mums generation were luckier in that weve got better health services and education and as feminists were better at blending in were ninja feminists though i almost wore dungarees to the photoshoot just to give the people what they want are men necessary im glad to grow up saying men are part of the solution we need strong male role models what are the clichs about feminism the clichs are that were all gay white middle class manhaters with no sense of humour and that we dont shave our legs actually that one might be true can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club there are still lines that you cant cross as a feminist however blurred they may be its easier to go to a lapdancing club as a stripper than a punter otherwise what are you getting out of it what makes you angry shows like how to look ten years younger and how to look good naked the idea of finding your own style is a feminist idea but theyve spun the things we worked so hard for into trash sarah barnes uplift magazine how did you become a feminist i see it as commonsense why would it be ok for women to be treated differently from men im not an academic feminist when i put together uplift it was definitely an emotional thing for me its a liberating thing too i feel feminism empowers everybody how are you different from your mums generation the meaning of it seems to be changing from within and its becoming more welcoming too the older generation of feminists want to keep it more pure but i think that makes it less powerful are men necessary women need men because everybody needs everybody else i cant imagine society without diversity what are the clichs about feminism clichs are all confused braburning never happened yes were such a mixed group that there are sure to be some hairy women and some lesbians but we all need to get over this performance of being a woman can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club im still discovering my ideas about the whole burlesquestriptease side of feminism what makes you angry the media gets my goat magazines play to our fears about performing as a woman traditional womens magazines are all about pleasing men cate sevilla cupcatevoxcom how did you become a feminist i grew up in a republican family in california no one talked about feminism ive realised since living in london that people treat me differently because im an opinionated woman so i started cupcate which brings together femaleorientated blogs how are you different from your mums generation second wave feminists tell me im a bad feminist because im married and wear makeup but i think its about choice and respecting other people women especially are men necessary of course though not george bush what are the clichs about feminism i wear a tshirt with the slogan this is what a feminist looks like because i dont fit the stereotypes feminism means having the balls to confront the stereotypes i mean i have a husband i buy makeup i wear high heels im a feminist can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club im not interested in good feminists and bad feminists i can do whatever i want so long as im aware of why im doing it the important thing is to make informed decisions what makes you angry i dont like being paid less than men in the office and i know that i am i get angry about girlfriends who stay with arsehole boyfriends because they think that is how they deserve to be treated atiha sengupta playwright how did you become a feminist my family is all about equality my mum is an activist for southall black sisters and she helps rehabilitate women in prison i was going on marches from the age of four but i didnt realise i was being politicised how are you different from your mums generation were less radicalised and more fragmented our aims have changed but our battles are harder theres less collective feeling too because were a more atomised society what are the clichs about feminism were less radicalised and more fragmented our aims have changed but our battles are harder theres less collective feeling too because were a more atomised society can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club in an ideal world women would not lapdance for money in an ideal world it would be fine to dance naked but the minute moneys involved it becomes dangerous what makes you angry i despise jordan and peter theyre dim but dangerous and amy winehouse made me mad when she said that she just wanted to be a wife jess mccabe thefwordorguk how did you become a feminist i grew up with feminist values but rediscovered feminism at university i got into hong kong action films and it was so empowering to watch female characters be so physically powerful i started editing thefwordorguk this year how are you different from your mums generation our priorities and perspectives are different perhaps the challenges faced by young feminists or feminists in general today are to do with changing social attitudes which is actually incredibly difficult are men necessary of course they are half of the human race to be honest i dont really like the question if its turned around for example if someone asked whether women are necessary its obvious why its kind of offensive what are the clichs about feminism theres a tiny bit of truth in some of the clichs but its been mangled and spun out of all proportion i think theyre more interesting in what they say about societys attitudes to women in particular women who speak out against sexism and to challenge traditional gender roles can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club going to a lapdancing club would be completely abhorrent to many feminists because it would involve participating in the sexual exploitation of another woman but yes you can do it and still be a feminist no one will take your feminist card away what makes you angry people who believe that women are to blame if they are raped while drunk wearing a short skirt or walking down the street on their own make me angry the book men are from mars women are from venus and the attitude it embodies makes me angry too mina rai rights of women how did you become a feminist after moving here from india when i was i started a law degree and started getting into feminism but it wasnt something that happened its always been integral to who i am it just developed and i found a name for it now im working for the rights of women how are you different from your mums generation my generation of women are doing so much to bring feminism to the forefront i think were rebranding it the internet has opened so many doors theres easy access to groups its changing the notion of activism are men necessary being a feminist has affected relationships with a few friends like one guy who always insisted on paying for me and insisted on looking after me we dont talk any more but of course women need men the point of feminism isnt to make one single female race what are the clichs about feminism i dont want to dwell on the obvious clichs attached to feminism because its a shame that the public fails to recognise all the people involved in the movement can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club if one woman feels empowered by it thats great for her but we tend to forget that there are still thousands of women that face sexual violence everyday and the myths such as it was her fault because she was wearing this that or the other that isnt very liberating at all what makes you angry at rights for women we give free legal advice to women we get around attempted calls a year but only get to take around its really hard to think of all those women we dont have the resources to help kat banyard fem conferences how did you become a feminist when i was growing up i took for granted that it had all been achieved then i discovered that this isnt how the world works i started fem conferences because i wanted to be able to go somewhere to be inspired and there wasnt anything like it how are you different from your mums generation we have come a hell of a long way it was only in that rape in marriage was made illegal there is a lot to celebrate this generation of women think that they can be whoever they want are men necessary my partner is a feminist he has got involved because im so passionate about it he couldnt really avoid it the thing about feminism is that it makes you reassess yourself and your relationship and inevitably it means changing things in your personal life what are the clichs about feminism feminists are angry feminists dont like men its so ridiculous but you have to take it seriously because it stops so many people engaging with the issues even if a feminist was angry and hairy then so what its not important can you be a feminist and go to a lapdancing club i dont think you have to pass a test to be a feminist if you believe in equality and you still feel the desire to dance up and down a pole then good for you i hope you enjoy it what makes you angry it makes me angry that violence against women is so endemic it not only irritates me it horrifies me it causes more death

every year women in britain are sacked made redundant or leave their jobs because of pregnancy discrimination according to a new book which highlights the raw deal mothers have in the workplace despite recent changes in the jobs market with more women being offered flexible hours and paternity leave for fathers juggling work commitments and young children is still a struggle for many families according to the author joanna grigg her book collapsing careers describes how many women are forced into lowerpaid jobs when they start a family because employers are unwilling to adapt to their needs i dont feel its getting better at work in quite the way that younger women might assume it is said grigg who herself had to leave work when she had children we are raising girls to believe that they can have it all and at the moment the workplaces are not delivering the changes a lot of offices are still quite archaic in their attitudes and they need to be dragged into the st century she said her argument is that although the government is trying to lift the barriers for women many factors conspire to make it very difficult for them to compete on the same ground as men she points out that british women suffer the largest wage gap of all european countries with a per cent pay divide between male and female fulltime staff and a per cent difference between the sexes for parttime work but we partly have ourselves to blame said grigg girls are more likely to choose badlypaid careers such as caring over highearning sectors such as science or engineering in spite of the fact that girls outperform boys at school and university we also know that women are less likely to negotiate a good pay rise than men grigg found herself years ago having to leave her job as a sales manager because she could not juggle it with looking after her three boys and instead became an adult education tutor i work hard but at least i do get to spend quality time with my family now she explained the government has promised to address the pay divide between the sexes harriet harman deputy leader of the labour party and the minister for women will draw up proposals later this year on how to tackle the divide and bring more women back into the employment market she said earlier this year during the contest to become deputy leader that she was in favour of forcing private companies to have gender pay audits which would reveal the scale of the discrimination however such a move might prove politically difficult as british industry would argue that it could push up the wages bill a survey published last week carried out by the chartered management institute found that the pay gap between women and men had grown although more females were breaking through the glass ceiling women managers earned an average of last year while men averaged at the same time fairpay cases brought to employment tribunals on grounds of sex discrimination have risen by per cent on last year according

madeleine buntings rage at the persistence of the pay gap comment september is understandable but unless women are given higher hourly pay than men while in work the average compensation received by women over their working life is bound to be lower than that of men because of maternity absences in particular i head a department of around higherpaid managers and analysts in an international bank and we offer extended maternity leave of one year assuming a year working career in the city which is fairly typical a working mother with two children will likely therefore be at work at least less than a male counterpart maternityrelated career interruptions only go some way to explaining the gap but it is unrealistic to expect it can ever disappear completely unless systems to consciously handicap men are applied good employers now make strenuous efforts clearly guided by employment tribunal rulings which have considered issues of indirect and effective discrimination to ensure women can achieve equal pay for equal work the objective of the equal pay act in my view the best way to close the gap is to encourage men to take more career breaks and extend family leave entitlements this would be good for their health and deal with the equally worrying fact that men work longer and die younger tom brown london in stcentury britain its appalling that the gender pay gap in managerial positions is widening its no wonder that many women are turning their backs on conventional employment to set up their own businesses and achieve the financial rewards they deserve the most recent london annual business survey found that more women than ever are setting up businesses femaleowned businesses contribute almost bn to the uk economy making the development of womens enterprise economically essential entrepreneurship provides women with a way to achieve their career ambitions and take control of their income diana robertson business link london the book trade union action on low pay which i coauthored says progress towards equal pay has been so slow that to describe it as moving at snails pace would be to invite accusations of exaggeration this was written in it is very sad that we have to read that this characterisation is still appropriate years later it is also depressing that madeleine buntings incisive wellargued article should attract such hostile though frankly superficial criticism from many bloggers presumably chiefly male on your website their dubious arguments often seem premised on the existence of a mythical free market for labour this flawed assumption conveniently ignores the attitudinal institutional legal and behavioural factors that constrain the operation of the labour market and shape the composition and structure of employment for men and women michael somerton university of hull i have been an accountant for years and i have never been aware of a role attracting less pay because it was filled by a woman rates are normally set prior to picking someone for the role women tend to be on average less careeroriented a hangover from the breadwinnerhomemaker divide the decline of which seems to serve capitalism more than society men who arent particularly careerminded get paid just as badly as any likeminded woman companies pay everyone as little as they can get away with shareholders are the only people given special treatment matt cooper bournemouth dorset a simple catalyst to kickstart equal pay would be to require all employers to publish the salaries of all employees the only reason its one of the last parts of our lives to remain private is to cover the embarrassment that disclosure of indefensible pay differentials would cause this is why the publicsector pay gap is so small pay grades are public

on october women and men across the uk will protest against the gender pay gap currently the worst in western europe why october the fawcett society which is organising the campaign along with unison have calculated that the gender pay gap in which women working fulltime earn on average less an hour than men working fulltime is the equivalent of men getting paid all year and women working for free from this date until the new year breaks its a stark and shocking way to frame an issue that unbelievably is still with us more than years after equal pay and antidiscrimination legislation was introduced in this country indeed at the current crawling rate of change most women alive today will be dead before gender pay equality is a reality what is most interesting about the womens no pay day campaign however is the level of response it has attracted in addition to the hundreds of women and men who have signed a petition on the downing street website more than individual activists from bath to glasgow and a dozen places in between have contacted fawcett to say they will organise a day of action in their local area fawcetts jenny westaway says she is surprised and delighted by the level of response which has surpassed that of other campaigns the organisation has initiated and westaway attributes this swell of support for direct action of course the feminist movement among many others has a strong history of direct action from the early th century suffragettes who chained themselves to railings outside downing street to the plus women who took to the streets in the first womens liberation march in london in yet earlier this month naomi klein raged against the bonoisation of current protest particularly in the uk which she says has reduced discussion to much safer terrain theres celebrities and then theres spectators waving their bracelets its less dangerous and less powerful while this might be true of some campaigns grassroots activism street demonstrations and citizen and community movements seem to me to be increasingly popular from antiwar marches to the rapid growth of the plasticbagfree movement and the climate activists who set up camp at heathrow people clearly arent afraid of doing as well as believing of shaming politicians and wider society into action and todays feminists seem eager to get their hands dirty in this political fight as well as taking part in the important theoretical debates on the pages of newspapers academic journals and feminist blogs reclaim the night marches are being revived by a new generation determined to act against pervasive violence against women while campaigns such as if you cant slap em snap em have inspired many women to directly combat street harassment and while some are satisfied with signing up to a facebook group protesting against the medias objectification of women i believe its a lot more effective and admirable to while balancing on a moving tube escalator scrawl the word lies on a harley medical group poster that proposes bigger breasts will make you happier as a colleague did just this week with the persistent gender pay gap the growing threat to womens right to choose to have an abortion and the recent un report revealing that one in five women around the world will experience rape or attempted rape in her lifetime i could go on and on it is a political impossibility for many of us to stand idly by doing nothing and the womens no pay day campaign seems to have tapped into this taste for action i only wish the fawcett society had taken their protest a step further and suggested that women take direct action by not going to work at all on october or by refusing to undertake the unpaid work that so many must do unrewarded every day in the private sphere unison and

across the world it is women who are driving economic growth over the last years they have filled two out of every three new jobs the term womenomics has been coined to illustrate the increasing role that women are now playing and will continue to play in economic life it certainly represents whats happening in tanzania where i have been meeting african businesswomen the popular saying the african farmer and her husband shows there is nothing new in the essential if hidden role of women in the economy but with so many women setting up their own businesses the motto needs updating to the african entrepreneur and her mobile all this could lead people to believe that the fight for womens rights although not won should be subsumed into the bigger battle for human rights for everyone after all the denial of human rights hits both men and women but while both sexes suffer its still women who suffer most two out of three children denied education are girls women own just per cent of the worlds titled land a fact that makes it very difficult for women entrepreneurs to get bank loans because they have no collateral even in the uk where there has been huge progress women in fulltime work still take home p for every pound that men get paid and the glass ceiling at the top is as unbreakable as ever and importantly these barriers and discrimination are not an accidental byproduct of gender they exist simply because of it they rest on the idea spoken or unspoken that women are somehow not the equal of men that their rights views and interests dont carry the same weight it is this assumption that underpins and links the pay gap in developed countries the denial in some developing countries of a womans right to own property the practice of abortion or infanticide because the child is a girl and that allows rape or honour killings to go unpunished it is the belief that women are worth less than men there are those who while appalled at such prejudice in our societies attempt to excuse it elsewhere as a result of different cultures they argue that it is wrong to impose our standards across the world casting doubt on the concept of universal human rights in a world of diverse cultural and religious standards i believe this is both wrong and patronising as rosalyn higgins the first female judge on the international court of justice noted its an argument advanced by states or by liberal scholars but rarely by the oppressed groups themselves its often based too on a false belief that the idea of universal human rights and the un declaration that made them concrete is a construct of a few western democracies foisted on a reluctant world the declaration was drafted in fact by experts from every background and improved by contributions from all the uns founding members from across the world it was an express statement that the same human rights belong to each and every one of us whatever our race gender religion or background they are a recognition of our essential dignity as human beings something that i would argue has its roots deep in all our great faiths as such they cant be ignored or watered down simply because of claims of cultural difference of course culture doesnt stay the same it is changed by law by education and campaigning look at the seriousness with which our society now treats domestic violence when i first started practising as a barrister years ago it was still very much a hidden crime if reported to the police or courts at all attacks by a husband on his wife were routinely treated as less serious than an assault on a stranger now such cowardly behaviour is rightly seen as an aggravated offence in the middle east too the culture is slowly changing across the gulf women with the support of men are winning the right to vote and are increasingly filling important ministerial positions they are also taking a bigger role in the economy in tanzania and across the developing world innovative credit schemes are springing up to tackle the reluctance of the banks to lend to women despite their better record of repaying loans than men in bangladesh microcredit schemes are also educating women about their rights and training women in the fundamentals of the muslim law of property to help them argue their case economic empowerment and education are making a difference this is not the time to retreat from the fight for womens equality its the time with sensitivity but also firmness to step it up wherever we find prejudice the prize is not just a better world for women it is a better world

carey oppenheim has had a working relationship in one form or another with lisa harker for years including writing a book with her in the summer they were appointed codirectors at the institute for public policy research ippr the progressive thinktank they have worked for in the past together they are among the most senior jobsharers in the country and two of the most influential women in politics their codirectorship is a sign that attitudes are changing theres a strong view generally that leadership is about a single person but were trying to show that there can be different models of leadership says oppenheim people at the ippr have been very adaptable to the fact the person in our office may be either me or lisa oppenheim chose to jobshare because she wanted to spend more time with her two teenage daughters for harker the decision came after an accident that took a long time to recover from i realised during this time that i wanted more time to spend doing other things i liked and have the space to do a variety of things both unpaid and paid she says i wanted to pursue hobbies see friends and family and to reflect on my work generally both women had applied to other positions as a partnership and found reactions varied i think people were quite wary says oppenheim they felt they would be taking a double risk and they couldnt understand why we couldnt just be director and deputy director the two women each work three days a week with one day of crossover and say that if one leaves the job the other will as well were a package says oppenheim so far their staff have reacted extremely well not only do we get two brains instead of one but i think its great that were is setting the example of how flexible working can work to the benefit of everyone in the world of policy and politics says sonia sodha a research fellow at the ippr as with oppenheim and harker samia al qadhi and christine fogg work three days a week as joint chief executives of the charity breast cancer care and are similarly enthusiastic about share leadership not only do you get double the intellectual input at the top of an organisation says al qadhi but it adds rigour to decisions as they are discussed with someone who has an equal commitment to getting them right whats more she adds it massively reduces stress pressure and isolation because you have somebody you trust and whom you talk through worries and anxieties with while there are many examples of women who jobshare few do so in senior positions for men jobshare arrangements are rare at all levels but there are those who buck convention simon toseland shares his post in communications with a female colleague at sustrans the sustainable transport charity he says that arrangements such as his are undervalued if you get the right people then the sum of two people working together can be more than one person working on their own as you have more energy and more enthusiasm and different people bring different approaches to the work says toseland two days a week adam coffman looks after his children the other three days he jobshares with a woman as a senior development officer for ctc the national cyclists organisation though he has worked parttime before this is his first official share we split our role and we take turns to answer the emails and decide who is going to take on each issue says coffman there are few examples of men whose jobshare partners are also men one allmale partnership is mike attwood and stephen jones who are joint chief executives of coventry teaching primary care trust for oppenheim this is a sign of success in changing perceptions toward the balance of work and care jenny westaway of the fawcett society which campaigns for gender equality would like to see more jobsharing for both men and women at the moment you have the right to request flexible working in certain circumstances such as having a child under a certain age she says this has definitely made a difference to employees and most requests are granted but one of the shortcomings of the rules is that you have to have worked somewhere for a number of weeks before you can request this so thats different to applying to jobshare from the beginning we want to see flexible working and jobshares among the whole workforce as a matter of course in politics i think a jobshare prime minister might be difficult adds oppenheim but it would be really interesting to see whether you could have a job share at ministerial level jobshare uk wwwjobshareukcom advertises seniorlevel parttime jobshare and interim roles via a specialist jobs board and allows people to search for jobshare partners tips from jobsharers before applying for a jobshare make sure you share the same values its great to have different styles and play to each others strengths but it wouldnt be ok to have different values says samia al qadhi i dont think having the same style is critical but i do think having similar values and commitment is make sure you trust each other trust is very important says simon toseland i know someone who did a jobshare who worked with a person who relied on them to do the majority of the work and thats not a good situation show employers what you have to offer together we did a joint letter of application and sent individual cvs and a joint cv and set out how we would do the job together says carey oppenheim once youve got it ensure you show a united front we dont have lots of disagreements says oppenheim but it is really important that you dont allow people to play you off against each other have your discussions in private and then have one voice externally ensure you continue to develop as an individual you need to make sure that you dont just play to each others strengths and not develop as an individual so you have to deliberately ensure you both have the opportunity to do every part of the job says lisa harker dont work every day its really tempting to continue to work the other two days and you have to really force yourself not to says oppenheim both lisa and i need to learn to contain the work to our three days and that is challenging talk to each other you need effective communication good handovers and admin systems that mean people dont have to tell you both the same thing says al qadhi a good team around you is also important a key thing is having a really strong pa who can share information between you adds al qadhi it would be really challenging if our pa wanted to jobshare,2007-10,carey oppenheim ha working

five highestprofile charities there are no gender differences in pay at the top and evidence shows the voluntary sector promotes female managers faster than their male counterparts perhaps ambitious altruistic women can finally put all their energies into the job in hand rather than having to beat against the glass ceiling as almost half of all charity chief executives are female what makes the voluntary sector such a good place for women the rspcas chief executive jackie ballard who recently announced she is leaving to run the royal national institute for deaf and hard of hearing people rnid says the influx of women into senior roles is partly the result of more modern recruitment methods selection panels have got out of the mindset of wanting a man and towards having a list of required qualities then they suddenly discover that hey women can fit that list charities are also having to be more commercial and collaborative in their search for funds she says theres nothing hard and fast about this but it may be that women are more able to combine the two at save the children chief executive jasmine whitbread says the simple fact that a significant number of women are running charities means its no longer regarded by trustees as unusual for females to aspire to a highpowered role its created a degree of momentum and id say there is now an equal balance of women and men who actually want those top jobs its become more normal so women arent having to break that mould but because charities will never be able to compete on pay the sector has had to think creatively about recruitment and retention save the children recently won the guardians best in sector award for supporting working parents and whitbread notes that anyone having a baby in her organisation will benefit from maternity conditions that go further than the statutory minimum she has also recently had to cut flexible working deals with people she wanted to recruit to her senior management team support for flexible working should come from the top she says firmly for instance i dont feel i have to hide the fact that im picking up my daughter and her friend from school when my peer in another organisation rings me and theres chatter and noise going on i think its important to show being familyfriendly works this attitude is important because clearly when being considered for a senior management position a woman will have to demonstrate she has built up sufficient experience to fit the role this frequently catches women out because having babies equals time off if its then made awkward to return at middle or senior management level capable and talented women in their late s and s wont be getting that experience but the capacity to work around family needs in the way save the children does may only be possible for big charities with large incomes and lots of staff charities generally did poorly in comparison to the public and private sectors in the guardians recent survey of britains best familyfriendly employers though fiona reynolds now director general of the national trust had her three children while at the campaign for the protection of rural england whose informal but enlightened approach ensured she could fit family commitments around work she does not believe most charities will be able to offer cuttingedge maternity or flexible working policies they simply cant afford it sacrifices whitbread also believes the sector appeals to women who having reached a senior stage in their career feel the sacrifices theyre making should go to something more worthy than hitting yearly financial targets make no mistake it certainly does eat into your private life she says and thats no small thing it may be that in business a woman reaches a senior stage in her career and asks herself is this encroachment on my private time worth it to me or is it just about making shareholders richer working in the charity sector answers that question because doing this job is about something more much is made of whether women have a more nurturing empathic approach to management and whether this might be more suitable to working in the voluntary sector reynolds suggests a softer less macho approach often fits with the core philosophies and aims of charitable organisations and because of this women might feel their values and skills are more valued this vindication might then allow them to thrive professionally there is a clearly a notion that the private sector is a more cutthroat competitive environment says reynolds there is a feeling that this may not only discriminate against women but also not appeal to women because the charity sector is a more fluid place to work and moreover does not usually have the budgets to constantly recruit externally it can provide talented people with the chance to explore a wide range of interesting challenging areas in their work i do think theres a meritocracy operating in the sector she says its a

one in seven children are unable to write their own name or recite the letters of the alphabet by the age of five according to government figures the results based on teachers observations of more

from memory there were who struggled to write letters to father christmas or a simple shopping list the foundation stage profile as the assessment is known shows how children are developing the skills expected of fiveyearolds after their reception year the assessments by the department for children schools and families revealed that children in the poorest areas fell behind students in more affluent areas in communication and social skills the findings will prompt a reevaluation of the effectiveness of government initiatives such as sure start to boost the development of children under

the guardian reported conservative claims that lone parents are currently favoured in the tax and benefit system focus on couples with children and firsttime buyers in tax plans october and days later you cited figures from the office for national statistics showing an increase in the total number of families headed by a lone parent marriage still the best way to play happy healthy families says study october but more interestingly while as the latter piece states that in the decade before the number of lone mothers had increased by to million the proportion of families headed by a lone parent has barely changed over the past years increasing by less than evidence that the tax and benefit system or the couple penalty referred to in the first article is driving people to live apart seems distinctly lacking this would be obvious to the lone parents who call our helpline each year they know that children who grow up in loneparent families face twice the risk of poverty as those who live with two parents together indeed many of the poorer health outcomes reported for lone parents and their children more likely to develop longterm illnesses may well be explained by their poor financial situation which was not researched we know that poverty has a clear independent effect on childrens outcomes we dont know the same for lone parenthood but most lone parents have been married and the proportion of births which are registered to only one parent is declining the stereotypical teenage mother on benefits recedes further into the distance when you consider that only of lone mothers are in fact teenagers their average age is and despite still facing a lack of affordable childcare flexible hours and appropriate training nearly are now in paid work so the idea that we are seeing a huge rise in family breakdown or a loneparent nation as your later report put it all fuelled by the tax and benefit system perhaps owes more to political expediency than to the facts next week sees the opening of an exhibition on lone parenthood at the womens library as it shows lone parenthood is not a recent phenomenon in the th century lone parents headed around the same proportion of families as today viewed as unfortunates after both wars the s saw a move towards a view of unmarried mothers as damaged and the s a move towards talk of an underclass misleading suggestions that lone parents are favoured by the tax and benefit system could lead to cuts in these benefits despite all the evidence that tackling poverty in loneparent families will be vital if the government is to meet its ambitious childpoverty target and these distortions also matter because they help to create prejudice which affects peoples everyday lives as one lone parent told us in recent research youre

more than a quarter of families are being charged for nursery places that are supposed to be free for three and fouryearolds according to a report today which highlights the continuing struggle that parents face to find suitable childcare the study by the daycare trust analysing years of childcare policy under labour reveals key gaps in the free entitlement to parttime early years education which was meant to be universally available in england by figures from the governments parents survey show of families whose children were using all or even only some of the hours a week free entitlement were still paying a fee for it the report reveals researchers found parents paid for example if they wanted the care over two days to suit work requirements rather than five short sessions which many parents cannot match with working hours meanwhile some parents are being asked to pay up to a term for extras such as lunch and trips in a move many see as a backdoor fee now that the government has banned the levying of topup charges to subsidise the free entitlement nurseries argue they cannot provide the quality of care and education required on the public funding they receive and some say they may no longer be viable now they cannot charge topup fees funding is set by councils and varies but can range from a child for each hour session in some areas to in others the childcare minister beverley hughes last night argued that the funding totalling bn a year for the free entitlement was sufficient and warned nurseries that topup fees could put off the poorest families from accessing free care and create a twotier early education system the evidence that charges are still being levied nevertheless raises a question mark over government claims that universal parttime free early years education was achieved for all fouryearolds in england in and threeyearolds in the report published with the national centre for social research also finds that while takeup of the free entitlement has been widespread it is the poorest families whose children may most benefit from high quality early years education who are still missing out a tenth of those in nonworking or lowincome families are failing to get the free places the study says that despite controversy on fees the big expansion of early years education has generally worked well but working parents still face significant barriers in years the government has deliberately shifted childcare from a private matter to a government investment programme but parents still face high costs and options that do not fit in with the hours they work according to the report daycare trust joint chief executive emma knights said the pattern of childcare use for working parents has barely changed in years the continuing cost barriers faced by parents raise questions about the markets ability to respond to parents diverse needs particularly for care at atypical hours during school holidays and flexible care as well as cost barriers the report identified a mismatch between supply and demand with parents patching together formal and informal childcare to cover their working hours the study points to evidence that high quality early years education can boost childrens achievement through primary school but also calls for more research into evidence that many hours of group care can create emotional and behavioural problems for very young children,2007-10,quarter family charged nursery place supposed free three fouryearolds according report today highlight continuing struggle parent face find

you women have never had it so good grumbled a male colleague of mine last week on the surface youd think he had a point girls are doing better than boys at school more women graduates are entering the medical and legal professions and maternity pay and childcare are better than ever before but were in danger of being lulled into a false sense of security progress on womens equality is at greater risk now than at any time in the last years there are four main threats beginning with the first woman syndrome one or two women in high profile leadership positions think jacqui smith or rebekah wade leads people to believe the glass ceiling has been broken this simply isnt the case evidence presented at a recent salzburg global seminar showed the number of women in senior positions in business and politics has hit a plateau in countries like the uk and us and may be declining for the vast majority of ordinary women balancing work and family life remains a constant struggle even women who believe theyve never experienced discrimination at work tell a different story once theyve had kids the second threat is the pipeline myth that because more women are entering the professions they will automatically work their way into senior positions if thats what they choose yet the evidence suggests a wait and see approach this doesnt work action must be taken to ensure women have equal opportunities to fulfil their potential and genuine choices about their careers the third threat comes from the way issues like flexible working and childcare have been pigeon holed as womens concerns feminists have rightly argued women carry most responsibility for bringing up children yet until balancing work and family life is seen as much a mans as a womans concern real equality will never be achieved this requires a very different framing of the debate surveys show nine out of teenagers now cite celebrities as their role models and women in their s and s are driving a staggering increase in spending on cosmetic surgery up last year to an estimated m so the final and possibly biggest threat to female equality is our celebritysodden culture which is slowly poisoning younger women into believing what they look like and who they marry is the key to getting on in life not what skills or talent they have to offer tackling these issues wont be easy but countries like norway are making a start to deliver change from the bottom up six out of months parental leave must be taken by the father or the family forfeits it to deliver pdf change from the top down new legislation requires of board positions on publicly listed companies to be held by women by january or the company could be fined or delisted these policies help men and women share family

the phrase speaking truth to power is probably one of most common quotes cited by comment is free posters ad hominem and godwins law not withstanding praise is heaped by the bucketload upon anyone who is prepared to stick their head above the parapet and tell those in authority how it really is as long as everyone is comfortable with the message of course the enduring power imbalance between the genders means that more often than not when women speak truth to power it is men we are confronting and as the reaction to julie bindels blog on friday illustrates our message is not as welcome on cif or indeed across the blogsphere as that of our male counterparts at the first mention of male violence for instance the worldwide web rings with the sound of men protesting their innocence why are you smearing us all with the same brush they cry ive never raised a hand to a woman and i never will raise one and yet try as i may no matter how many times i read the blog i cant see a single instance where julie suggested they all did i watched the blog unfold over friday afternoon and even i was shocked by the amount of vitriol aimed at the author as a woman who has been posting and commenting on cif for over a year i thought i had become inured to the sexism by now but even i wasnt prepared for this i was relieved when the blog was closed to comments for the night although plenty of others werent but if posters are prepared to do nothing but throw abuse at an author what right have they to complain when the moderators step in im not here to ask for special treatment for women bloggers although i have no doubt ill be accused of wanting just that nor am i asking for positive discrimination or any of the other special measures socalled minority groups are condemned for supporting what i am doing is pointing out the effect of the almost constant mobbing that women writers endure when they dare to pen articles that tackle important womens issues when they dare to challenge the existing status quo and when they start to ask uncomfortable questions of those who still wield the power across the globe as kathy sierra discovered to her cost when a woman steps onto the net shed better be prepared for the inevitable shit storm that will follow and thats even if the subject isnt controversial sierra was forced into hiding after receiving online death threats from anonymous abusers while other feminist bloggers have been forced to either close down their sites or endure a relentless bombardment of vile and misogynistic messages since i began writing for cif ive already had my name linked to a pornographic website and ive also been subjected to online abuse from men who have taken issue with my articles classic narrow slitty bitter sly looking eyes short hair mannish looking always always hate men has she never felt like hitting someone her girlfriend has she hit her girlfriend the above comment was posted one charmer over at the deceptively named antimisandrycom when i wrote about domestic violence another poster suggested an ingenious solution for sorting out the feminists put them all together in a fucking room with those they are moaning about and it will be no surprise to see that they will be ripped to shreds limb by limb nice ive spoken to women who have told me i always read the blogs but id never start commenting on them theres too much hatred for women out there is it really any wonder that women are so reluctant to contribute when all we get for our pains are campaigns of harassment and intimidation if we mention sexism were inundated with instructions on how we should lighten up and quit being so humourless radical and divisive mention violence against women and despite all the evidence we can muster we are inundated with posters desperate to prove that women are in fact the more violent sex try and be lighthearted and were accused of being emptyheaded and trivial and try and tackle science and we are accused of not understanding the subject so what exactly do you want us to talk about after years of male domination on the web things are starting to look up according to recent research there are now more women online than ever before taking up more computer time than men so im sorry mrpikebishop and others i know you would prefer it if ideology driven feminised pressure groups would just shut up but it aint going to happen we have found our voice and whether men on the blogs like it or not we are here to stay,2007-11,phrase speaking truth power probably one common quote cited comment free poster ad

my dear friend and colleague gillian gibbons is the head of key stage one and teacher of class x at unity high school khartoum gillian joined the school in august after a long and highly respected career as a teacher and local education authority inspector in liverpool uk in late august or early september of this year gillian came into possession of a teddy bear a gift from a parent an early years activity designed to encourage in particular achievement in literacy skills plays out around a class teddy he does the rounds of the children going home with them just in case the child concerned writes a diary entry for the teddy about his visit to the childs home this was gillians intention and it is in line with our whole school plan to raise literacy skills a target especially pertinent as the overwhelming majority of our pupils are of english as another language eal status in line with this the first task was to give the teddy a name gillian wanted to call the bear faris in honour of my new son now we all wish she had gone with this first idea but excellent teacher that she is she chose instead to ask the children what they wanted to call the teddy the children voted and chose the name muhammad all but one of the children in her class are muslims gillian then wrote a letter to the parents of class x explaining that the children had chosen the name muhammad for their class teddy bear not one parent raised any objection since late september the teddy has been visiting many of the children of class xs homes three of the parents are teachers in the school we became aware of this issue a few weeks ago we suggested to gillian that it was inappropriate that the teddy bear was called muhammad as this might offend cultural sensibilities the school issued a letter to parents to say that the teddy bear was tired of visiting so many homes and his friend another stuffed toy called something entirely inoffensive would be visiting instead the islamiyat department in our school was consulted and they suggested that this should resolve any potential problems however on sunday the school was visited by officers of the ministry of education our school director robert boulos was interviewed at length by these officials the government officers declared themselves unsatisfied with his responses the government men then asked to see and interview gillian gillian gave exactly the same report of her actions again the men from the ministry found this unacceptable and demanded that gillian present herself at the police barracks on arrival at the police barracks accompanied by the school principal gillian was interrogated for five hours gillian was then remanded to the cells early yesterday morning i was informed that gillian had been charged under the sudanese penal code with blasphemously defaming the prophet an offence that is incredible serious here having consulted with a number of religious muslim people hereabouts all are of the opinion that gillians offence if it may be described as such was to inadvertently offend religious sensibilities by allowing the children to name the teddy bear with the same name as the prophet as this was not done maliciously or with deliberate intent they are puzzled about why gillian has been detained all our parents both muslim and coptic christian have stepped forward to offer their support and the parents of gillians class have gone on record to assert that they never had any objection to the name of the teddy bear i reiterate the vast majority of these parents are themselves muslims the school is now closed for at least the next week this was the suggestion of the ministry of education we have been provisioned with extra security around the school school names have been removed from our transports the risk of attack against school property and staff has become a concern now perhaps gillian was foolish not to have taken advice when the teddy bear was named however her intention was clearly not to insult the religious sensibilities of anyone and she certainly did not upset anyone in the school or any of the parents we are all deeply concerned for gillian who is not half as tough as she likes to make out she is alone effectively being held in solitary confinement she does not speak arabic and the police staff where she was held until tuesday morning did not speak

to some feminist activism seems old hat one of my friends who has been involved in the womens liberation movement for as long as i have sneered at me when i asked her if she was coming on this saturdays reclaim the night march through london the inference was that she had something better to do well there is nothing better i can think of to do on saturday if you are planning to watch x factor instead of marching alongside your sisters chanting fabulous slogans such as men off the streets and yes means yes and no means no consider this without feminist activism rape in marriage would be legal it would be perfectly acceptable to pay women less than men for the same job and sack them when pregnant and domestic violence would be considered a normal part of family life while you open that bottle of wine and put your feet up more than two thousand of us will be protesting about the atrocities inflicted on women by men and telling men they will not continue to get away with it although it is fashionable to look down on what is thought to be oldfashioned feminism doing direct action naming men as the problem criticising rather than embracing the sex industry women need to be out on the streets protesting about sexual violence more than ever despite four decades of campaigning against domestic violence over women are still killed every year by current and former partners more rapes than ever are reported but far fewer convicted than the s and the sex industry is growing at an alarming rate globally there are so few convictions for child sexual abuse it may as well be legal to rape an underfive year old and sexual harassment in the workplace is still a major problem for women i could go on male violence towards women and children yes male is pandemic we must force them to change to stop raping killing and abusing us when i march on saturday i will be doing so for women everywhere even those of you watching x factor because sexual violence is the only thing in the world that affects all women and therefore working towards eliminating it should be something we are all involved in before you start having a go telling me you have not been raped or beaten by your partner or sexually abused or flashed let me ask you women something can you honestly say hand on heart that you have never feared rape have you never modified your behaviour even just a little for fear of being attacked remember that time you took a minicab home alone and drunk did you feel relieved the next day that nothing bad happened to you or when you walked through a park late at night alone all women know that if we have not been raped we are lucky we are so accustomed to living with the constant nagging fear of sexual violence that we rarely notice it is there half the time so let us stop ignoring the obvious until we all stand up together and make ourselves visible in the struggle against male violence they will continue to rape beat and abuse us lets see you there on saturday and men if you wish to be part of the solution rather than the problem perhaps you could send the organisers a donation for next years march something tells me we will not have a world free of sexual violence by next november,2007-11,feminist activism seems old hat one friend ha involved womens liberation movement long sneered asked wa coming saturday reclaim night march london inference

parents feel intense pressure to read to their children and help them with their schoolwork but struggle to find the time according to a report it suggests that they should instead be protecting play time from an encroaching scholarisation of childhood the research which will become part of the cambridge university primary review says drives to encourage parents to get more involved in their childs education which are likely to be a focus of the year childrens plan which ministers are preparing to deliver next month could backfire some parents are intimidated by academia while others feel guilty for failing to live up to expectations according to indepth research published as part of the biggest review of primary education in years while parents often welcome advice as to how to help their children with schoolfocused work too high an expectation of what is achievable can lead to pressure and guilt for some and resentment for others neither emotion is likely to enhance the relationships between parents and their childrens teachers many children feel protective towards their free time it says the scholarisation of childhood presents parents with dilemmas how far to protect children from its incursions and how far to help them engage with its agendas parents have an important function in helping their children to have some free time the researchers argue that the extension of breakfast clubs and afterschool clubs sold by the government as wraparound care for busy parents can increase the pressures on children schools find it increasingly difficult to talk to parents as family structures have shifted children may be living in two places over the week with different sets of siblings both birth and step in each schools in such circumstances may find it difficult to know which parent is the first point of contact one report says the research says that many parents in one study said they felt uncomfortable about taking on a teaching role and were concerned about importing the classroom into the home as a result of their children doing more schoolwork on computers todays reports are four of which are being released this winter they will inform

has been a busy year for the department for work and pensions it has seen the passing of an act of parliament a controversial report on welfare reform a number of welfare to work initiatives a new ministerial team and now a welfare reform green paper consultation on which closed this month much of the departments recent focus and the criticism levelled back at it is around proposals to increase the requirements on lone parents to look for work but one does wonder why so much political debate has focused on this issue if the government requires lone parents to seek work when their youngest child is seven over time nearly of lone parents on benefits would be affected according to governments own figures there are lone parents on benefits these proposals would affect at a time when there are nearly jobseekers allowance claimants and m people on incapacity benefit even when we look at the governments desire to end child poverty by it seems targeting lone parents will not have an overwhelming effect only of children living in poverty are in workless lone parent households if crudely speaking of these households are affected by increased conditionality and it is effective we are still only looking at impacting on less than of children living in poverty while these figures are not insignificant they are small compared to the overall challenge ahead indeed if we are to make serious inroads into reducing welfare dependency and child poverty the focus must shift to the issue of how we can best support people to find sustain and progress in work both the new deal and employment zones have had notable success however the challenge we now face is to support those the new deal failed to reach those deemed the hardest to help we at working links know from our seven years experience of working with this group that the best way to help disadvantaged people enter the labour market is to offer support right for them as an individual this must be coupled with a holistic approach looking at the needs of the individual their family and the wider community we have found for example that if a person lives in a workless household their chances of finding and sustaining a job are greatly increased if other members of their household are also supported into work on a community level what is needed is local knowledge and insight services must be more accessible we talk of people being hard to help when often it is the services that are hard to access looking at the needs of the community must include working with local employers to address skills gaps and considering issues such as childcare housing and health for such an approach to be effective it must be supported by a genuine commitment to joinedup working people are complex and the issues they face do not fit neatly into the remit of any one government department if we are to make real progress it is on these issues that the debate should focus we should not underestimate the challenge with which we are faced a person in receipt of incapacity benefit for two years is more likely to retire or die than find work unemployment or economic inactivity is often entrenched and passed from generation to generation however neither should the imperatives for acting be underestimated the gains to the individual community and wider society are huge and far reaching fiscal savings lower crime levels reduction of poverty increased self esteem improved health the dividing lines between the three main political parties on this issue are slim if we are to succeed we must move the debate on we must act now not only for the benefits this will have to the lives of those individuals but also to ensure that as a nation we are ready to face the challenges ahead there are real incentives for being bold and radical we are faced with an opportunity to make a difference to people living in poverty by helping them and their families to find retain and progress in work if we are to succeed

my generation according to the sunday times is the first generation to be raised free of the shackles of feminism and were uninterested in our foremothers who unglamorously tied themselves to railings threw themselves under horses and with hairy pits and split ends banged on and on and on about a womans need for equality were all postfeminist now cute norwegian popstrel ida maria was drafted in to

its great to be a girl this is not the sort of thing women were allowed to do prefeminism as julie burchill once said there is a short and sharp way to deal with women who say they are not feminists if a woman answers no to the question are you a feminist she should immediately be stripped of her voting rights her right to institute divorce her legal protection from domestic violence and marital rape oh and her pay should be cut to less than that of her male colleagues then she could lead the carefree nonballbreaking life she so desires and not be forced to take advantage of all those unpleasant and exhausting social gains which those nasty butch feminists in the th century forced on her or maybe geri amp co should just hotfoot it out to say saudi arabia wander about in a postfeminist manner and try to emerge with their postfeminist notions intact when there are women living in the world today swathed head to toe in black cloth when its degrees and counting when women are held to be the property of their husbands and can be beaten to within an inch of their lives with impunity when young women in africa are circumcised by village elders when women can be stoned to death for adultery when they arent allowed to drive cars have no right to an education let alone a career and when they are not even allowed to vote its ridiculous to say youre not a feminist lesbian or straight bra burning or bra wearing there cant be a young woman among us who doesnt work herself up into a fury just thinking about it we may have won the battle here but we havent won the war

teams of workers come up with the most innovative ideas if they are made up of even proportions of men and women according to researchers a study published yesterday by the london business school found that professional teams with an equal gender split were much more likely to experiment share knowledge and fulfil tasks regardless of whether the team leader was a man or a woman an even mix allowed a psychological safe communication climate and selfconfidence among members which in turn provided fertile ground for innovation says the report from the schools lehman brothers centre for women in business more than teams of knowledge workers at companies across countries were surveyed the report concludes that teams work best with an even mix because individuals tend to contribute less fully and confidently if they are in a minority this applies to men as much as women according to lynda gratton professor at the centre and lead author of the study she said it is not about gender it is about minorities our data shows that whenever anybody is in a minority they suffer and as a consequence the team suffers however the research also found that gender differences could have an influence on team performance because male and female workers may have very different lives outside work what the report calls spillover from home influences an individuals performance which in turn affects their team says the study team members generally experience positive spillover in which positive feelings about home life also enrich their work but men in particular find stress at home carrying into work and vice versa professor gratton said team leaders who are women have already often made the decision to make their home life easier by having one child early or not having children at all men have not made that choice and it is men who are trying to have it all work and home and they cant because they suffer this idea that women think they can have it all is nonsense they know exactly what sacrifices they have to make women team leaders are also six times more likely to carry the domestic burden than their male peers according to the research the study recommends that organisations should encourage shared domestic labour by reinforcing family friendly policies and should actively manage spillover by reducing the pressure on workers to work long hours meanwhile a report from the chartered management institute which represents managers found of the senior managers and directors surveyed often find it hard to get home on time and only one in strongly agree they

back in the early s when i first became involved in feminist politics it was customary for many men on the left and some women too to accuse feminism of being a bourgeois reactionary movement composed of middle class women whose agenda was to split the working class and destroy socialism womens rights they confidently predicted would be taken care of by socialism itself after the revolution when women had finished making the tea these laughable contortions seem quaint now but are being faithfully replicated on this site by supporters of salam almahadins contention that the western demand for equality for women the application of universal human rights is no more than an arm of western imperialism masquerading under progressive politics the forthcoming revolution excused everything years ago there was only one place for women in the black panther movement semijoked eldridge cleaver and that was prone in the minds of many on the left the role of feminism was to dissipate the clear thrust of political debate muddying the clear sharp lines of the class struggle with bleating about the personal being political what we understand today as secondwave feminism had its origins as a movement rather than a set of ideas which preceded organised action in the antiwar protests apart from a few high profile activists like angela davis womens job in the movement was to make the coffee and provide horizontal stress relief pussy power was the first derogatory term for feminism the far left flirted with it and then withdrew in horror as it recognised its potency its capacity for inculcating independent thought and heretical ideas in britain the socialist workers party briefly ran a standalone magazine called womens voice which the top cadre decided unilaterally to close down feminism has been the most successful political revolution of the th century its impact as farreaching as the antislavery campaigns of the previous one it has transformed everything it touched michael rosen writing in the comments on almahadins piece says we should take the mote out of our own eye before criticising other cultures for their want of womens rights for in britain domestic violence is still deemed ok he writes feminism he believes begins to look as if its a moral hammer being used in the service of a wider effort to to be crude to keep control of an area of the globe in order that we in the west can keep control of its resources if domestic violence is less ok than it was years ago it is because feminists ignored the clamorous cries of men on the left who told them that they should be building the class struggle not womens refuges the feminists who were condemned for dissipating revolutionary socialism and the struggles of the unions were responsible for creating rape crisis centres and organising take back the night marches i was there we did it even though we were harangued and told that working class women needed class equality then gender equality would follow in the fullness of time and that we were doing the ruling classs work for it dividing men against women feminists ignored the advice and carried on anyway nor are we likely to accept now the excuse that we cannot speak out against the apartheid that exists against women in saudi arabia because as our ostensible ally in the war against terror we are aiding colonialism the rhetoric changes its

last month i wrote an article for cif scoffing at the idea that women of my generation are denigrating feminism feminism if you look it up in the dictionary is a doctrine that advocates equal rights for women and youd merit a stiletto to the head if you didnt believe in that but this week feminists intent on flogging books to daily mail readers have come out to demonstrate in glorious technicolour exactly why young women think feminism isnt for them the american feminist carol liebau has written a book prude how the sexobsessed culture damages girls which argues that the young women of today are more focused on being sexy than being clever and that they compete for attention on the basis of how much theyre prepared to do sexually for boys this follows closely on from last years feminist meditation on young women ariel levys female chauvinist pigs which argued that a raunch culture grips society making women compete to look like slags and sluts if anyones engaged in activities regressive to feminism its women labelling their younger sisters slags and sluts its like older black people going around denouncing the young black people of today as obsessed with competing to be niggers i dont know whats going on in america possibly the womenfolk there are engaged in a neverending episode of girls gone wild with a soundtrack of christina aguilera wailing about how she wants to get dirrty and where sex education classes consist of watching sharon stone movies because thats what male society expects of them but i doubt it and although the examples liebau digs up about how sexual paraphernalia is introduced into the lives of young girls sounds like the stuff of hammer horror thongs for preteens with miniature pole dancing kits this doesnt mean that dressing up in a boob tube as a teenager means youre not interested in being clever in britain at least girls are outperforming boys in the classroom year on year they will go into the professions in evergreater numbers and meanwhile they are also having sex wearing thongs bleaching their hair piercing their belly buttons downing alcopops and dancing provocatively in things called nightclubs and they are enjoying it i probably waste too much time myself for ariel levy and co painting my nails dyeing my hair dousing on perfume going to pilates classes buying lingerie plastering on eyeliner and drinking cider with boys but i do it because i like it not because i feel i must and i struggle to find myself a disgrace to womankind as a result feminists seem to be arguing that young women have taken sexual liberation past the bounds of decency and shunted their demands for everything else but this isnt true young girls expect to be equal to men even to dominate their men and they dont bang on about it because they cannot remember a time when it was not so what has changed is the ageing feminists attitude to sex whereas once they sought to make sex equally a womans domain now that they have stopped having it they look at the young women seeking it and are appalled dressing sexy is wrong liebau has a problem with sex education because it starts from the assumption that all teenagers are having sex already not that they should abstain but this is getting into catholic church territory formerly the feminists enemy now apparently the feminists sexual mentor sex outside marriage is damaging to a womans psyche they claim but sex is only damaging if it is seen as an unnatural and perverse act for consenting young people its the most perfectly natural act no matter how theyre dressed before they get down to it it seems downright grubby that pioneering feminists like rosie boycott and fay weldon are pouncing on liebaus book to trash the current generation as irresponsible slags and binge drinkers only interested in a grope and vomit instead of the sisterhood sticking together theyve become demented pelicans turning on their young and so it seems only appropriate to quote that other great feminist julie burchill who claims that all this sniping comes from a voluntary amnesia about their own youthful urges when the nipples go south the nose goes north and old girls who used to be able to get their kit off without frightening the horses will inevitably look down their snouts at women who still can the sisterhood does not shackle the young women of today but its doing a pretty good job of grabbing us by the hair and giving a damn good kicking,2007-12,last month wrote article cif scoffing idea woman generation denigrating feminism feminism look dictionary

lone parents will be expected to be available for parttime work once their child reaches primary school and fulltime work when the child is in secondary school the conservatives said yesterday as they moved to outbid labour on welfare reform before a commons statement today by peter hain the work and pensions secretary on government plans to get lone parents back to work his tory shadow chris grayling offered a taster of his partys own green paper on welfare reform to be unveiled next month it will build on proposals from the partys social justice policy group led by former leader iain duncan smith we will be tough on those who are reluctant to start working to get back into work grayling said in a speech to the policy exchange thinktank we will expect single parents who can work to start doing so as their children get older a primary school parent should be willing to work parttime a secondary school parent should be willing to work fulltime its the right thing for them and for their children all the evidence shows that getting a household off benefit dependency is ultimately good for parents and children alike grayling told the guardian that this would not mean for instance requiring lone parents to take fulltime nightshift work but the conservatives go further than the plans ministers have so far outlined the governments green paper in july proposed requiring lone parents to seek work once their children reach from and seven from but this can be parttime work kate bell head of policy at the pressure group one parent familiesgingerbread said relying on a punitive approach which has been shown to damage child wellbeing casts serious doubts on the conservatives commitment to ending child poverty most lone parents are already working and most of those who are not cant find childcare or jobs that fit with school hours or have good reasons for prioritising their parenting responsibilities danny alexander the liberal democrats work and pensions

never mind the party political reaction even within cif the jury is still out on the governments childrens plan announced yesterday yvonne roberts says it has ducked the issue of creating a properly qualified teaching and childcare workforce while jenni russell worries about yet more halfbaked initiatives overloading schools by sheer coincidence i happened to be in the house of commons yesterday when childrens secretary ed balls was making his statement watching him speak on a tv monitor in a committee room with a group of childrens play activists and advocates i am not ashamed to say that we cheered when we realised that as far as we were concerned he had saved the best for last m of government funding for improving outdoor play opportunities this announcement is the first time in living memory that whitehall has invested meaningfully in play for plays sake it marks a decisive break from the unhealthy trend among policy makers to schoolify almost every aspect of childrens lives a tendency that in their cif pieces yesterday both roberts and russell left unchallenged by contrast teacher and cif contributer oli de botton applauded the plan for looking beyond the school at children in the round what is more the level of financial commitment is striking it represents nearly a quarter of all the new money at the secretary of states disposal a dramatic shift in emphasis from a politician who only months ago said that schools are at the centre of delivery it should fund improvements in every local authority alongside the creation of new staffed adventure playgrounds innovative approaches in pathfinder areas and high quality training for playworkers the childrens plan recognises that children should as demos argues be seen and heard not reared in captivity just like previous generations they need a degree of freedom to be active and visible in streets parks and neighbourhoods in achieving this goal it commits government to nothing less than a national play strategy while this might sound like an empty piece of ministerial policyspeak a strategy is in fact crucial to getting the key government departments and agencies to work together the plan itself has started this process it announced a review of statutory planning guidance which will perhaps make for some lively conversations across the balls family breakfast table alongside training for planners highways officers and green space managers on creating more childfriendly public space in its support for mph zones and playfriendly home zones the plan sends a clear message that transport policy has to start taking childrens needs more seriously balls prominent criticism of this countrys corrosive no ball games here culture showed political bravery as well as moral leadership of course yesterdays announcement leaves some questions unanswered like roberts i worry about the figures while m sounds like a lot it is not enough to make up for decades of underinvestment though the pathfinder approach should help to secure longerterm financial support more seriously there is tension between the positive vision of childrens competences the plan implies and some of the excessively riskaverse measures brought forward by government in recent years as i argue in my book no fear its policies on both antisocial behaviour and safeguarding urgently need to be rethought if not they will undermine the goal of creating a society where young and old are more at ease with each other it is also crazy that the government is spending billions on building thousands of new schools yet has given no real thought to allowing local children to use the playgrounds of those schools in the evenings at the weekends and during the holidays of course school playgrounds are not every childs ideal play space but where i live in east london it is common to see boys risking life and limb climbing over increasingly high fences to enjoy that most simple of pleasures a kickabout with their mates opening up school grounds also makes sense in rural areas where whatever citydwellers might think the shortfall of outdoor space for play can be especially acute these are not minor quibbles but they should not take away from the significance of this announcement the unicef report on childrens wellbeing which saw the uk placed bottom of a league table of developed nations has forced politicians of all stripes to look anew at the whole of childrens lives i have contributed to this debate as an unpaid adviser to the tory childhood review led by david willetts it was inevitable that the childrens plan would provoke a mixed response all i can say is that as someone who has spent most of my professional life making the public policy case for childrens play and free time yesterday was a landmark occasion the plan gives fitting if overdue recognition that for children the act of playing is a not just a vital developmental process but also an aspect of childhood that merits sustained state intervention

welcome to the wrap its childs play for ed balls ed balls the secretary of state for children schools and families has announced a new government initiative intended to allow young children to play more he will jettison the no ball games culture of the past with the government to spend bn on reversing the decline of childhood the plan involves the building of adventure parks and state of the art youth centres over the next three years and will also crack down on bad teachers children born in the summer proven to struggle academically will be allowed to start school a year later playasulearn says the sun britain is seen by the un as one of the worst places in the civilised world to bring up children the paper adds the uk has crashed down the global league table for literacy and numeracy bad teachers are not rare there are at least of them no one has ever been sacked for incompetence until they are removed mr balls grand designs can never be accomplished the mail however is less impressed overall the plan has a gimmicky and hollow ring a national play strategy social and health workers on school sites advice services for parents on areas such as housing benefits and parent skills all smack of top down government trying to make schools into family welfare centres and interfering too much in the deeply personal business of how we bring up our children helen rumbelow writing in the times thinks balls is starting too late study after study has shown that the most crucial time for a child is in its first year and earlier in the womb it barely matters what a nursery does compared to what a parent is by two its too late the telegraph reports that other parts of the strategy include proposals to grant teenage criminals an amnesty if they say sorry overall the paper isnt too thrilled by his announcement all work and no play makes ed balls a dull schools secretary again and again this master of the english language touched the heights of selfparody and finally mr speaker to help parents keep their children safe while playing outside i can also announce that we will launch a new national play strategy early next year plan to overhaul child development sun golden balls mail what our children need is an education telegraph ed balls unveils his strategy for fun times no ball games culture dropped in favour of playing outdoors brown to miss eu signing ceremony just when some would like the prime minister to be thinking about a late exit from europe theres a furore about a late entry a diary clash means he will be unable to attend thursdays main ceremony for the signing of the eu treaty because he also wants to be at the commons liaison committee what looks like a snub to europe is meant to be interpreted as respect for westminster so what have the diary secretaries managed to do about it the liaison committee has been brought forward by an hour and brown will arrive in lisbon late at some time during lunch missing the main ceremony the guardians front page has a senior eu diplomat saying that the pms dithering was the talk of last weekends euafrica summit to antieuropeans he has simply run away and accepted the signing of the treaty to proeuropeans he has simply refused to stand his ground and fight and for the rest he has opted out the diplomat adds the times says brown will sign the treaty on his own some time towards the end of lunch in the same room as the group ceremony with cameras present maybe that last bit should be rethought a picture of gbs europe of one might be something his aides should avoid the sun features the prime ministers signature and says two words that could change britain forever it is relatively unconcerned by his tardy arrival at the summit being much more worried that he is going to sign the document at all the paper adds that crafty germans are trying to shoehorn a european anthem into the treaty germany is leading a last minute call by countries for the treaty to include support for an eu flag and the euro currency as well as the song in a double page spread in the telegraph brown says he backs the idea of a national museum of history everywhere i go around the world i find men and women asking questions about britains history of achievement he explains the museum would be very much about britain and it isnt yet clear whether there would be a europe room brown will now go to lisbon and sign eu treaty but by himself times brown accused of lacking the guts to sign european reform treaty in public sun one day til brown sells us out telegraph brown why i support british

beginning of the th century the right to strike the mail reports that ten ministers are in revolt over the governments handling of the police pay row home affairs committee chairman keith vaz said ten ministers had told him of their concerns at the home office decision to stage this years police pay award mr vaz reported that police minister tony mcnulty had been surrounded by worried mps in the commons tearoom elsewhere the paper carries a story saying pen pusher police are spending more time on paperwork than they are on the beat michael white in the guardian asks who voters would back in a showdown between the police and government if it comes to that but he doesnt seem to think it will smith and her police minister were taken aback at the rank and file police anger over the m haircut which the government inflicted on the police they may come to regret it home counties mps such as labours martin salter who roughed up smith yesterday are also alarmed at their officers defecting to the met where they can earn an extra a year plus generous travel allowances ministers so far are unmoved insisting that recruitment and retention is not a problem after years of generous pay settlements no one expects the police to cause serious trouble david camerons team has muttered sympathetically in support of the boys in blue but not run amok some labour mps start to wonder if the

are evidence of a new alqaida front opening up in north africa a group calling itself alqaida in the islamic maghreb claimed responsibility for the two car bombings which killed up to people and hit algerias constitutional court and the office of the unhcr the un refugee agency until recently most violence in algeria was attributed to the gspc the salafist group for preaching and combat which generally targets the countrys regime and symbols not foreign interests sparking debate about whether the bombers had intended to hit the un offices the times says commentators saw the date december as a key signifier that the attacks were alqaida authored but the guardians leader warns against this analysts still debate whether this group the gspc has joined the ranks of global jihadists it says but it could equally be the case that that it suits the gspc to play the alqaida card as it does alqaida to confer its blessing on the algerian group knowing the enemy is the hard lesson of iraq and it has taught us to differentiate between insurgents and insurgencies if we do not we are condemned to make the same mistakes the telegraph is less cautious about the nuances of whether the gspc is alqaida or not the alqaida brand name brings glamour and a flow of recruits it says more importantly however it also brings a new definition of success previously the gspc was dedicated to overthrowing algerias secular regime under president abdelaziz bouteflika and installing a hardline islamist government its chances of achieving this were virtually zero having merged with alqaida however the gspc has acquired a new and far less demanding goal now the one and only aim is to execute attacks for their own sake especially against western interests the next logical step would be for the gspc to strike inside europe perhaps using cells in the algerian diaspora if so alqaida will have acquired a new ally for its war on the west death in algiers telegraph alqaidas link to

as jenni russell says good intentions arent enough to make ed balls year childrens plan a success although the department of children schools and families says it has looked at more than national and international research studies it seems to have avoided those that say bn over three years for such a range of aims isnt nearly enough the childrens plan is that every childcare setting should be led by a graduate or two graduates in deprived areas by thats a goal thats way too timid particularly when the intention is to offer free nursery places to poorer twoyearolds whom one hopes will be allowed to have fun while they slave away trying to catch up on their middleclass peers new zealand has been far more ambitious in it had at least one registered teacher in every childcare service by its on target to ensure that employed in a childcare setting has a teachers degree and the remaining are in training who pays the cost the government offers a subsidy the parents are not expected to fork out as they are here why do teachers matter because they are trained to look at the whole child to encourage his or her development through play socialising and learning appropriate to age recent ofsted reports said that of nursery schools with a teacher had an outstanding rating compared with only of full day care nurseries without a teacher why wont the government set a target cost is one the childrens plan price tag of bn sounds a great deal but in truth its the equivalent of peanuts on the plate of every child the childcare workforce is largely poorly trained and badly paid a teacher

parents helen penn professor of early childhood at the university of east london quotes research findings from the us that show nonprofit centres offered better quality care better educated staff and lower turnover in canada nonprofit provision is of higher quality than for profit by a margin of what ed balls should have done is to say we want a fully qualified childcare profession by these are subsidies and levers we are going to use to make it happen these are the reasons why it matters and this is what its going to cost instead we have a confetti storm of proposals clearly signalling that while government has mapped the terrain of how to achieve a new era for children by its drawn back from making an investment that will bring a proper return given the uncertain economic future it doesnt seem likely that extra funding is likely to come so is this a case of good intentions on the cheap or a blindness to the consequences yet again of initiating a huge change in childrens lives without sufficient consideration given to the price of getting it wrong would taxpayers foot the real bill the charity children has carefully costed the price of providing integrated services in line with those sketched out by ed balls but on a more ambitious scale the cost isnt bn over three years but bn a year bn of which is already paid by parents a far higher proportion than countries such as

theres a feeling here that we shouldnt seek publicity because wed be drawing attention to ourselves but its not about that its about drawing attention to the causes were working for and raising funds for all over the world says woodstockriley a lawyer in her late s soroptimists are trying to improve life for other women take thailand for example where they are supporting a scheme to offer vulnerable women scholarships to deter them from involvement in the sex industry or manchester where they have raised money for a project to support mothers whose lives have been affected by gun crime or sierra leone where they are supporting moves to set up small mothercentred houses for five or six children to remove them from the institutionalisation of orphanages woodstockriley feels that internationalism is one of the soroptimists strongest cards we have members in countries so we can swap ideas there are soroptimists worldwide with in the uk and woodstockriley is aiming to increase

based on the red books recording babies health there will also be a new parents panel to feed parents views into policy and a focus on play billed as the biggest by any government will see m spent over three years to allow up to playgrounds nationally to be rebuilt or renewed together with new adventure playgrounds for eight to yearolds in disadvantaged areas greater efforts will be made to reach out to the neediest families to support child carers and to provide disabled children with short breaks the government restates its commitment to eradicate child poverty by and promises to

performing teachers to be banned from teaching in the rare cases where a teachers competence is falling the plan says they should have their qualified teacher status removed there are moves to raise the skills of the entire teaching workforce with every new teacher undertaking a masters qualification at the beginning of their career as they work a m ma programme is promised plus expansion of an existing scheme to fasttrack potential headteachers testing the document gives the clearest signal that the government is committed to scrapping sats which it would replace with tests which pupils take when ready a pilot in schools could be extended in in a controversial experiment schools which are achieving the best results in the pilot are getting cash rewards a system of personal tutors will give pupils one member of staff who will know them in the round advising on behaviour and academic work and liaising with their parents before they start school some m will be targeted at getting

ed balls delivered a christmas hamper to the house of commons yesterday full of varied if familiar treats enough to cause indigestion if consumed at once that may be why his year childrens plan for england has been dribbled out across the media over recent days pulled together it offered a real taste of the brown government impressive in its interventionist ambition but leaving doubts about whether that ambition can ever be met the schools secretary announced reviews a batch of longterm targets and an awful lot of policies many already being tried out his plans leapt from zerocarbon schools to nursery care from language teaching to grants to disabled teenagers from behaviour monitors to mile per hour speed limits and from playgrounds to the problems of summer babies the uniting idea not always easy to discern was a good one it came from a recognition of reality since the causes of educational failure lie as much outside schools as inside them the solutions are to be found in more than one place as well mr balls spoke yesterday about childhood not just education governments have always found this idea difficult to grasp under tony blair there was a strong focus on what happened in the classroom driven by tests and targets mr balls looked beyond that yesterday attempting to engage parents with the support of welfare and health services working through schools he stuck with brownite determination to plans to cut child poverty and help disadvantaged children extending nursery care for twoyearolds though in a cashstrapped government this must be funded by limiting provision elsewhere he dared to venture into the cultural aspects of modern childhood rightly questioning the effects of rampant advertising early drinking and sexualisation he recognised that modern education brings its own pressures promising to ease them by allowing primaryschool children to take tests at more than one point in the year he found money for new play areas too and he promised to examine the english primaryschool curriculum emphasising basic skills examined individually each of these proposals has strengths though many are familiar the test for mr balls and the new department he heads will be to show that something greater can be created by bringing them together in one grand scheme his scattergun statement fired a lot of ideas into the sky but will not in itself ensure that britain becomes as he promised the best country in which to bring up children the public may ask why after a decade of greater spending and a succession of plans problems are as great as they are and why yesterdays proposals are the solution league tables can mislead and this years unicef report which put britain last out of countries for child welfare can be painted as out of date but past government schemes have often failed last month a report from lancaster university accused ministers of a substantial misallocation of public funds and suggested that better exam results have come from easier exams they may be wrong but both opposition parties are now offering a critique of topdown control in a speech last week nick clegg called for parents to start new schools outside the existing system that is a more diverse approach than mr balls offered yesterday and a sign of fading affection even among progressives for the possibilities of direct state action for a government that needs to move on from the disasters of the past month yesterdays statement brought some relief but like much else from the brown government the destination set is far away now the target for improved childhood homebuilding renewable energy worldclass skills and much else besides may be a year of miracles but voters will have to be persuaded to keep their eyes to the heavens

the broad intentions behind ed ballss new childrens plan are admirable he wants to give more children the opportunities experiences and support which are already available to those from betteroff homes all the research shows that the current education system entrenches a social disadvantage which is wellestablished by the age of three at that age bright but poor children have already fallen behind less clever middleclass children and the gulf grows with every passing year despite all the money and initiatives which have gone into education in the last decade so the plan is an attempt to bridge the many gaps in such childrens lives schools are to be encouraged to become the centres for many of the services that families might need from social and mental services to help with parenting or advice on benefits and housing they will be expected to offer before and afterschool activities so that all children have the chance to dance or act or take part in sports there will be hours a week of free nursery care for the poorest twoyearolds in the hope that this will offer the stimulation and attention that their parents might not provide most crucially there will be a concerted attempt to engage parents with their childrens education parental involvement is a key factor in how children perform and statistically poorer parents are least likely to do so schools will now offer parents frequent email reports and at secondary school dedicated teachers with whom they can liaise about their child there are some excellent suggestions in the plan the trialling of studio schools which will provide practical vocational experience for year olds is one of them but otherwise wellintentioned as it is much about this plan makes my heart sink in years of labour government education has been deluged with central government initiatives almost none of which were piloted before being rolled out across the country many of them like the national literacy hour now seem to have been hugely expensive failures it would be infinitely more sensible if the ideas in the plan were to be tested before being made national policy so that theory could meet reality putting twoyearolds into nursery for instance will only improve childrens lives if what they get there is very highquality individual stable care mass care without that kind of attention only makes small children more aggressive and insecure but good care is expensive and demands highlytrained and dedicated staff where would the money and the staff come from the example of the sure start programme is not encouraging its funding per head has gone down sharply over the last few years involving parents demands much more than sending out emails one midlands mother who runs a primary pta wonders rhetorically whether ministers have ever spent time in deprived schools in her school only three sets of parents out of a possible ever take part in the pta or attend the annual governors meetings most of the parents dont have computers and many of them have problems with reading themselves they tend to be rather suspicious of the school and consider education to be the teachers job and nothing much to do with them lots of them have been in trouble with the law and some fathers are in jail so its hard to see how the governments proposal to base police officers and youth offending teams in schools will make it a more attractive place to them a london teacher i spoke to at a comprehensive is equally sceptical she says schools main job will still be the delivery of test results because thats what they are judged on that pressure will not change but now they will be expected to deliver much wider social goals in the same time its nonsense weve reached the limits of what we can do with the resources weve got she says if ministers really want to see a change now we need much smaller classes and the freedom to respond to what the real kids in front of us need rather than following a national plan laid down in whitehall,2007-12,broad intention behind ed ballss new childrens plan admirable want give child opportunity experience support already available betteroff home

everyone a chance to make sure that creativity is a key part of their childhood the culture secretary james purnell told the observer the target aims to allow all children to watch and take part in professionally organised music dance theatre and visual arts it is intended to reflect the growing importance of creative industries to the uk economy and will be backed by a gradual increase in

the arts initiative will be one of the most eyecatching elements in the year childrens plan which will be announced to mps by balls ministers believe that the plan breaks new ground by looking at the

association which warned that the development of young girls is being harmed by media images which teach them they are defined by their sexual appeal the commercialisation of childrens lives ministers will publish a report next year as figures show that children are exposed to ads a year balls said children are more exposed to advertising and are more likely to confine their aspirations to specific brands at a particular age but we need to look at the evidence before we jump to policy conclusions purnell said his departments surveys showed that per cent of the public had taken part in some

women have fought for decades to be treated as mens equals yet todays girls are being told that female empowerment simply comes from being sexy according to a new book by the managing editor of the harvard law review in prude how the sexobsessed culture damages girls carol platt liebau says popular culture is undermining girls sense of worth in their most vulnerable formative years and glorifying destructive behaviour the overwhelming lesson teenagers are now learning from the world around them is that being sexy is the ultimate accolade trumping intelligence character and all other accomplishments at every stage of a womans life said liebau a political analyst and the reviews first female managing editor the new female imperative is that it is only through promiscuity and sexual aggression that girls can achieve admiration and recognition she cites films such as cruel intentions and mean girls the music and videos of britney spears christina aguilera and lil kim and advertisements such as the dominatrixthemed campaign for the teenage fashion house bebe featuring mischa barton in a culture that celebrates paris hilton thong underwear and songs like my humps where the female singer expounds the sexual magnetism of her breasts and buttocks theres scant recognition or respect for female modesty or achievement that isnt coupled with sex appeal she adds girls are being led to believe theyre in control when it comes to sexual relationships she continues but theyre actually living in a profoundly antifeminist landscape where girls compete for attention on the basis of how much they are sexually willing to do for the boys liebaus book has won support from feminists including ariel levy whose book female chauvinist pigs denounced what levy termed a raunch culture that she said compels young women to compete to look like slags and sluts although levy was writing about women older than those concerning liebau she agrees that the age at which girls are being influenced by the raunch culture is falling even young girls are the willing active and conscious participants in a tawdry tarty cartoonlike version of female sexuality she says in prude to be published in britain by centre street books this month liebau questions how society has created a climate in which being raunchy is believed to make girls look cool and in which being called a slut is considered preferable to being labelled a prude by most measures young women have never had it better given the breathtaking opportunities before them and the magnificent advantages they enjoy it seems western society has treated young girls with enormous generosity and in many ways it has but not all the changes have been to the good she adds today girls are forced to navigate a minefield more challenging difficult and pressurefilled than ever before when it comes to sex somehow as society has been revelling the ubiquity of sex the very real psychological emotional and physical impact on young girls of giving too much too soon has been discounted she said michele elliott director of the childrens charity kidscape agrees she has launched a campaign against the toy makers responsible for items including a junior poledancing kit thongs for young girls emblazoned with the phrase eye candy and stationery sets stamped with the bunny logo of hugh hefners playboy empire in her book liebau charts how the same creeping sexualising of young girls is endemic across a mass media which she says constitutes the main source of information about sex for to yearolds over the last few decades the west has experienced an incremental but aggressive sexualising of its culture she says today there exists a status quo in which almost everything seems focused on whats going on below the waist although her book has yet to be published in britain liebau is keen to deflect any accusations of prudishness this is about far more than shortterm sexual mores she says living in an overly sexualised culture takes a toll on girls the emphasis on sexiness revealing fashions and the overvaluing of physical appeal creates pressure to measure up to boneslim models or celebrities and leads to unrealistic expectations among young women about how their own bodies should actually look,2007-12,woman fought decade treated men equal yet today girl told female empowerment simply come sexy

children as young as two are to be offered free nursery care in a government drive to intervene in the lives of disadvantaged children at the very earliest stages of their development the subsidised places to be targeted at poorer parents are part of a major overhaul of earlyyears learning that childrens secretary ed balls will present to the commons next tuesday balls will also announce extra support for disabled children and their families because the extra expenses they incur often tip households into poverty the year childrens plan will address the whole experience of modern childhood including concerns about the decline in play outside of school hours and worries about childrens selfconfidence the plan drawn up over the last three months by the department run by gordon browns

homeschool contracts ministers are looking to strengthen the links between parents and schools with more detailed goals for children shared between them balls is expected to set out a broad review of primary education in england in the face of evidence that progress in reading and writing has plateaued it is certain to back the use of the synthetic phonics to teach children to read and will look at whether the curriculum is too crowded government research shows the level of parental engagement in learning is more important in determining a childs educational achievement than social class family size or the parents own academic attainment ministers may also expand parent support advisers who work to provide more effective connections between schools and disaffected parents the move to target twoyearolds for nursery provision means ministers are likely to put less emphasis on further extending provision for three and four year olds who are entitled currently to hours free nursery education for weeks a year due to rise by to hours a week and ultimately to hours childcare spending is now running at more than bn in the current year the daycare trust a charity which campaigns for

a new study by cambridge university reveals women are being locked in to lowpaid low status jobs because they still shoulder the bulk of housework and childcare women are being forced into impossible choices forced to pick between maximising their career opportunities or caring for a family at home but it doesnt have to be this way the two crucial blocks in the road to meaningful choices for women are resolvable the first is the structure of uk workplaces while parents with children under six or disabled children under have had the right to request flexible working since the right of an individual employee to have a say in where and when they work remains the exception a special dispensation granted to some parents and what is the result flexible working is seen as the mummy track pdf those individuals who do take it up often carry the stigma of being considered less committed to the job and less careerfocused this culture combined with a dearth of flexible roles at a senior level largely confines womens flexible choices to lowerpaid work at lower organisational levels it sadly comes as no surprise that only of ftse directorships are held by women the net result is that decisions at the household level are severely constrained faced with the gender pay gap currently standing at it often makes more economic sense for the father to work fulltime and the mother to do the caring at home and work parttime detached from primary responsibility for daily caring and in order to maximise earnings uk men work the longest average weekly hours pdf in the eu unable to compete in the long working hours cultures and faced with a paucity of senior flexible roles women are forced into lowerpaid lowerstatus jobs and so continues the entrenched cycle of gender discrimination with motherhood carrying a penalty without transforming uk workplaces we can barely begin to tackle the second block in the road unequal sharing of work and caring at home the equal opportunities commission eoc found women spend more time than men on housework everyday and caring for children remains a predominantly female occupation without a doubt we need a culture shift caring for children and doing housework should not be seen as a womans job but the outdated structure of our workplaces prevents women and men escaping from the straightjacket of these cultural stereotypes and it is not just women who are paying the price a lack of flexible working currently means million people pdf are not fully using their skills and experience for britain to be competitive in global markets we need to be making full use of our countrys talents fortynine per cent of employers recently surveyed all of whom had implemented flexible working options believed these practices had actively increased productivity for the economy to thrive and citizens to lead fulfilling lives we must shift the balance of power it is individual families themselves who should define how they spend their lives together not employers to put individual women and men back in the driving seat government must extend the right to work flexibly to everyone so that it becomes mainstream in business and evolves into the norm we need to end the uk optout of the eu working time directive which would help curb the destructive long workinghours culture and businesses need to start listening to current

british women are working in lower paid and lower status jobs than their male counterparts because they still shoulder the responsibility for housework and childcare a cambridge university study reveals today a lifestyle divide in which women take on the burden of domestic duties creates a vicious circle as they are then less able to work the long hours needed to win top jobs they then earn less and are reinforced as responsible for household tasks says the europewide research the divide also leaves women with a longer working day despite earning less according to the study the average working week for a woman in europe is hours including paid and domestic work longer than the average of hours for a man in fulltime employment the study the first of its kind since eu members joined from the former eastern bloc suggests efforts to reduce the workplace gender gap in the uk and the rest of europe have made little progress since the early s it reinforces the warnings of several british studies that parttime working now more accessible in the uk thanks to a right to ask to work flexibly can lock women into lowpaid jobs the survey of people across the eu highlights the segregation that leaves women earning less and struggling to break into senior management roles in the uk women make up just under half the workforce but represent less than a third of legislators managers and senior officials threequarters of the eu workforce is managed by men and just of men in fulltime work are managed by women says the report the older eu states including britain appear locked into a pattern in which men work long hours and women are far more likely to work parttime a pattern that the newer member states appear to be emulating only if the lifestyle divide changes say researchers will women have equal opportunities in the world of work the working lifestyles of most people in europe still seem to be determined by gender said the reports lead author brendan burchell in many cases we were struck by how little the results for the longerstanding eu nations like britain germany and france have changed since the best way to break the circle would be to reduce gender inequality in employment and the household together he said encouraging men to take their parental leave entitlements would be a step towards this goal the losers in the home and work gender divide are not restricted to women men also suffer burchell said parttime working women feel they have greater worklife balance and higher job satisfaction than fulltime working men he said changing the divide could come through labour market changes offering women the same fulltime higher status working opportunities as men he added or it could come through a greater sharing of domestic

in my own lifetime the concept of female liberation has travelled a great distance although my mother was not a bra burner during the s its not hard to trace the steps and see how much feminism has developed in the past half century across the globe there are at least three different phases being played out at any one time the first and still the largest is a human rights movement for women whose marginalisation or mistreatment by men is enshrined in the culture and politics of their country as in amnestys international violence against womens act the second is more focused on equality of pay and conditions for women who have gained the vote and a certain degree of legal protection in society and a third more fragmented phase where women champion a variety of ways to express their hard won freedoms from the right to lap dance and binge drink with the rest of the lads to the right to stay at home with the kids if i want to as championed in the us mommy wars but last weekend i saw a sudden shift in gear for feminism a new and urgent call for women to start thinking differently not just about themselves but about men the spur to this new frontier is the human fertilisation and embryology bill which brings together the two hitherto separate issues of the right of lesbian couples to parent a child with the need of a child for a father conflating these two enormous questions has forced a number of feminist writers in the uk media to choose the importance of female rights over male rights and it is not easy reading while i would normally enjoy an exposition of the complex case for women by the observers mary riddell i knew we were on new territory when the headline over her piece last weekend left me reeling not because i cant see a certain logic to her statement that a child doesnt need a father to be happy there are innumerable cases of happy children brought up by single mothers as there will be for gay couples of both sexes im reeling because a headline like that does huge unnecessary damage to men if you find that hard to believe imagine the effect on a young teenage boy reading the paper over your shoulder what is the logical conclusion for young men like him not wanted not needed free to roam disconnected in a world of random encounters i know that many women and men too believe that to be the classic male fantasy but there is plenty of evidence that behind the fantasy disconnection is the great male fear as far back as the s emile durkheim could show us that relationship breakdown and the resulting social isolation was the single most prevalent cause for male suicide numerous studies since then have echoed those findings in america subscription required in australia and elsewhere closer to home research into the causes of male gang culture repeatedly throws up evidence that young boys robbed of parental attention in our rigid work economy go in search of alternative relationships to give them a sense of identity and security being young their emotional commitment to the gang is raw and extreme its like a family your bredren brethren if youve lost a friend most people my age would think they had to take a life from the other side he was your bredren and you cant let a life go away like that such expressions of male need for belonging are not exclusive in a radio interview this week sonny gillespie revealed that he took to a drugs lifestyle just to find closeness with other musicians on the same day we saw rapper cent reach out to his rival kanye west who was in tears over the death of his mother and haunting us each day etem celebis page on the social networking site myspace etem was murdered just hanging out in the street outside his home waiting for pals did you know as dana boyd revealed in her essay on apophenia that more boys join networking sites specifically to make friends than girls there is only one scenario that would permit the female race to carve out a future in which men are not as essential as women to the procreation and nurturing of children that would be if men themselves were robot machines unaffected by the loss of connection to humanitys essential means of regeneration untouched by the loss of a role at the very core of human existence but thankfully that scenario is not available its time for us all but particularly women in this case to join up the dots the very men that we are seeking to disempower are the dear sons of the women we fought to empower all those years back excluding men can only lead to more alienated disconnected macho behaviour and violence its time for those women that can empathise include and nurture to do just that thirdwave feminists should be wise enough to move beyond the duelling cultures of the past where men and women battle it out in a zerosum game the winner taking all for society to reap the benefits of women in their next more encompassing phase of female empowerment then all must be included all must be
