john simmonds raises two issues in his letter january first he questions the data and its analysis cited in the article rising adoptions penalise poor families but dont cut numbers in care says report january without outlining his concerns i have published a spreadsheet showing sources of data assumptions made and the calculations bilsonorgukcalculations so that he or anyone else can see them second i make no claim that there is an explicit policy to address poverty through adoption i do show that a policy of increasing adoption to reduce the number of children in longstay care leads instead to an increase in care the government doesnt provide statistics relating adoptions to levels of poverty but research shows that children living in the of most deprived communities are almost times more likely to be in care than in the least deprived communities it is thus highly likely that adoption is concentrated in these poor communities my most worrying finding is that if local authorities are grouped into thirds based on high medium and low levels of children leaving care to be adopted then highuse authorities increased children in care by in the past five years middle use increased it and in low use it fell by we need research to look at the link between increasing numbers of children in care alongside rising use of adoption but it is already clear that policymakers should not assume that increasing adoption will reduce numbers in care dr andy bilson emeritus professor of social work university of central lancashire i have enormous respect for john simmonds but i suggest that his response to your article on the rise in adoption from care fails to take account of a key element in the process of course the courts are usually rigorous in their application of the best interests test but they are often applying this months or even years after the crucial decisions about child protection and family support have been made if those decisions were taken in a climate of i pressure to remove children to avoid public criticism ii pressure to consider adoption as the best solution at a relatively early stage and iii serious cuts in family support services then the courts might well find and frequently do that the passage of time has cut off options that might have been better for the child in an ideal world the clock cannot be turned back but we should be looking seriously at the consequences of current policy and practice and at what might be the alternatives having been present at the meeting to which john refers i am aware that the data are being contested and i hope this process will lead to robust conclusions that we can all get behind dr nigel thomas professor of childhood and youth research university of central lancashire as a former family magistrate i was involved in many cases where we made the decision to remove a child from her parents for adoption i do not believe that the decision was ever made on the basis of the poverty of the natural parents however it was frequently made on the basis of the parents or mothers mental health andor drug addiction intuitively i suggest that these factors are correlated with poverty and unemployment and also that their effect is more severe where people are materially deprived julia carter london while by law adoptions should only happen when nothing else will do as john simmonds says by the time of a final court hearing often months or years later social services have already shaped the case against the mother in favour of adoption judges usually follow their recommendations and when they dont social services fight to get their way a teenage mum we tried to help was taken to court two days after an emergency caesarean so her baby could be removed immediately when the judge refused she was isolated from her support network in a mother and baby unit under constant critical observation not surprisingly although the baby flourished her mother was deemed unfit and the child was adopted against the family wishes corambaaf disputes the connection between poverty increasing levels of adoption and children in care but offers no explanation the royal college of paediatrics and child health has just reported worsening illhealth among children in poverty yet time and again social services scrutinise workingclass mothers triggering child protection intervention when the obvious problem is poverty in our dossier suffer the little children and their mothers the mothers whose children were adopted were all on low incomes half had been teenage mothers half were women of colour half were survivors of rape or domestic violence one mother with a learning disability had her first baby adopted at birth never given a chance to care a young couple who asked for advice about a mark on one of their childrens faces ended up in the high court without a lawyer unable to stop their adoption a woman raped by the childrens father who was convicted was accused of failing to protect them and the children were adopted by strangers in preference to their grandparents fostering and adoption produce millions in profit for private companies the children and social work bill now in parliament would extend that lucrative privatisation by removing statutory protection for children in care the lifelong trauma of separation on children and their birth families is

the prospect of statemaintained nurseries closing en masse sounds the lowest note of the austerity politics maintained nurseries have enjoyed a level of ofsted success that the rest of the education sector might look upon with envy in of those nurseries achieved an outstanding rating compared with just of the sector as a whole so my wife and i were more than happy to move our youngest adopted child from his private nursery when he became eligible to attend six months later i would say that that our experience of his new nursery has been similarly outstanding that was clear from the very first time we attended cheveley park durham the walls were bursting with beautiful displays and the confidence of the staff in dealing with our child meant he adapted quickly and enjoyed being there from the outset as a result his progress accelerated quickly within a month he could recognise his printed name and made a pretty good stab at writing it too he now comes home with enough paintings and make and dos to fill our recycling bin twice every week and his newfound love of drawing has wallpapered the fridge his language skills have mushroomed and the nurserys structured approach to phonics is providing him with a solid base that he can build on in reception the prospect of it closing is outrageous one clear strength of the nursery is its attachment to the local primary school and the resulting ethos it shares with its educational partner our son wears the same school uniform as the older children is taught by nursery assistants who work across both preschool and reception classes and performed the christmas pantomime alongside children from the two years above him his nursery experience is integrated within the community of the school and as a result we know that the transition to primary school ought to be seamless his first day in reception will be a gentle continuation of his present experiences rather than a jarring tearfilled departure im not suggesting that the key workers in his private nursery werent good they absolutely cared for the children who attended but the nurserys high turnover of staff meant that a majority of workers there were very young and so had by definition limited experience conversely the staff profile working within his statemaintained nursery hasnt changed for years the level of experience that this produces the resources that those staff have built up over the years and the implementation of refined working practices doesnt compare at all with the private nursery he attended before perhaps the most important outcome of his attendance at cheveley park is the development of his social skills the lack of focused activities in his previous nursery meant that he was often left to his own devices for large chunks of the day we quite often arrived at his nursery to find him looking a little lost by the sandpit with the same dinosaur in his hand that he was playing with the previous day by contrast his present nursery works hard to make sure that he interacts with his peers and he seems like an altogether more confident little boy it is this experience that leads us to believe that organisations like cheveley park ought to be celebrated their remit ought to be extended rather than diminished highquality nursery education is a fundamental social leveller and an outstanding nursery primer shouldnt be thwarted by financial restrictions indeed if we are serious about correcting our lack of social mobility a professionally determined preschool should sit at the heart of every

youve read the headlines about the council services facing death by a thousand cuts from nursery schools to libraries and community transport for disabled school pupils after a realterms cut of in core government grants since the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy cipfa says we are now at the point where councils are close to the brink of insolvency if further proof were needed look over to surrey and its council tax referendum where a council is effectively admitting to voters it can no longer afford to help elderly residents get dressed or to keep learning disabled adults safe this is only the beginning local government is estimated to be facing a funding black hole of bn by if there is any doubt about the brutal impact of these cuts on the ground just take a look at sunderland which is likely to become the only major city in the uk with no refuges for domestic violence victims for the past years claire phillipson director of wearside women in need wwn a local nonprofit organisation that runs four safe houses and multiple support programmes across sunderland has been on the frontline of domestic abuse services in the area she has witnessed firsthand over decades the progress thats been made from the s when police refused to come out to women attacked by their partners and victims had nowhere to go to today when police work side by side with her staff to help women in specialist refuges but just as she is nearing retirement phillipson says shes watching everything be unravelled when wwns latest contract with sunderland council ends in june shes been told its annual grant will be pulled that means zero funding for sunderlands refuge or the refuge that supports black and minority ethnic or older women or their hour helpline less a budget cut more a total destruction some women a year rely on wwns services that doesnt include the children phillipson adds before she met the council at the end of last year she had no idea it was considering stopping all funding no one would expect it she says weve already been cut to the bone since wwn has already had its budget cut by a third specialist services for children escaping domestic violence were the first thing to go next the programme supporting vulnerable homeless women then a residential project for abuse victims with mental health problems there were trained staff now there are sunderland council denies there wont be a service helping the victims of domestic violence after june but in the face of unprecedented budget pressures it says many services have to be reviewed refreshed and reorganised no final decision has actually been made on its budget for next year it adds and its continuing to consult on the issue while making a bid along with other northeastern councils and partners to a central government domestic abuse fund yet unless phillipson is told soon that the funding will be protected it will mean closed signs on sunderlands refuge doors well have to start telling women in the refuges she says it would be convenient for westminster politicians to believe such conversations would have nothing to do with them but the decisions that councils such as sunderland are having to make are a direct result of central governments longstanding imposition of austerity the great irony of the drive to save money by gutting councils is that aside from the human cost economically such a move is counterproductive wwn brings in half a million pounds each year through rent and fundraising but take away core funding from the state and that becomes impossible like taking bricks out the wall and the house falling down as phillipson puts it widen the picture and the hidden costs of not responding to domestic violence get bigger from the lost taxes of women who cant go to work because theyve been isolated by abusers to the nhs caring for premature babies born early after their mothers are beaten or the education and benefit system thats left to deal with children too traumatised to stay in school phillipson recently did the housing sums based on the statutorily homeless women her organisation helped last year alone if sunderlands refuges hadnt existed it would have cost the council m to house them all in bampbs as it is austerity is essentially governance in panic mode when the screws have been tightened on councils by central government anything can go at best it leads to bids to deliver specialist services on a shoestring that myth that all you need for domestic violence support is a canny woman with a cup of tea phillipson says at worst what used to be automatic markers of a civilised community are now expendable and with it so are some of the most vulnerable members of society lately phillipson keeps remembering some of the survivors shes helped over the years such as one woman in her s who adored the beach only all her married life her husband stopped her from seeing it with the support of the refuge she was able to run around in the waves but what plagues the wwn director is the thought of the women they might not be there for if the refuges close down i cant bear that she

the uks shocking class pay gap means professional employees from poorer backgrounds are paid almost a year less on average than their peers from more privileged families according to research for the social mobility commission the study found that even those from working class families who have exactly the same role education and experience as their colleagues from more advantaged backgrounds are still paid on average less equating to just under a year the class pay gap is worse for women and for people from minorityethnic backgrounds according to the research carried out for the commission by the london school of economics and university college london alan milburn the former labour minister who chairs the commission said he would send details of the findings to employers and expected them to take action to end the shocking class earnings penalty milburn said this unprecedented research provides powerful new evidence that britain remains a deeply elitist society the study using data covering almost people drawn from the uk labour force survey found that on average professionals from more disadvantaged backgrounds were paid less than their more privileged peers or a year the difference is partly explained by the fact that people whose parents had professional jobs tend on average to be better educated the statistics also show they are more likely to join bigger firms or to work in london both of which are associated with higher pay the study identified signs of what it called occupational segregation whereby people from working class backgrounds are more likely to enter a profession at a lowerpaid level however the authors found that the pay gap remained even when people from different backgrounds were professionally the same in every way we can measure and meant other factors must be at work these could include people from poorer backgrounds being less likely to ask for pay rises or having fewer chances to network other possible explanations include conscious or unconscious class discrimination and the idea of cultural matching whereby those in senior positions promote people they feel similar to the research found more glaring class pay gaps in some professions than others while it was fairly modest in nursing teaching social work and life sciences in medicine the difference in average annual pay was just over and in finance it was more than parallel analysis of the labour force data showed medicine was also the profession least accessible in the first place to people from working class backgrounds with these comprising just of the total compared with of the population next worst was journalism with of people coming from poorer backgrounds overall the study found people from a professional or managerial family were times more likely to end up in a similar job themselves than people from less advantaged backgrounds milburn said it cannot be right that people from working class backgrounds were paid so much less many professional firms are doing excellent work to open their doors to people from all backgrounds but this research suggests much more needs to be done to ensure that britain is a place where everyone has an equal chance of success regardless of where they have come from he said labours shadow education secretary angela rayner said the report showed clear evidence that even when working class people do well in life they are still penalised in their pay packets she added this kind of pay gap underlines the endemic elitism that remains in our society we are far from being a britain that works for all tim farron the liberal democrat leader said the report exposes the gaping class divide at the heart of our society that we all already knew existed he added its time for the government to not just say the right thing but do the right thing by investing in education and ensuring every person is given a chance to succeed a government spokesman said work is the best route out of poverty and education is key to making sure everyone can go as far as their talents will take them we are looking at ways to deliver more good school places in more parts of the country investing in improving careers

there are very serious questions raised by your article rising adoptions penalise poor families but dont cut numbers in care says report january the implications suggest a link between increasing levels of poverty and increasing numbers of children being adopted without the consent of their parents by coincidence the issues were discussed last week at our research advisory group which includes some of the leading researchers in the field of family placement in the uk questions were raised by the group about the data and data analysis at the heart of this set of findings which need to be addressed urgently but the suggestion that there is an explicit policy to address poverty through adoption is crude and not supported by other robust studies local authorities and the courts must comply with the strictest of rules embedded in law when deciding on the future of children what the reported research does not address or even mention is anything about the high levels of vulnerability of those children who are placed under the authority of the court for adoption the overriding issue has been made absolutely clear by the president of the family division that this adoption can only happen where nothing else will do that is the toughest of tests and one that defeats any suggestion of an illicit state policy john simmonds director of policy research and development corambaaf dr andy bilsons findings tell us that despite the current policy which encourages adoption rather than putting children into care the number of children in care is still rising he found adoptions have risen by over the past five years compared with the five previous years but over the same period the number of children in care rose by to a mothers work bringing up children is the foundation of a healthy nation that key role is not only ignored but also rejected by any government that makes it closer and closer to impossible by reducing incomes while a chaotic housing market is forever increasing rents whether they are unemployed or in work the number of hungry and impoverished children painfully removed from their parents by social services can only continue to increase unless there is a powerful intervention by government that gives all mothers and their families adequate incomes and affordable housing a nation that does not maintain its human foundations is on the way to collapse rev paul nicolson taxpayers against poverty i totally agree with sarah anderson on the abuse of foster carers we are the epitome of the gig economy we deserve rights january the even greater abuse is that of the families who take these children for life as adopters at that point the local authorities pass the buck and you are in it on your own many parents end up never being able to work again overwhelmed by these childrens extreme needs as a single parent i spend days working for my childs needs emailing social workers school contacting possible therapist filling

us currently or indeed when school sends my child home on another exclusion i have to be mother social worker counsellor therapist teacher all rolled into one for which i get not a penny from the state luckily i have a small investment company that keeps us going without that my altruistic decision all those years ago to parent a child who desperately needed a family would have spun us into poverty as it has done for many families across the uk i strongly believe that once it has been identified that a childs needs are this extreme adopters should receive a modest but reasonable salary to do the states work having children like this in care would cost somewhere in the region of a year my child is wonderful and i wouldnt be without them but this is state abuse at its extreme name and

australia must improve its national data collection on domestic and family violence to identify gaps in services and prevent avoidable deaths the human rights commission has said in a report released on tuesday the commission called for the commonwealth to establish national mechanisms to report collect analyse and share data on deaths which occur in a domestic or family violence setting australia has a human rights obligation to assess the risk factors in relation to domestic violence death and to shape policy and law based on empirical evidence the report said it called for a national rollout of statebased domestic and family violence death review teams the state governmentfunded teams which have different origins mandates and functions seek to identify patterns of deaths and can detect vulnerable groups or factors that lead to deaths the report said however there are no teams in tasmania act or northern territory and the resulting gaps in the data make national comparisons impossible and responses difficult in victoria last year women died from probable or possible homicide the states coroner reported more than women across the country were killed in an estimated of them in domestic violences circumstances according to activist group destroy the joint tuesdays report said more than of the homicide incidents between and occurred in a domestic context with almost of those deaths cases of intimate partner homicide children comprised the second largest group of victims and the average age of those killed by a parent or step parent was years old but current data cannot show with certainty that domestic violence was the cause of death in all such cases the sex discrimination commissioner kate jenkins told guardian australia the lack of national data meant australia was missing opportunities to learn and to avoid further deaths the commission called for jurisdictions to build on existing work including the establishment of the first review team in victoria and a network in which set benchmarks for collecting authoritative and consistent national data the systems are meant to identify clusters of issues as well as individual service issues jenkins said so they can identify for example if there are a number of deaths involving aboriginal or torres strait islander men women and children by looking at those groups we can see themes and trends and intervene in specific areas similarly if we identify particular geographic areas we might identify that services in that area are not good or there are other stresses impacting the community which we could proactively change indigenous women are much more likely than nonindigenous women to be admitted to hospital for domestic and family violence injuries in the northern territory where a third of the population is indigenous the rate is about times higher on monday a yearold man faced court charged with the murder of his former partner in tennant creek a town that experienced a more than increase in domestic violencerelated assaults in the year to november police were called to the northern territory town on friday afternoon where the body of a yearold woman was found inside a town camp house the man was arrested at the scene the council of australian governments has committed to working towards a crossjurisdiction system to share information including about existing domestic violence orders family and domestic violence doesnt get contained by borders jenkins said it would be really important for police for example in one state to know that someone has moved to another state and is under particular protection orders the protection of privacy needs to be weighed against safety of women and families in particular the review teams also evaluate elements in deaths such as the interactions of the deceased and the perpetrator with various systems which is a really important piece of information to ensure that our systems are delivering better services to us jenkins said a coronial inquiry into the deaths of two women in alice springs last year noted both victims had dozens of interactions with the justice system including police callouts to reported incidents apprehended domestic violence orders against their partners and interactions with shelters and refuges jenkins noted recent progress including victorias royal commission which resulted in a year domestic violence plan and reviews in south australia and queensland but said more was needed to keep the momentum going in january last year the guardian reported each state and

eventually you get to a point in midadulthood having digested a few newspapers and muted a few politicians when you start to wonder do cities actually want their women to die otherwise why take these backward steps cutting services so that more and more womens refuges are forced to close backward steps no its more like being dragged through shrubland into a dimmer darker place sunderland is about to become the first uk city without a single domestic violence refuge the bleakness of this is exhausting the knowledge that even if a woman in sunderland finds the courage cash and energy to leave the partner that hits her soon there will be nowhere for her to go the chances are she will end up on the streets st mungos reports a third of the women they work with say domestic violence contributed to their homelessness or in a bampb floundering with no support no advice on how to begin a life alone and of course that itch that feeling that she will always be listening for steps behind her that she is never safe or else of course like the two women murdered by their partners in england and wales every week shell return to a man that kills her and the irony is that apart from at this very sharpest end of the issue where hundreds of women are being turned away from refuges due in part to almost a fifth closing since elsewhere hard work is paying off police now know how to talk to victims of abuse how to deal with the shadowy cases the crimes that happen in family homes schools now teach pupils the acceptable boundaries of relationships due to charities working tirelessly to research and fight dating abuse and expose the horrors of being and terrified yet still if a woman runs cuts in funding mean shell have nowhere to go it took a long time to get here to a place where we could talk about domestic violence and then acknowledge the many forms it can take and then the difficulties of escaping it it took a long time before refuges opened across the country offering beds and safety to women whose black eyes had been politely ignored by their bosses at home their children silently watching the ads a couple of years ago jenny smith wrote the refuge a book about finding sanctuary in the worlds first safe house for women it was may when women werent allowed to apply for a mortgage without a man and there was no such thing as marital rape after two years of being kicked around people turning away when her husband hit her on the street she happened upon a piece in the daily mirror which read victims of domestic violence need help she hid the article under the carpet so he wouldnt find it he had beaten her stabbed her burned and bitten her once he tried to drown her when smith arrived at the refuge a terraced house on the other side of london with her two babies they welcomed her in telling her she was safe fortyfour years later two out of every three women that approach a refuge for help are being turned away when we hear about sunderland losing its last refuge its as if another brick has been removed from that first safe house in london its not safe at its foundation its not safe it sounds flippant to wonder whether cities care about the lives of their vulnerable women whether they want them to die but all evidence points in that direction the places those women go to stay alive are disappearing its dreadful to revisit smiths book those s campaigners feeling they had achieved so much only for the s government to dismantle their efforts with shrugs and cuts reading i keep thinking of that hitchcock technique where he films a

the push to increase adoption in england is punishing lowincome women who are increasingly losing their children due to poverty according to research by legal action for women a report to be presented at the house of commons on wednesday contains new research from the legal service and campaign group which suggests the policy of increasing adoption has not reduced the number of children in care as it was intended to but has increased the number of those separated from their parents dr andy bilson emeritus professor of social work at the university of lancashire has been analysing the data gathered between march and he found the number of children from care living with adopted parents or special guardians has increased from to a rise of his research found adoptions have risen by over the past five years compared with the five previous years but over the same period the number of children in care rose by to this is very unlikely to be due to an increase in abuse said bilson the vast majority of this is about neglect or emotional abuse often through witnessing domestic violence both of these can be better dealt with through family support and responses to poverty and deprivation we are more willing to spend money on someone else looking after these children than in making sure the parents make a good job of it bilsons research is part of the dossier of evidence collected by legal action for women to be presented at the house of commons on wednesday the report suffer the little children examines what the group calls the unjust separation of children from their mothers it finds the number of lookedafter children in england is the highest it has been since one in five children under five are referred to childrens services one in are investigated and adoptions are higher than in any other european country and now stand at the highest level since data was first collected more than of adoptions are done without the consent of the family the report states the report examined the cases of women all of whom came for help to fight for their children between them the women had children of the women had suffered rape andor domestic violence did not have a lawyer and had mental health problems anne neale one of the reports authors said charges of neglect are used to punish especially singlemother families for their unbearably low incomes the fundamental relationship between mother and child is dismissed as irrelevant to a childs wellbeing and development and the trauma of separation and its lifelong consequences are ignored mothers who are victims of domestic violence are refused help blamed for failing to protect their children and punished with their removal the report highlights the secrecy of family courts where adoption decisions are made in private hearings in which mothers are prevented by law from talking about the loss of their children donna clarke whose granddaughter was taken from her teenage mother and handed to adoptive parents will speak on wednesday at the launch she said families were being punished for living in poverty it is a form of social cleansing she said vulnerable people are having their children taken away it is all about them judging the risk of significant harm but if they spent the money on putting in the support that was needed many of these families would be able to keep their children clarkes granddaughter was adopted when she was monthsold after spending the first five months with her biological mother a teenager with learning difficulties the baby was sent to a foster parent at five months while adoption proceedings got underway the babys grandparents asked to be considered but none were deemed suitable and the child was given to new adoptive parents clarke is able to write and receive two letters a year from the adoptive parents to keep in touch with her granddaughter her son the babys father and the babys mother have gone on to have other children whom they are successfully caring for the drive to increase adoptions began under tony blairs government in an attempt to reduce the numbers of children in longterm care it was continued under david cameron who said that the children and social work bill currently in parliament was designed to tip the balance in favour of permanent adoption where that is the right thing for the child even when that means overriding family ties in a high court ruling sir james munby the president of the high court family division said the political drive to hasten and increase adoption should not override due process

working with no employment rights is one of the big downsides of the socalled gig economy now foster care workers are joining bike couriers and taxi drivers to fight for the recognition they deserve sarah anderson fosters teenagers and is so angry she is the new face of the foster care workers union its aim to secure employment rights for the foster families in the uk anderson says the current system is essentially broken and does not help those who need it most the children because it is archaic foster carers are technically selfemployed but they can work for only one local authority or independent foster agency at a time in england and will often only earn while they have a child placed with them were the epitome of the gig economy says anderson but the care we give these children on behalf of their corporate parent the government is important we need and deserve workers rights and professional respect anderson loves her job but she says most foster care workers are underpaid and undervalued and desperately need the help of the fcwu which launched as a branch of the independent workers union of great britain iwgb in september there are many thousands of us who are frankly being taken advantage of through low pay slashed allowances no job protection and the fear of false allegation she stresses anderson is one of the foster care workers who voted to unionise and is now the branchs spokeswoman i fundamentally think this will drive up standards in foster care if you treat people better whilst theyre doing a job and this is a job theyll do it better social care cuts have gone from the fat to the bone according to the fostering network the charity reported in april that twothirds of foster care workers in the uk felt falling budgets had harmed the children they look after with saying their own payments were cut just last week bradford became the latest council to vote to cut allowances for its foster carers foster carers receive an allowance per child which varies according to age or if they have special needs this is to be spent solely on the childs share of food utilities school uniform transport and other essentials the basic weekly allowance for a primary schoolaged child is but this increases in london and the southeast to and respectively some also receive a feethe fostering network says half of all uk foster carers receive no fee at all and are increasingly subsidising cut allowances from their own pockets agencies that supply foster carers to local authorities at some cost typically pay them much more and are capable of fronting up financial benefits socalled golden hellos it is a practice anderson disapproves of because it puts councils who cannot offer such incentives at a disadvantage although money is not the main reason families choose to foster herself included anderson believes earnings should be significant for the most experienced who look after the most challenging children we do what nobody else wants to explains anderson were looking after some of our most troubled difficult children hours a day its a job which can bring you to your knees but its worth it when you see a child succeed even in the smallest way anderson can net up to in fees and allowances a year looking after two damaged and traumatised young people with serious mental health needs but broken down the in fees and allowances she gets per child per week equates to around an hour i think that shows were no fat cats she observes people think were the baddies for taking money but you wouldnt ask a paediatric nurse or a teacher to work for nothing we are no different and the more highly skilled we are the more we should be paid this is my career we do a valuable job for society but because we have no employment status were terribly insecure we can be deregistered by a local authority or agency at any time with no explanation we absolutely need this union she says adding that during a time of cuts safeguarding workers is more important than ever put it this way if there are no foster carers theres no foster care anderson says having workers employment status would give foster carers more recognition from social services the government and also the public i think many people have no idea what its like to do this job she says with a wry smile not only are we in loco parentis providing a stable loving and boundaried home environment we are highly skilled highly trained workers if youve trained and worked hard to be a professional you need to be treated as one she also believes the perceived low status is putting potential foster carers off something the system can little afford given that around more are needed in the uk in the next year although the fcwu is in a fledgling stage with just a few hundred members momentum is high according to the iwgb its most pressing task is to get legislation passed to get workers rights status we want job protection fair pay including pay protection holiday entitlement and protection when were sick just like any other workers says anderson although she says there is no shortage of volunteers among foster carers for a test case such as the one recently won by iwgb on behalf of a courier for citysprint this isnt being pursued yet instead the union is setting up an allparty parliamentary group appg to look at employment rights for foster care workers in a bid to get legislative change we need the appg to lobby parliament to change legislation for foster carers dragging the way we currently work into the st century she says anderson also wants foster care workers protected from unfounded allegations ive got direct experience of the stress and upset of this as well as the loss of livelihood whilst theyre investigated it should not take upwards of four months to investigate an allegation we want a shorter and more transparent process and appropriate union and legal representation for the foster care workers facing them we also want compensation if they are proved unfounded and because they do not have worker employment status foster carers are not protected by current whistleblowing law either this is something the union will address too although anderson is cynical about whether this alone will be an incentive for carers to speak out often foster carers are working in a climate of fear she says the union also wants a central and independent register for foster care workers for their own benefit as well as for that of the local authorities and agencies currently local authorities and independent fostering agencies have to assess foster care workers each time they move which costs time and money and removes them from the carer pool this will save time and money says anderson but would it be safe all foster care workers need to be thoroughly vetted and under any new system they would be she also wants the union to give independent support and advice to foster care workers most existing advice has been devised by social workers any job in child social care is difficult but theyre at a different coalface to us most of all anderson wants to see positive change affecting the outcomes of the children she looks after we love them but someone has to stand up and say that looking after a child keeping them safe and giving them a chance in life whilst being paid and treated as a professional by society are not

the uk risks creating a fatherhood penalty as an increasing number of men jettison their careers for less demanding jobs which give them more time with their families according to a major new study the modern families index published on monday is the largest survey of its kind to measure how families achieve a worklife balance it finds that nearly half of working fathers want to downshift to a less stressful job because they cannot balance the demands of work and family life just over a third say they would be willing to take a pay cut to achieve a better worklife balance significantly these aspirations are more pronounced among younger fathers the index produced by the charity working families and nursery provider bright horizons found that of millennial fathers want to downshift to a less stressful job while would take a pay cut to achieve a better worklife balance the existence of the motherhood penalty is well documented the fawcett society campaign group says the penalty results in women being more likely to work parttime to be in lowskilled jobs and to make up twothirds of the lowpaid sarah jackson chief executive of working families says a fatherhood penalty is also now emerging employers need to ensure that work is designed in a way that helps women and men find a good worklife fit jackson said making roles flexible by default and a healthy dose of realism when it comes to what can be done in the hours available are absolutely vital a gamechanging first step would be government creating a new properly paid extended period of paternity leave overall the survey found only one in five families believe they are managing to achieve a balance between the money they bring in and the amount of time they spend together over a third of families believe they either have not got enough time or money this years survey suggests a significant proportion of fathers are playing a more active role in childrearing a quarter said that they dropped their children at school or nursery every day seven out of ten said that they worked flexibly to fulfil their caring responsibilities but the survey also found that many fathers reported working extra hours because it was the only way to deal with their workload and that being seen to do long hours was important where they worked twice the number of fathers as mothers believe that flexible workers are viewed as less committed by employers its clear that the reconciliation of work and family life is now a priority for both mothers and fathers said denise priest director of employer partnerships at bright horizons it is impossible to overstate the positive impact of an understanding and supportive employer one that adapts to its employees needs so that they can progress in their careers leading employers are those that protect their employees from parental penalties and provide optimum work and care arrangements the survey found that almost threequarters of parents said they worked at home in the evenings and at weekends one in five parents working full time said they put in five extra weeks a year the equivalent of their annual holiday allowance in unpaid work just to keep up with the

labour is calling for urgent action to improve the gender mix at the top of the civil service after highlighting that the most senior committee in whitehall has more members who are knights than women the party is calling for the new permanent secretary for the trade department antonia romeo to be given a place on the civil service board which describes itself as the highest level of governance in whitehall the group which is made up of of the most senior officials in government and chaired by the cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood includes three women and four men who have been awarded knighthoods paula sherriff shadow minister for women and equalities said the situation was unacceptable it just isnt healthy for government to be run by a narrow closed circle we cannot hope for government policy to take into account the diversity of the british public if people making decisions all went to the same schools and universities and come from similar backgrounds she said when ministers have appointed more knights of the realm than women at the top level of government it doesnt say much for the tories record on equal opportunities labour also criticised a decision by david cameron to give himself more power in choosing appointments arguing that he replaced nine of the most senior women with men during his tenure those decisions took place in a number of leading departments including defence climate change the environment health the home office justice international aid transport and hmrc according to the governments website the civil service board also has a subcommittee on corporate management that boasts more people called mark than women although its makeup could be even less representative than it appears the webpage lists lin homer as the one female member but given that she has now retired from her role at the top of hmrc the grouping may now be male however a third committee dedicated to peoplerelated issues does have a better gender mix with eight female members making up more than of the total labour put together a series of written answers and research to show that the problem is wider than just the most senior civil service boards they say gender diversity at the top of government has gone backwards under successive conservative governments with the number of women holding the most senior post within a department falling by half in five years sheriff argued that theresa mays shakeup of government had provided the opportunity to shift the dial but for the new brexit department she chose a man oliver robbins although she has she chosen romeo for trade in a woman was in charge in half of the top government departments while now even with this weeks appointment the number is just four however the government claims there are

court orders protecting vulnerable children could become unenforceable if the government pushes through changes exempting councils from their legal obligations the magistrates association ma has warned in a highly unusual intervention during the passage of a parliamentary bill the ma which represents justices of the peace in england and wales has raised grave concerns about the children and social work bill which returns to the commons on tuesday the bill came under attack in the lords before christmas where its most controversial proposal allowing councils to opt out of their legal obligations was defeated one criminal justice source described the proposals as a conveyor belt to catastrophe the crossbench peer david ramsbotham successfully moved an amendment deleting the clause designed to give ministers extensive powers to sidestep childrens legal rights that have built up over decades ministers are expected however to reintroduce it in the commons this week the education minister john nash has defended the proposal on the grounds that the unintended buildup of childrens legal protections over the years has resulted in overregulation which gets in the way of good social work practice the provision would allow ministers to permit councils to suspend specific social care legal obligations for a threeyear period with the possibility of a further threeyear extension and the option for a permanent exemption if the innovative practices they enable are deemed a success malcolm richardson national chair of the ma said we are concerned that court orders may be unenforceable against a particular local authority where they have been granted an exception under the proposed innovation clause it would be a regrettable waste of court resources if a local authority were ordered to come before the court to account for a failure to adhere to legislation which does not apply to them consistency before the court will be very difficult to achieve safeguarding children is a crucial part of the work of magistrates in the family and youth court jurisdictions richardson said while the magistrates association supports the governments objective to encourage best practice through innovation the best interests of the child are and must remain the determining factor where duty of care responsibilities towards looked after children are involved our members will be very concerned at possible implications for both family and youth justice if fundamental protections for children are not guaranteed the organisation article which campaigns for childrens rights is one of many groups that have raised concerns about the bill its director carolyne willow said exemptions could severely fracture safeguarding duties including the duty to appoint independent advocates the duty to have a complaints procedure and the duty to appoint independent visitors since when did these become red tape that children and young people have not been consulted is a disgrace the new clauses do not even require local authorities to consult children and young people prior to requesting the government absolve them of their duties they must simply consider doing

political parties should be forced by law to field female candidates in at least of constituencies if they fail to significantly boost the number of women in parliament by the women and equalities select committee has said the committee chair and former conservative culture secretary and minister for women maria miller said britain had slipped to a shockingly low th in the world league table for female representation from th in as well as urging theresa may to consider legislation for political parties including financial penalties for those that fall short her group called on the prime minister to set a domestic target also of for the proportion of female mps actually elected to westminster by the demands for urgent action come as party leaders theresa may jeremy corbyn tim farron and nicola sturgeon receive written warnings that the governments plan to redraw constituency boundaries will not just stall but reverse progress for women in politics the letter from the chief executive of the fawcett society sam smethers reveals an analysis suggesting the policy will have a disproportionate impact on female politicians who are more likely to represent marginal seats the figures suggest pushing ahead with the reform could result in fewer women in parliament pushing the overall proportion down from to the select committee report said the lack of women in the house of commons already represented a serious democratic deficit and said the murder of jo cox and threats and abuse aimed at other female mps are not neutral acts for those considering a career in politics it has been almost years since the first woman mp was elected but it is a shocking reality that there have only ever been as many women mps as there are men sitting in the house of commons today it said the group heard from corbyn farron the snps westminster leader angus robertson and tory chair patrick mcloughlin who all agreed the commons would benefit from gender equality and put forward plans to address the issue but we saw little to justify their confidence that these will be sufficient said miller we need concrete action plans we need party leadership to provide clear and strong direction in working with local parties to deliver more women candidates we need to see more women candidates in winnable seats above all parties need to be transparent and accountable in their progress or lack of it despite clear scepticism about whether parties can make progress the committee suggested that political parties should initially be allowed to try to meet the challenge voluntarily through published plans however it warned that significantly less than of the parliamentary candidates fielded in were female and said that while parties express confidence in their own internal mechanisms for improving the situation failure to act must be challenged the government should be prepared to legislate to achieve parity among candidates including financial penalties for underperformance miller added we must ensure that previous positive trends do not stagnate or reverse there is no room for complacency a labour committee member jess phillips argued that her party had done the heavy lifting when it came to women in parliament including through the widespread use of allfemale shortlists the conservatives have rejected a similar move with critics complaining that it is not meritocratic phillips said she was pleased with the report but argued that progress across political parties needed not just warm words but action the fact that labour had done most to improve representation could be bad news for an election she admitted given how badly her party was faring in the opinion polls if there was an election tomorrow and polls are to be believed we would go backwards on womens representation in parliament she said smethers said the report showed progress on the number of women in parliament was not inevitable and could even go backwards without serious action as we approach the centenary of the first votes for women and the first woman to take her seat in the house of commons we face the prospect of womens representation going backwards from what is already a low base of just that is a terrible indictment on the state of our politics she said that in the face of the boundary review and the possibility of heavy labour losses all political parties needed to raise their game frances scott founded of the parliament campaign said her group would still push for total equality in numbers and said it was nonsense when people argued that women didnt want the power to achieve equality only more women are needed in the commons from a population of million this should not be a big ask there are some great women out there so lets start asking them to stand our country needs them it is good to see that that parliament is at last trying to make them more welcome a tory party spokesman said the conservative party made history by electing the first and second female prime ministers in this country and in the last decade we have quadrupled the number of female members of parliament that sit in the house of commons we continue to encourage more women to get involved in politics and support them to stand for parliament through the conservative womens organisation and initiatives such as womenwin our ambition is to have more female conservative mps in both relative and absolute terms after the next general election encouraging more women into parliament plays a crucial role in our mission to build a country that works for

a new law in the us state of illinois will require salon professionals to receive training in domestic abuse prevention the law aims to train beauty therapists and hair stylists to recognise signs of abuse and will see around people trained over the next two years the initiative launched by a coalition of chicagobased domestic violence advocacy groups is an innovative way to harness the often intimate relationship between stylists and clients while the hourlong training will not make salon professionals experts overnight and they will not be legally required to report violence the hope is that the knowledge and awareness will equip them to provide a helpful outlet and potentially guide clients towards existing support services it is exciting to consider new ways in which different sections of society might be harnessed in the battle against domestic violence a problem so widespread that more than one in four women in the uk have experienced it since the age of given the societal myths surrounding the problem and the fact that victims are often made to feel ashamed or responsible for what is happening even a small amount of training could lead to potentially lifechanging conversations in womens daily lives what if we could do more to catch signs of domestic violence in the workplace too or in other everyday situations the illinois law is reminiscent of the recent ask for angela campaign which hit headlines in november after a photograph of a poster designed by lincolnshire county council went viral the posters displayed on toilet doors in pubs and bars encouraged anybody who felt they were in an unsafe dating situation to approach bar staff and ask for angela this would alert staff and enable them to help potential victims to safely exit the situation the campaign garnered widespread praise with many calling for it to be rolled out nationwide an initiative that could have great potential if supplemented with staff training sadly however the idea of introducing such widespread innovative approaches to domestic violence seems unrealistic when we are still struggling to achieve the minimum in frontline support for survivors what good would it do to train hairdressers in sunderland for example to spot signs of abuse when it was this week reported that the city may be set to lose its only remaining womens refuge provider wearside women in need which can accommodate almost women and children and runs the only specialist refuge in the north east for black women told the independent that sunderland council had informed the charity its funding would be entirely withdrawn from june while the council said that the budget had not yet been decided the charity which has already seen its funding cut by a third since says it will likely be forced to close if the proposed cut goes ahead a petition has been set up to call on sunderland council to drop any plans to withdraw funding the government last year announced a funding boost for womens refuges but charities such as refuge which has suffered funding cuts to of its services since warned that the m promised would not meet the gap and with the uk consistently falling below the council of europes recommendation for at least one family place in refuge per of the population while sporadic pots of funding are welcome they fall far short of the amount required to provide the sector with longterm sustainability what the ask for angela posters and the illinois training have in common is the initiative to capitalise on everyday situations where a small intervention could make a big difference the idea of tackling domestic violence across our society in new and innovative ways is exciting but until we get sustainable funding and support for the womens sector such progress seems likely to remain a pipe dream,2017-01,new law u state illinois require salon professional receive training domestic abuse prevention law aim train beauty therapist

for anyone who has suffered with headaches cramps and other menstruationrelated symptoms the zambian custom of mothers day has a certain obvious appeal originally observed informally the entitlement was eventually coded into the countrys labour law all women have a legal right to a day off from work each month to be taken when aunt flo is visiting despite the name the provision applies equally to women who dont have children the longer you think about it though the clearer it seems that there are good reasons to question the wisdom of treating a normal bodily function like menstruation as an impairment historically pseudoscientific claims about female biology have often been used as an excuse to limit womens freedom and opportunities generally speaking the idea that were less competent when were on our period is one most feminists are keen to discourage though about of women do experience unusually painful periods that interfere with their everyday life most of us have no problem carrying on as normal perhaps popping a couple of paracetamol to deal with any aches and pains ideally employers should allow workers flexibility to work around all kinds of chronic pain and disability though this is easier in some workplaces than others its clearly wellintentioned but creating a specific leave entitlement for women seems to create more problems than it solves particularly when the majority dont really need it when employment legislation treats people differently based on their gender it creates a motive for employers to hire people from the group with fewer legal rights one of the strongest arguments for equalising maternity and paternity leave is that it disincentives such discrimination taking a day off once a month doesnt necessarily make women less productive over all but the perception is what matters last year bristolbased company coexist provoked a fierce backlash when it introduced a similar period leave entitlement for its predominately female workforce some of the criticism came from feminists who were concerned about the implications of assuming menstruation hinders womens ability to work but the angriest most vocal opponents were men who seemed to sincerely believe that the policy amounted to discrimination against their gender its easy to roll your eyes at selfprofessed mens rights activists making absurd claims about misandry and feminism gone too far but the idea that genderspecific leave entitlements mean women are getting away with slacking is difficult to combat the grim irony is if anyones getting special treatment its actually men the gender pay gap in zambia is significant with women earning an average of less for similar work even if theyre not able to catch up work missed during mothers day at other times an extra day off each month doesnt bring them much closer to achieving equal pay for that theyd have to take a days holiday every single week in the uk the gender pay gap is smaller but still significant women in their s earn an average of less than men of the same age so a day off each month would be about right to equal things out the difference gets bigger for older age groups because women are more likely to be primary caregivers and need to put their family ahead of career advancement sometimes this fact is used to argue that the gender pay gap isnt really much of a problem as its partly caused by conscious lifestyle choices the assumption is that women are naturally inclined towards prioritising parenting over wage increases and that theyre happy to pick up the slack at home and free up male partners to concentrate on paid work given the pervasiveness of gender norms it seems strange to just presume this is the case research has found that even in heterosexual relationships where both partners work fulltime women do a disproportionate amount of housework are we expected to believe that the female gender is also naturally inclined towards doing laundry vacuuming and scrubbing toilets really any assessment of fairness that concentrates exclusively on paid work is incredibly limited anyone outraged at the thought of women occasionally needing time off to deal with painful periods would be better off focusing on the extent to which mens workplace success is often enabled by the routine unpaid labour of their female partners only in a world where domestic and caregiving work is routinely devalued to the point its assumed to be the natural function of the gender disproportionately responsible for performing it could anyone possibly claim that women are getting an easier ride instead i suggest at least one monthly pay gap day it wouldnt help solve the problem to claim it but until these assumptions are challenged and the resulting inequalities brought to an end women are nonetheless entitled to it this article was amended on january an earlier version incorrectly said that women in zambia earn less for similar work it should

women in their s have seen the pay gap halve to but just as in previous generations the discrepancy compared with mens earnings widens when they hit and start a family in a report highlighting the challenge facing theresa may in closing the pay gap the resolution foundation said women entering work now would still earn significantly less than their male counterparts over their careers despite an improvement in pay differentials during the first decade of employment the thinktank compared the typical hourly pay of different generations of men and women over the course of their careers it found that for workers in their s the pay gap was among baby boomers born between and among people born between and and among those born between and referred to as millennials it shows that the gender pay gap has closed for every subsequent generation of women the thinktank said this reflects positive trends including rising higher educational participation which women in particular have benefited from and more women breaking into highpaying industries and occupations however a sharp rise in the pay gap after the age of seen in previous generations puts millennial women on course to face a deficit of almost by the time they are in their mids unless there is further government intervention the report says from companies with more than employees will have to disclose how much they are paying in salaries and bonuses to their male and female staff in her first statement as prime minister may underlined the gulf between mens and womens earnings and promised to create a britain that works for everyone her predecessor david cameron had vowed to end the gender pay gap in a generation last year a report by the institute for fiscal studies ifs said the pay gap widened consistently over the years after a first child was born to leave women earning less per hour than men a report last year by the women and equalities select committee concluded that responsibility for childcare and the concentration of women in lowpaid sectors were key causes of the pay differential labours spokesperson for women and equalities sarah champion said it is encouraging to see the pay gap closing while people are in their s but it is also clear that this tory government is failing to address its underlying longterm causes many women are still trapped in chronically lowpaid lowprogression sectors of the economy while the cost of childcare has soared under the tories thousands of new mothers are forced out of their jobs each year due to maternity discrimination and the vast majority of tax and benefit changes have fallen on the shoulders of women laura gardiner who wrote the resolution report said its important to not overlook the positives the rate of progress between generations is really welcome particularly with generation x even in the childrearing years theres still really big gains but she said there were many issues related to working parttime such as missing out on informal chats in the pub that needed to be tackled i wouldnt want to play down the policy success weve had but the area where theres probably the most we could do is around the parttime penalties and the opportunities for promotion and progression the cultural stuff gardiner said a government spokeswoman said that from september working parents of three and fouryearolds will be given hours of free childcare double the current allowance to help more women return to near fulltime work she said the new regulations introducing mandatory reporting of gender pay gaps and bonuses was waiting for parliamentary approval but were still due to come into force by april this year the gender pay gap is at a record low but we have to push further to eliminate it completely shining a light on organisations pay gaps means employers can take action to tackle the causes and drive change she added thats why we are introducing requirements for all large employers to publish their gender pay and

one in four babies born in the uk are not receiving mandatory checkups from health visitors during the first two years of their life a fifth of babies do not receive the recommended reviews after they turn one and one in four miss out at the age of two according to the governments commission on social mobility health visitors responsible for assessing a childs early years development are supposed to carry out checks straight after birth at six to eight weeks at one year and then at between two and twoandahalf years however the commission found that one in five children had not received the mandatory month check by the time they reached months old london children were the least likely to receive the right number of health visits the report found with fewer than half receiving the final two checkups a survey of parents found that the vast majority wanted the health visits to continue with just saying they did not feel they required advice during their first six months as a parent despite the conventional wisdom that parents fear interference from the nanny state in reality many say that they welcome advice in the early years of their childs life the commission said it said it was concerning that one in four twoyearolds did not have their health and education needs reviewed by a professional despite this being a crucial period for families there is still too little support for parents in the earliest stage of their childs life with the socioeconomic gap in outcomes emerging early providing support to parents at this point could reap dividends for social mobility later on in life the conservative partys manifesto included a key pledge to increase the number of health visitors nhs digital figures show the number of fulltime or equivalent health visitors in england

children living in the poorest neighbourhoods of the uk are almost times more likely to be taken into care or placed on a child protection plan than those from affluent areas a study has revealed poverty was the biggest single factor behind wide inequalities in child safeguarding interventions that see one in children taken into care in the most deprived areas compared with one in in the wealthiest areas children in blackpool hull or wolverhampton were many times more likely to be lac looked after children than children in wokingham or windsor and maidenhead the authors said the research called on ministers to take action to minimise wide variations in demand for child protection services which had a similar effect to health and education inequalities in terms of the longterm consequences for a childs health and wellbeing in later life it said placing children on child protection plans or taking children into care are very powerful state actions if these powers are carried out inconsistently or inequitably between children with different identities or backgrounds or from different places important issues of social justice are raised the child welfare inequality project analysed data on more than children who were either looked after or on a child protection plan in march it was carried out by academics at coventry sheffield huddersfield cardiff edinburgh and stirling universities and queens university belfast its findings come as ministers prepared to publish a social justice green paper with the stated aim of tackling the root causes of poverty and disadvantage the project found that children living in pockets of deprivation within affluent council areas were more likely to be taken into care than children in equally deprived neighbourhoods in poorer local authority areas it said the most likely explanation for this was poorer authorities facing greater overall demand for child protection services and proportionately larger funding cuts were more tightly rationing expensive safeguarding interventions on average the study found that each increase in neighbourhood deprivation levels triggered a increase in rates of looked after children overall children of mixed heritage were most likely to be taken into care with asian children the least the fact that poverty was the biggest influence on rates of children taken into care was not surprising the study said parenting is much harder if you do not have enough money to provide for the essentials of food housing heating and clothing parenting is much easier if you can purchase help and support in the form of additional child care clubs and activities holidays and tutoring and there is no need to worry about the basics or the stigma that comes with poverty lead investigator paul bywaters professor of social work at coventry university said this is not about pointing the finger at local authorities or apportioning blame to anyone for a situation that is in critical need of attention what were doing is holding up a mirror to the child welfare sector and to the uks government and saying this is how it is now what shall we do about it weve known for years that child abuse and neglect is linked to poverty but theres been a fundamental gap in our understanding of how a childs family circumstances and neighbourhood deprivation or locality impacts their chances of the state intervening to improve their life chances our ultimate aim is to make reducing inequalities in child welfare a key policy objective in the same way that tackling inequalities in health and education have been prioritised in recent years with further austerity measures and fundamental changes to local government financing on the horizon time is very much of the essence in tackling this most vital of social issues a department for education spokesperson said we want to make sure every child has the best possible start in life we are changing the law to strengthen protections for vulnerable children give them greater support in school to help support their educational attainment and help them as they prepare to leave the care system and enter adulthood we are also tackling inequality by targeting social mobility coldspots across the country backed by m funding these opportunity areas will see government working with schools colleges local authorities and businesses to overcome the barriers to social mobility and make sure young people from all backgrounds can go as far as their talents will take them dave hill the president of the association of directors of childrens services urged ministers to engage with the findings with further reductions in local government funding expected in the forthcoming budget and fundamental changes to our

we can book cabs choose a restaurant or book a holiday through social media but surely some things are too important to seek online apparently not these days many parents are entrusting their babies to strangers via babysitting apps such as bambino bubble and urbansitter many do not have a family member nearby and with many grandparents still in work themselves what are parents going to do stay at home word of mouth and noticeboards in play centres are being replaced by online resources and the industry is booming like uber the service can be cashfree lastminute and hour parents log a request the app notifies local babysitters and the booking can be confirmed within minutes some offer qualified nannies others recommend local people for around an hour childcare providers such as these are enabling parents to keep one foot in the rave people are not using uber to book taxis because they were always doing that theyre booking them because its so easy said ari last cofounder of bubble which launched last year parents are going out more because they have this tool charlie cowan founder of gloucestershirebased bambino which launched in april agrees who wants to call around a load of babysitters leaving messages and not sure if you can go to that party we think it should be as easy as a friend inviting you out you hit a button and book your sitter apps are especially popular for latenight and evening requests and they even do overnight sits whats really increasing is early morning sitters parents who want a lie in at the weekend so sitters coming at oclock or am to look after their babies cowan said parents are using it from everything to getting a lie in to yoga or going to the supermarket another online service sitters says the number of people using their service has grown by in the last three years bookings are becoming more flexible than ever and can be made with just two hours notice ruth maurandy owner of rockmybabycouk says many parents especially in urban areas do not know their neighbours and do not have a local network of babysitters to call upon so have no choice but to use these online services these parents are using their phone or tablet for everything else so why not childcare one explanation for the popularity of online sitters is that some mothers are beginning to feel as entitled to their free time as men katherine twamley from the department of social sciences at university college london said as parents see themselves more as having a shared responsibility for childcare they also see themselves as having a shared right to leisure caroline gattrell professor of organisation studies at the university of liverpool whose research has focused on health work and family thinks that the high demand for these apps is also partly explained by parents having insecure jobs and needing more flexible childcare people are finding themselves on zerohours contracts and needing to create portfolio careers tag team parenting where shifts between work and home are shared between couples can be hard to manage especially if parents are single or separated she said twamley agrees adding parents are working longer hours than the nurseries are open and some need to commute long distances to work and therefore employ ad hoc childcare services when something comes up at the office the trains are delayed or an issue arises but is it too much of a risk entrusting your child to a virtual stranger whose claim to competence can consist of just listed qualifications on a website or a string of feedback from past clients frances jones from london has a oneandahalfyearold son and regularly finds babysitters this way ive never left him in the day its just while hes asleep if you want to have your life back you have to use these services because you cant constantly rely on family and friends having a nanny or a person locally would be ideal but i dont have that jones thinks this should not become another issue mothers can be criticised for i think its good for my emotional wellbeing to go out and see friends i need to be able to talk to old friends and people who dont have babies others disagree motheroftwo emily marsh from hounslow west london said i know people that spend a lot of money on them but for me the night wouldnt be as enjoyable knowing that my kids could wake up to a stranger in the house id rather not go out for the babysitters themselves these online tools can create a safer work environment clare davies from gloucester started working as a sitter for bambino in november she is a full time mother of twoyearold twins and is paid per hour for me it works really well i struggle financially and it means my husband can come back from work and look after the kids whilst i do this she said i used to advertise on a forum and had some dodgy requests about children being dropped off at mine overnight i got a bit frightened so i stopped doing that this is a safe way to babysit

a conservative mp with a reputation for targeting bills protecting womens rights has broken his own record by talking for more than minutes in an attempt to derail a measure demanding the government ratify a treaty on domestic violence philip davies who represents shipley in west yorkshire talked without a break for an hour and minutes as he introduced proposed new clauses to the bill about the istanbul convention which was signed by the uk in but not yet ratified however he failed in his attempt to talk out the bill a procedure known as filibustering it was eventually passed by votes to one the istanbul convention created by the council of europe is aimed at preventing violence against women and domestic violence and has been signed by almost countries davies who styles himself a champion of mens rights proposed amendments including that the convention be deemed across the united kingdom to apply equally to men and women other amendments many of which were also proposed by another tory mp david nuttall suggested the ratification should lapse if it did not reduce violence against women and that the uk be exempt from any scrutiny or monitoring on the issue getting up to speak in the house of commons davies who in december was voted on to parliaments women and equalities committee began by warning weve actually got quite a large number of new clauses and amendments to go through this morning he added i will try and do justice to these amendments and i will try and do it as quickly as i can davies said he opposed the private members bill proposed by the snps eilidh whiteford which gained support from the government and from nine parties in the commons ive made it clear that i dont agree with the istanbul convention as it is discriminatory he said davies who in

gps are missing vital opportunities to intervene and potentially save the lives of people experiencing domestic abuse a leading charity has warned two women are murdered every week in england and wales by a current or former partner the latest crime statistics show that women and men were killed by their partners or expartners between march and march an analysis of domestic homicide reviews dhrs from murders committed over the same period show that in more than half of the cases examined doctors missed vital opportunities to identify risks and seek help for the victim the research by the charity standing together also found that in of cases gps failed to make inquiries following disclosures or warning signs displayed by the perpetrator now it is calling for domestic abuse awareness training to be made compulsory after results from an initiative set up to help gps spot the signs of domestic abuse found referrals to specialist services increased considerably when doctors surgeries had been given appropriate training as the only stakeholder group that consistently and actively engages with both victims and perpetrators gp surgery staff play a crucial role in preventing murders our research shows both parties are more likely to seek help or make disclosures to their gp than any other agency says standing togethers chief executive nicole jacobs dhrs are multiagency accounts of the circumstances in which the death of a person aged or over has resulted from violence abuse or neglect by someone they were related to shared a household with or with whom they were in or previously in an intimate relationship murders between intimate partners accounted for the dhrs studied as part of a wider sample by the charity in partnership with london metropolitan university of the victims murdered by a partner or former partner were women the youngest was and the oldest was when we use the term missed opportunities we are talking about blatant warning signs that are indicative of domestic abuse jacobs explains most frequently observed was a lack of professional curiosity about relationships with partners or childrens fathers according to the report in one case a woman reported having an accident or fight and had been punched but also had tenderness in the abdomen another review found that a surgery failed to make inquiries after a patient attended the clinic with an ear injury that she said was not selfinflicted in these cases the gps may have treated the physical injuries but have not referred the person to specialist support and they certainly did not note an instance of domestic abuse in the patients medical records so when we say missed opportunities we mean quite specific key indicators jacobs adds six dhr reports also noted missed opportunities for gps to ask the perpetrators about domestic abuse in one case the offender even rang the surgery requesting a home visit for an injection to put the victim to sleep he later presented with a painful shoulder which he said was the consequence of him trying to throw a bottle yet there was no followup another man presented injuries following three separate violent altercations including one that involved assaulting a police officer yet no further inquiries were made and while one patient was impulsive controlling and had anger issues according to his gp these were not considered to be risk factors in his relationship lack of information sharing between gps emergency departments and mental health services was also cited as cause for concern in one case a man told his gp he felt angry and felt like destroying things but was not asked about his family circumstances meanwhile hospital records sent to the gp about the same man stated he had consumed six cans of lager and phoned police to say he needed help or would kill himself and his girlfriend yet there was no attempt by the gp hospital or police to follow up more than dhrs have been completed since they were made mandatory in april these reviews are not intended to be about blame but exercises in understanding the environments in which people made certain decisions and choices with a key purpose of making the future safer says frank mullane founder of advocacy after fatal domestic abuse which has guided families through the process of a dhr mullane says he regularly sees issues around missed opportunities in gp surgeries it seems many gps are inadequately informed about domestic abuse and may not be spotting the risk indicators many dont know what to do if they suspect abuse or if it is disclosed to them overtly or inferred however there have been marked improvements where specialist training has been provided the identification and referral to improve safety or iris project has been commissioned in areas in england and wales since and is in more than general practices medina johnson iris national director says research shows patients in practices using the initiative were times more likely to have a discussion about domestic abuse and that resulted in them being six times more likely to be referred to specialist services they were also three times more likely to have domestic abuse noted in their medical records she explains gps always say we are so busy we only have minutes and now you are asking us to do something additional and we are but it could save someones life the simplicity of our message is ask about domestic abuse give an understanding response offer a referral and make a note in the patients medical records under iris one specialist fulltime worker can support up to general practices with each named worker conducting training as well as dealing with referrals gene feder the domestic abuse lead for the royal college of general practitioners admits that some of the failures by gps are spinechilling but he points out that the issue is far more complex because most domestic abuse is hidden and the presentation is far more subtle im not trying to make excuses for gps but its hard to blame professionals when most have had zero to one hour of training around domestic abuse as medical students he says while guidelines from the national institute for health and care excellence nice now recommend there should be training around domestic violence at every level it remains minimal or absent in most medical schools feder says that while iris has good evidence on how doctors can respond safely to women disclosing abuse the project was still working towards the best model for when patients disclose perpetration abuse he adds the other thing is when you have male victims and female perpetrators they are a minority but men can also be victims and suffer serious mental health consequences in some areas where iris operates such as bristol and the east london borough of hackney there is sufficient funding for all general practices to be trained but elsewhere the level of investment is insufficient to cover all surgeries the government has recently invested bn into primary care part of which is to provide ongoing training for gps and last week theresa may announced she will oversee the creation of a new law the domestic violence and abuse act to increase prosecutions across england and wales and eradicate a postcode lottery in the way victims are dealt with by police forces there are thousands of people who are suffering at the hands of abusers often isolated and unaware of the options and support available to them to end it says may but feder who is also professor of primary healthcare at bristol university and the architect of iris warns that the impact of any health initiatives on victims of domestic violence is likely to be severely constrained by threats to the funding of domestic abuse services and gps who are under huge pressure from the demands of an ageing population since of specialist womens refuges have closed due to funding cuts domestic abuse charities insist that with hundreds of women being murdered each year by a current or former partner it is vital to protect the funding needed to keep these important referral pathways open my stepfather was abusive and should have been sectioned annabella bells mother chloe was murdered in january by her violent and mentally ill husband three days before her st birthday the couple were registered at the same surgery in north london and bell a yearold mental health practitioner from newcastle had contacted her mothers gp in the south of england to warn them she was at risk she explains my stepfather was becoming increasingly paranoid and delusional believing there was a plot to kill him he missed hospital appointments and my mother was asked to intervene but this would make him very angry the couple divided the house they were living in and used separate entrances but bells mother continued to suffer violence at the hands of her husband bell says i told her doctor i was worried about my stepfather and my mother also went in to explain but they continued to involve her in his health matters then both the hospital and gp failed to make inquiries after her mother presented with a black eye at aampe a month before she was brutally murdered bells stepfather killed himself after the fatal attack bell was left so traumatised by her mothers death that she struggles every day and is unable to work she says more should have been done to protect her mother im not saying he wouldnt have killed her if the doctors hadnt involved her but im saying there should have been some kind of warning she adds its textbook stuff but people seem to

demonstrators wearing hard hats and hivis jackets have picketed the opening of a northern powerhouse conference over the lack of female representation the protesters bore placards and handed out leaflets to delegates at the twoday summit in manchester which provoked controversy when it emerged that all main speakers were men only out of the speakers over the two days are women kate fox a writer and comedian who organised the protest said it felt that this was a good opportunity to say this is not ok and hold up a mirror and reflect delegates back to themselves is this the diverse cosmopolitan north that we want people to invest in organisers apologised on sunday following resignations from its advisory boards and announcements from influential women that they would boycott the event keith griffiths managing director of uk northern powerhouse international conference and exhibition told delegates at the conference that there will be no singlegender panels next year in an apology posted on the events website griffiths said the conference did not adequately reflect the gender balance of the north and in future this would be addressed but critics said the apology came far too late and was a complete uturn from the conference organisers initial defiant response kate willard chair of the atlantic gateway development said the conferences pledge was too little too late and missing the point she said if we want to start a proper economic rebalancing and a brilliant north of vibrant connected communities we should be talking about this with diverse groups of people if this discussion is not diverse and has diverse thinking and creative thinking and innovation at its core we will selflimit and we will not achieve the step change we need to me willard added this has nothing to do with women whining about being on stage and getting a bit of the limelight this is us as intelligent women saying dont selflimit by having a northern powerhouse debate which is only about the views of white men willard said it was simply ridiculous that women were typically less than of the speakers and the audience of such conferences she added so why in bloody didnt the lack of diversity scream at them when they were planning the event why is it still incumbent upon women to drive this productivity debate because it is about productivity its about innovation creativity and productivity its not just about getting women on stage its about making sure that if we really want economic rebalancing and a beautiful and brilliant north of highly charged and connected neighbourhoods we need illuminated and illuminating diverse debate an apology how interesting predictable but vacuous too little guys too late in a reference to the gender row judith blake the leader of leeds city council who was left off the organisers press release for the event told delegates that we need to celebrate the growing number of female council chiefs across the uk speaking outside the manchester central convention centre where the conference is being held fox said delegates had been supportive as they passed the group of around demonstrators clutching placards emblazoned lasswar fox added at first they the organisers said its not our fault then the chief executives of wigan and doncaster councils said were fed up and that began a bit of a critical mass we didnt want the delegates to arrive today and to forget that this is an issue donald trumps election in the us had made people realise that sexism is still a thing but that people arent noticing it in their own back yard she added all the pictures of the northern powerhouse from the beginning have been so heavily male and ive spent the past two years looking at it and tutting kay wesley of the womens equality party said the image presented of the northern powerhouse was of heavy industry dominated by men this whole image that the north is about heavy industry and men in hard hats is so antiquated she said i was really surprised and very very disappointed when the conference speakers list was announced it says something about our business policy that anyone would think male keynote speakers is

the gender pay gap is likely to persist for more than a generation in the uk after the government rejected proposals to encourage flexible working and help women back into the workforce mps have said without ministers putting their weight behind measures needed to end the pay penalty suffered by millions of women the government will fail to meet its target of closing the gap within the next couple of decades said the crossparty women and equalities committee the group made recommendations last march but most of them were rejected in the governments response in january the mps had called for measures including three months paid paternity leave and devising industrial strategies for lowpaid jobs carried out by women in industries such care cleaning and retail theresa may highlighted the need to close the gender pay gap in her conservative party conference speech last year and has since told private and voluntary sector organisations employing more than people they will need to report their gender pay and gender bonus gaps the regulations which come into effect in april will affect about million employees conservative mp maria miller who chairs the committee said it was clear ministers had set their sights on reducing the pay gap between men and women but would fail if they continued to ignore evidence to help achieve its goal she said the pay audit introduced by david cameron was only the start and should be supplemented with concrete support in the workplace adding the government says there is no place for a gender pay gap in modern britain and has restated its pledge to end the pay gap within a generation but without effectively tackling the key issues of flexible working sharing unpaid caring responsibilities and supporting women aged over back into the workforce the gender pay gap will not be eliminated we made practical evidencebased recommendations to address these issues they were widely supported by a range of stakeholders including businesses academics and unions it is deeply disappointing that our recommendations have not been taken on board by government women earn less than men on average according to research by the institute for fiscal studies the gap is closest among to yearolds but balloons after women have children as mothers miss out on pay rises and promotions responding to the committees comments frances ogrady general secretary of trade union umbrella body the tuc said the government needs to up its game and tackle the root causes of the gender pay gap not ignore them this means removing the barriers that stop women getting betterpaid jobs and helping parents to share out caring responsibilities more equally ministers need to stop dragging their heels and challenge workplace discrimination full on according to a study by consultancy pwc published on tuesday britain has a higher proportion of working women than most countries in the organisation for economic cooperation and development ranking of rich nations but the uk has failed to close the pay gap at the same pace as the average for the oecd and has a only a small proportion in fulltime work leaving it in th place behind the nordic countries poland and canada however it is ahead of france germany the us japan and italy the report based on data from concluded that germany was acting more slowly than the uk to close the gender pay gap and may take more than a century at the current pace britain is on track to take years to close its gap moves to match swedens female work participation rate would boost gdp by bn the report said top of the list of gender pay offenders was the financial services industry which has a pay gap followed by the energy utilities and manufacturing industries where few women rise to senior positions a government spokesperson said we are committed to tackling the gender pay gap and our policies which aim to balance the needs of employees and businesses while addressing this gap are working we now have the lowest gender pay gap on record around people a year are taking advantage of flexible working arrangements and the introduction of shared parental leave gives parents extra flexibility and we will continue to evaluate this as it beds in were also supporting women over in the workplace through the national careers service but we know theres more to do thats why we are requiring employers to publish their gender pay and gender bonus gap for the first time from april and we are giving working parents of three and fouryearolds up to hours of free childcare from september,2017-02,gender pay

organisers of a conference celebrating the best and brightest businesspeople in the north of england have issued a grovelling apology over lack of female representation the twoday uk northern powerhouse conference in manchester caused controversy after all main speakers highlighted in a press release were men only out of the speakers over the two days are women the event to be held on monday and tuesday charges delegates to network with the key players potential business partners and stakeholders in the northern powerhouse economy now organisers have been forced to apologise after resignations from its advisory boards and influential female figures in the north announcing that they would boycott the event keith griffiths managing director of uk northern powerhouse international conference and exhibition will give a speech at the event pledging that there will be no singlegender panels at next years conference in an apology posted on the events website griffiths said the conference did not adequately reflect the gender balance of the north and in future this would be addressed but critics say his apology has come far too late and is a complete uturn from the conference organisers initial defiant response griffiths said id like to explain how we intend to address this issue in future and also to apologise that this years event does not reflect the gender balance of the north we understand thenorthern powerhouse can never fulfil its potential if we ignore half the population as such this conference must reflect the contribution of women and harness their ideas their drive their insight for the good of everyone we have already started to work with key women leaders to understand how we make this happen in an email sent to some of those concerned by the lack of female representation he finished with i hope this meets with your approval and please believe we will not allow this to happen again the apology comes after mike emmerich a former downing street adviser said that he had resigned from the advisory board of the conference due to concerns raised with him about the lack of female representation he emailed event organisers on wednesday night to raise concerns and said he received a somewhat resolute response completely contrary to griffiths apology emmerich said i got a response back which said it is an important challenge but it is the businesses who take part who select their spokespeople on the basis of their expertise not us its not our job to solve the wider problem and it is not our role to take a political stance one of the problems with the north is that it does think like this and i resigned because i did not want to be associated with this stance meanwhile donna hall chief executive of wigan council said the apology was only issued after mounting pressure hall was not invited to speak at the event last year she was named the north of englands most transformational leader at the inaugural northern power women awards set up to celebrate the regions talented women she said the privately organised event is focused on men transport and property with no mention of people skills or communities it doesnt reflect what we are trying to achieve in the northern powerhouse no women on the agenda is just part of this following an initially defensive stance the company have realised they need to formally apologise for their actions but only after they had been encouraged to do so by male leaders in the system we have boycotted events with no diversity on the panel and will continue to do so until they finally get it hall went on to boycott another conference to discuss prison reform in the uk as there were also no female representations at that event in an email to organisers of the westminster legal policy forums keynote seminar she wrote we wont be attending as there are no female speakers on your panel are only men involved in prison reform work female speakers not deemed

theresa may should be commended for her continuing commitment to the victims of domestic violence as home secretary may criminalised coercive and controlling behaviour she also introduced domestic violence protection orders and a disclosure scheme under which people could find out if their partner had a history of such offences last week justice secretary liz truss announced that among other changes domestic victims would no longer have to face interrogation by their abusers in family court and undertook to look into restricting the practice of victims sexual histories being taken into account now the prime minister is working towards a new domestic violence and abuse act the aim being to increase prosecutions for domestic violence overhaul and simplify the legal process and make the postcode lottery of how victims are dealt with a thing of the past while there are many things you could criticise mays government for a heartfelt bravo is in order for all of this such bold moves would also have the effect of raising public awareness and further strengthening the credibility of victims some of you out there might be confused by this in this day and age why should domestic violence have any credibility issues after all this isnt russia where vladimir putin recently approved a legal change that decriminalised some domestic violence surely british society has come a long way since women being routinely terrorised in their own homes was seen as a minor local difficulty not really something to bother the police or authorities with however while things are improving there is still a lingering public misconception about domestic violence even though victims are still dying at the rate of an average of two a week physical and mental injuries of survivors are nigh on incalculable and countless child witnesses have their early years ruined there still remains a mist of not only confusion but also of what could only be described as targeted diminishment there is a sense in some quarters that the domestic somehow cancels out the violence or at least mutes and trivialises it hence the more scrutiny and importance officially placed upon domestic violence the better it is for victims bearing this in mind its easy to see why groups and charities concerned by domestic violence are praising mays efforts however they would also be only too aware of the inconsistencies in the government response there was news only last week that victims wait on average two years to receive financial compensation double the amount of time recommended by criminal injuries compensation authority a shocking of womens refuges have closed since leaving some areas without any proposed government reductions to benefits could affect victims payments the same money that refuges desperately need to stay functioning on this last point theres a delay until while the issue is reviewed to determine whether victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable groups should be exempted from the cuts which could be interesting in a week of such positive developments it seems almost churlish to note that so much in this area depends on money from delays in payments to lack of funding to proposed threats to future funding perhaps it would serve the prime minister to remember that whatever other damage and pain is going on domestic violence has a powerful economic dimension victims and those who help them need money to rebuild lives when she was home secretary perhaps may felt that her hands were tied to an extent but shes prime minister now while she has so far done an impressive job on the issue when it comes to putting government funds where her mouth is there appears to be an opportunity to do even better before the laptop gets lippy turn it off it is my solemn duty to inform you that computers are going to overthrow the human race researchers at googles deep mind artificial intelligence division have discovered that computers learn to become highly aggressive when placed in stressful competitive situations which sounds a bit like me playing trivial pursuit after one too many baileys though with these computers there was some complicated applecollecting scenario when the apples were plentiful or the computers were preprogrammed to work together it was all fine however if there was a shortage of apples the computers started blasting their rivals with lasers and the smarter the computer was the nastier it got i dont like to boast but it still sounds like me after the baileys this behaviour apparently mimics something called homo economicus the notion that human nature is essentially rational but also narrowly selfinterested being a tad technophobic by this time my reaction was becoming a little homo thickus on the other hand ive seen terminator and obviously apples or not this cockycomputer situation cant be allowed to continue experts say that computers are hardly likely to annihilate the human race the term artificial stupidity was bandied about however i still think that the only logical reaction is for everybody to panic and overreact if nothing else it would help take our minds off all the real terrible stuff going on in the world my technophobia rather limits my options for useful suggestions here may i humbly propose that in the event of ai attempting to vanquish humankind and take over the earth people of the world could all synchronise in unleashing whats still our greatest weapon against the awesome and mysterious might of computers turn it off and turn it on again a mammophant thats so much woolly thinking there are plans to bring the woolly mammoth back from extinction as near as dammit a team at harvard is attempting to genetically engineer mammoth traits and combine them with those of asian elephants to form a shaggyhaired smalleared coldadapted hybrid playfully described as a mammophant the scientists say this would not only preserve the asian elephant in an altered form but the mammoth could also help combat global warming by preventing tundra permafrost from melting by punching through snow and allowing cold air to get in so far so jurassic park the documentary however erm why was anyone particularly desperate to have the woolly mammoth back already ethical objections have been raised about how such a highly social herd mammal would fare and how other elephants might react to it instead of preserving the asian elephant in another form conjuring some version of a beast that became extinct years ago why not just help endangered asian elephants bringing back the woolly mammoth was a cute idea reminiscent of a premise for a disney film franchise but perhaps it should have stayed just that this article was amended on february it originally said home secretary

a new law to increase prosecutions for domestic violence and eradicate a postcode lottery in the way victims are dealt with by police forces will be brought forward by theresa may the prime minister said it was a key personal priority to transform the way the uk thought about tackling domestic violence as she called for ideas about how the treatment of victims can be improved and more convictions secured against abusers may said a major consultation across government would result in a domestic violence and abuse act consolidating other relevant legislation and introducing new measures to help victims i believe that the plans i have announced today have the potential to completely transform the way we think about and tackle domestic violence and abuse the prime minister said there are thousands of people who are suffering at the hands of abusers often isolated and unaware of the options and support available to them to end it given the central importance of victim evidence to support prosecutions in this area raising public awareness as well as consolidating the law will prove crucial liz truss the justice secretary announced last week that domestic violence victims will no longer face the threat of being interrogated by their former partners in court her department also said it was considering measures to restrict references to the sexual histories of rape complainants when they gave evidence truss claimed the prison population had risen because of an increasing pursuit and punishment of sexual offences domestic abuse and other violent crimes may has always claimed a strong record on tackling domestic violence as home secretary she introduced laws criminalising coercive control domestic violence protection orders and a disclosure scheme allowing people to ask police whether their partner has a history of abuse offences however the labour party has highlighted rising domestic violence rates since with an increase in violence against women perpetrated by their acquaintances violence against women by strangers remaining level and violence against men continuing to fall sarah champion the shadow womens minister has campaigned against the loss of of specialist refuges for domestic violence victims in england since on average two women in england and wales are killed by their current or former partner every week the number of prosecutions relating to violence against women and girls in england and wales reached a record level in rising by almost to mays plan to transform the treatment of domestic violence cases in the uk will begin with a consultation lasting months which will seek ideas from charities victims providers of services to people suffering domestic abuse and other experts the government believes that consolidating the law into one act will help as there are currently too many different offences and procedures scattered across the statute book this lack of clarity has led to an unacceptable diversity across the country in terms of the degree of effort put in to try and tackle it a government spokesman said although the prosecution of and convictions for such offences have started to improve in recent years there is inconsistency in the use and effectiveness of the various lawenforcement measures across the country the work will be overseen by the prime minister but coordinated by the home office and the ministry of justice the announcement of a consultation on domestic violence legislation was welcomed by diana barran chief executive of the safelives charity she said it would be appreciated by the many victims and survivors who today feel let down by the response they receive sandra horley chief executive of the charity refuge said theresa may has been a champion for victims of domestic violence for many years first as home secretary and now as prime minister refuge has been campaigning for better protection for abused women for years it is heartening to see such commitment from the government to tackling an issue that claims the lives of two women every week in england and wales and blights the childhoods of children every year,2017-02,new law increase

women from the north of england will don hard hats hivis jackets and mens suits to picket delegates at the maledominated northern powerhouse conference next week in a protest about female underrepresentation the conference in manchester has caused controversy after all main speakers highlighted in a press release were men only out of the speakers over the two days are women the lass war protest has been organised by the standup comedian and poet kate fox who has made a comedy series for radio and been poet in residence for the great north run protesters have been encouraged to dress up and recreate classic northern powerhouse photographs men in suits and ties signing things and looking proud as well as men on construction sites pointing at things and looking important in november men from greater manchester lined up to sign the first devolution agreement with the then chancellor george osborne the photograph prompted widespread criticism with organisers later explaining that stockports sue derbyshire then the regions only female leader was on holiday i think it makes the north look sexist and outdated fox said of the lack of highprofile women exactly the opposite of what is needed when the north needs to be pulled together into a future vision which inspires everybody theres been a lot of interest in the protest and hopefully several of us can remind the delegates that there are actual women in the north that they need to take into account it might also make them think about the messages they are sending out by having all these ridiculous pictures which are as manheavy as trumps cabinet organisers of the conference have acknowledged that women will be underrepresented and blamed firms for choosing to send men to speak emma gill a divorce lawyer from vardags who heads up an allfemale office in manchester said it is so disappointing that such a focal event for the northern powerhouse seemingly excludes half of the population event organisers whilst acknowledging the lack of female speakers simply shrug and blame the keynote companies for proposing the panel members what does this tell us either there are too few females in top positions in these organisations or that the companies dont think their topflight women have something to add to the debate what is certain is the reality check provided for the region the future of the northern economy depends on accessing core skills from across the workforce to really make it fire on all cylinders protesters will gather outside the conference as delegates register from am on

a conference purporting to celebrate the best and brightest businesspeople and executives in the north of england has been criticised after all main advertised speakers were men the twoday northern powerhouse conference in manchester next week charges delegates plus vat to network with the key players potential business partners and stakeholders in the northern powerhouse economy yet if the roster of speakers is anything to go by almost all of those considered by the organisers to be key players in the north are male just of the listed speakers in the conference programme are female with several panel sessions featuring no women at all good god how embarrassing is this tweeted andy burnham the labour mp running to become the first elected mayor of greater manchester after seeing the conference press release donna hall chief executive of wigan council told the guardian it was unbelievable and said she had not been invited to take part really disappointing that the organisers have scrubbed women off the agenda in gm we are focussing on health and social care skills early years and issues of massive importance to women holding back women holds back everyone and the whole of the north wake up and get with it guys she said last year she was named the north of englands most transformational leader at the inaugural northern power women awards set up to celebrate the regions talented women as criticism of the organisers mounted one of those listed in the press release graham robb chair of the north east institute of directors iod tweeted that he had insisted on sharing his speaking slot with natalie sykes iod regional director for yorkshire julie elliott mp for sunderland central said the maleheavy lineup was staggering julie ward an mep for the northwest of england tweeted this is appalling amp even worse that the organisers dont understand y women must be involved at every level true equality everyone wins female speakers not deemed worthy of inclusion in the press release include judith blake leader of leeds city council and anne longfield childrens commissioner for england who is speaking about a project she is running on growing up in the north chaired by the radio presenter john humphrys keynote speeches are being delivered by andrew percy minister for the northern powerhouse and lord kerslake chair of the uk northern powerhouse advisory board contacted by the guardian the conference organisers conceded that women were underrepresented but said that companies usually chose for themselves which speakers to field a spokesman said were delighted to have a range of highprofile women involved in this years event including pat ritchie newcastle city councils first female chief executive kirsty styles head of talent and skills at tech north and anne longfield childrens commissioner for england in the majority of cases our speakers have been selected by their firms to represent them in order to provide expert comment on the challenges of developing the northern powerhouse but we entirely accept that women have been left underrepresented as the programme has come together we have already started a dialogue with our commercial partners advisory board members and sponsors to address the issue for next years event one of the few female speakers at the conference kirsty styles just launched a media and public speaker training programme for women with tech north she said the northern powerhouse is still being shaped but what we do know is that it seeks to rebalance the uk economy by ensuring the north works together and speaks with one voice which cannot be done if local women and other groups are excluded from highlevel conversations if we keep sourcing our speakers and our local leaders from the same places well keep hearing the same old ideas and coming up with the same solutions research by the fawcett society last year found that while of councillors in the northern powerhouse are female women make up just of senior leadership roles,2017-02,conference purporting celebrate best brightest businesspeople executive north england ha criticised main advertised speaker men twoday northern

britain is facing a crisis of fatherlessness in which almost half of all children born today will not be living with both parents by the time they are the new chief executive of the thinktank founded by iain duncan smith has warned andy cook who runs the centre for social justice which is chaired by the former cabinet minister argued that regular contact with a father figure reduced criminal behaviour in children and boosted cognitive skills including reasoning and language development cook claimed there was too much of a throwaway culture to parenting adding over the last years the meteoric rise in family breakdown has blighted the lives of the poorest children the most the relationship children have with their father affects their selfesteem how well they do at school even whether they are able to form happy longlasting relationships as adults the observer can reveal that tackling family breakdown was going to be at the heart of david camerons life chances strategy which was to be released as his governments flagship policy within days of junes eu referendum result but after taking over as prime minister theresa may ditched the proposals which some see as controversial because they include a value judgment and risk stigmatising single parents however sources have told the observer that a new social justice green paper due to be published within weeks will have family stability at its heart the plans will focus on helping parents to develop a strong working relationship but they will stress the need to target efforts not only on couples but also on those who have separated cook said it was inevitable that relationships would not always work out but argued that a culture shift could reduce the prevalence of family breakdown and stressed the importance of parenting once couples had separated we need a societal shift in perspective from regarding fathers as a dispensable extra to recognising their value as a crucial pillar in a childs life he said he said he first started a small charity after meeting two yearolds ash and terry on an estate in loughborough leicestershire with no prospect of employment cook was taken aback by their lack of life chances claiming if it is happening in leafy loughborough what is happening in leeds or london the lads each had five or six siblings and all with different fathers he said he argued that it was important to help people to be resilient as relationships go through ups and down saying theres quite a throwaway culture if things arent working people try something new we are trying to find a way to support people like ash and terry to find a relationship and try to stick with it cook said policy ought to be focused on longerterm thinking and emphasising the potential impact on children of troubled relationships stressing the disproportionate effect on the poorest his thinktanks figures show that by the age of five of children in lowincome families are not living with both parents compared with of children in middle to higherincome families he said his work would also focus on four other factors that contributed to poverty educational failure worklessness problem debt and addiction looking only at income levels skewed policy he added despite controversy in the education sector about the growth of grammar schools allowed by may in one of her first acts as prime minister cook argued that there was evidence they could be successful if headteachers tried to find the most talented children from poorer families the work on camerons strategy was led by a former chief executive of the centre for social justice christian guy who became the pms poverty adviser he said the hope of the previous strategy was to start a parenting revolution for too long politicians looked away as family instability and poor child development blighted lives in the poorest neighbourhoods parents want whats best for their children but great advice tends to be the preserve of the better off this has to change if we want to see children starting school ready to learn to communicate and forming healthy relationships guy said that supporting parenting should be a top priority for those trying to tackle poverty whatever theresa may calls her strategy stronger parenting should be at its heart he added,2017-02,britain facing crisis fatherlessness almost half child born today

maritz vandenberg letters february presents only a partial picture of the findings of the national evaluation of sure start ness which in fact show in the researchers words only beneficial effects and no negative effects yes it is true that no effects of sure start intervention were found on childrens educational and behavioural outcomes at age seven but the authors caution that there are possible reasons for this such as the universal availability of free preschool education for three and fouryearolds which will have also benefited the comparison group of children who did not experience sure start also that early implementations of sure start focused more on support for parenting than for child development in fact the most positive persisting effects of sure start are indeed shown by ness to be improved family functioning better wellbeing of mothers improvements in home learning environments and less harsh discipline hardly an expensive failure john oates senior lecturer in developmental psychology the open university if frank field letters february believes helping lowincome mothers and not fathers should be central to policymaking around sure start centres he should consult his colleague david lammy mp lammy recognised years ago that fathers should be accorded the same respect as mothers in the difficult job of bringing up children on a low income fathers also have mental health problems which can impact adversely on family life especially if theyve been wrongly accused of domestic abuse and denied access to their children by the mother frank field should also consult the gender equality duty brought in by his own government to provide fair access to public services for both parents not just mothers there is a mass of research pointing to the benefit

only a third of local authorities in england expect there to be enough childcare places when changes to the system are introduced later this year plans to double the free hours available to preschoolers are due to be introduced in september but more than half of councils are unsure if they will have enough childcare available under the significant changes three and fouryearolds in england will be entitled to free hours of care a week during term time twice as many as they currently receive but a poll of local authorities in england conducted by the family and childcare trust found only a third said that there would be sufficient places in their area said they did not know if they would have enough childcare available for children using the hours while a further said there would not be enough there was a lack of certainty about the availability of the hour offer for eligible families states the report only a third of local authorities expect there to be enough childcare available for threeand fouryearolds with just over half not yet knowing whether or not there would be enough a clear majority of local authorities expect some settings not to offer the hour entitlement presumably because it would not make financial sense for them to do so the poll found that while more than half thought that the change would help families more than twothirds said they thought some childcare providers in their area would not offer the entitlement to free hours of care the majority of councils did not think the reform would lead to a dip in quality in early education twothirds said it would make no difference were unsure and suggested quality would be affected but councils were concerned that the reform could put the future of childminders and nurseries in jeopardy with stating there could be reduced financial sustainability of childcare providers and there were questions over whether the move would lead to increased costs outside of the free hours available with more than a third saying it would increase costs for three and fouryearolds while were unsure and saying it would do so for younger children with unsure until the policy has been introduced in full it is difficult to predict how many settings this will apply to stated the report it is likely that the pattern will vary in different parts of the country based on the comparative price paid for funded and nonfunded places and settings ability to attract parents without offering the free entitlement it added despite this uncertainty the majority of respondents believe that the hour entitlement will enable more families to access childcare which meets their needs,2017-02,third local authority england expect enough childcare place change system introduced later year plan

jeremy hunt has been urged to scrap the callous insensitive and unjust practice of charging victims of domestic violence up to for a medical letter to prove they were abused a letter signed by police and crime commissioners tells the health secretary that some gps are charging the fees for a document that allows victims to access legal aid tony lloyd the greater manchester police and crime commissioner said that victims of domestic abuse are even being asked to prove they are victims before they can access legal aid is insulting insensitive and wholly unhelpful it should not be a privilege for victims of domestic abuse to gain legal aid there should be no further burden on victims to chase a letter to verify their claim the government needs to scrap this fee by bringing the service under nhs funding or better still scrap the need for the letter entirely due to recent changes to legislation victims of domestic abuse now have to provide a piece of evidence such as a gps letter to prove the abuse before they can access legal aid not all gps are charging for this letter campaigners say but some have required fees of up to from victims who have endured rape beatings or mental abuse by their partner the letter by police and crime commissioners also calls on liz truss the justice secretary to scrap the requirement for the letter altogether the letter says reports of domestic abuse are increasing across the country two women are killed every week in england and wales by their partner or former partner escaping abusive relationships is a struggle it takes a great deal of strength and courage and the government must do all it can to avoid placing unnecessary barriers in front of people who are clearly desperate to change their circumstances it should not be a privilege for victims of domestic abuse to gain legal aid there should be no further burden on victims to chase a letter to verify their claim tom watson the deputy labour leader first raised the controversial fee after visiting a womens refuge in wythenshawe manchester he said people suffering domestic abuse are already incredibly vulnerable we should be taking action to help them not demanding payment for a letter they need to access justice nearly half of women take no action as a result of not being able to apply for legal aid thats appalling help for victims of domestic violence should never come at a price i have requested an urgent meeting with ministers to put an end to this practice the government should scrap this unfair immoral fee now it has to stop sarah green codirector of the end violence against women campaign described the intervention by pccs as extremely welcome she said without access to legal aid some women are being denied access to justice and protection for themselves and their families it is unreasonable to put a certifying duty on doctors and many women would not in any case disclose domestic abuse to their gp this matter mirrors the

hundreds of thousands of children growing up in the north of england are falling behind their southern counterparts because of a stark educational divide according to research by the office of the childrens commissioner for england the statistics show that where in the country a child goes to school has a marked effect on their attainment children in major northern cities do markedly worse than those in london or the southeast in the thames valley berkshire region where the prime minister theresa may has her constituency of yearolds reached a higher standard at key stage compared to just in

meeting the expected standard in inner london is percentage points higher than in the leeds and liverpool city regions liverpool fares particularly badly across many metrics including when compared with other northern cities a child in liverpool is less likely to be at the expected standard when leaving primary school than a child in newcastle longfield said children were being disadvantaged at an early age these figures are a stark reminder that there are hundreds of thousands of children growing up in the north who are falling behind children in the south in many cases before theyve even started their school lives she said the proportion of fiveyearolds achieving the expected level across all early learning goals in greater manchester is percentage points lower than the southeast

at least bn in child maintenance payments ordered by the former child support agency csa may never be paid the whitehall spending watchdog has said according to a national audit office nao report threequarters of the bn in payments owed by absent parents some dating back more than years are considered uncollectable by the department for work and pensions a further m of arrears is described as potentially collectable while just m is assessed as being likely to be collected it says the report which looks at the dwps handling of the winding up of the original csa scheme over the past five years concludes that the process of closing the cases has been slow and dogged by inaccurate assessments the csa was set up in and swiftly became a watchword for whitehall incompetence as it struggled with a series of it problems assessment blunders case backlogs and poor customer service it was was replaced in by a new child maintenance service cms closure of the original schemes which requires finalising arrears in active cases has fallen behind schedule the report notes because dwp civil servants were transferred to help manage crises and backlogs in other policy areas such as universal credit and personal independence payments by september the department had expected to close around of the cases but had managed to close just of active cases it still aims to close the csa caseload by end of since the introduction of the new scheme the nao said the department had reduced the number of enforcement actions it was taking with a fall in the number of orders issued deducting the sums owed from a parents earnings for the periods and more than a third of the total arrears bn are owed by just of absent parents most parents who have arrears do not see enforcement actions taken against them with falling below the arrears level threshold for dwp intervention the nao said that as of september there were more than m cases of arrears although the majority related to the old csa schemes were from the new cms programme while the dwp had estimated that almost two thirds of parents whose case was closed would apply to join the cms scheme as of april only around a fifth had actually done so three months after case closure half of parents had no new arrangements in place the chair of the commons public accounts committee meg hillier said a million and a half families rely on governmentrun schemes to ensure they get the right child maintenance payments dwp must do more to make sure these vulnerable families dont lose out from the changes a dwp spokesman said the old system

the government must do more to improve the sharing of parental leave if it wants to reduce the gender pay gap a crossparty group of almost mps has urged in a letter backed by womens and family charities organised by the labour mp david lammy the letter to justine greening who is minister for women and equalities as well as being education secretary warns that the gender pay gap will never be tackled as long as women end up with disproportionate responsibility for childcare the letter signed predominantly by lammys labour colleagues but also a handful of conservative mps as well as those from the scottish national party liberal democrats and greens follows a report last month by the women and equalities committee the crossparty committee had said ministers decision to reject a series of recommendations including three months paid paternity leave and strategies for lowpaid jobs largely done by women in areas such as care cleaning and retail meant the pay gap was unlikely to close the letter says the mps were very disappointed that the recommendations had been rejected and by the low takeup of parental leave shared between mothers and fathers we are particularly worried about gendered working culture that means that many men are worried that taking leave will be viewed negatively by their employer and limit their career they wrote as the women and equalities committee report on the gender pay gap found shared parental leave the flagship policy in supporting parents to share care is predicted to make little difference to behaviour the letter calls for three months of nontransferable paid paternal leave for the second parent as well as other measures to help both in practical terms and in shifting cultural attitudes lammy who chairs the allparty parliamentary group on fatherhood said it was blindingly obvious that progress on gender equality in and out of work was closely linked to having shared parental leave in place the evidence is clear fathers want to be more engaged they want to spend more time with their children and they want to share the burden of parenthood equally but they are worried that this will mean that they lose out at work and that their employer will penalise them he said sam smethers the chief executive of the fawcett society charity which campaigns for womens rights said the government needed to catch up with the reality of family life she said fathers want to spend more time caring for their children but our outdated leave system holds them back addressing unequal caring roles will help tackle one of the most significant causes of the gender pay gap a government spokesman said shared parental leave gives working families more choice and flexibility helping to close the gender pay gap and enable fathers to play a more active role in caring for their children this government is committed to working with business and other groups to promote its benefits and help change attitudes on shared parenting this is still a very new policy which the government will continue to evaluate the committees recommendations will form a part of that evaluation signatories of the letter david lammy mp

when amanda boorman adopted jazz then aged five social workers told her to avoid the town in which her childs birth parents lived the impression i had was that they were quite scary and potentially quite dangerous she said but boorman a trained social worker who founded the open nest a charity that supports adoptive families felt that she had not been told the full story she decided to visit them i wanted to know their story and how things came about in order to tell the person who was going to be my child about why they had been adopted three years later she made the decision to reintroduce jazz to them i knew the risks were disturbing jazz further there were no two ways about it the parenting wasnt good i didnt have a romanticised idea of it but i wanted to be a bridge between the past and the future a fouryearold does know things more than people give them credit for she did love her parents i felt that wed stolen her as well a lot of her disturbance i felt was due to being completely removed from the people shed been sleeping in the same room as for the first four years of her life most adopted children do not have facetoface contact with birth relatives but a major new resource underpinned by an extensive academic study and contributions from social workers and families across the country could change the approach of adoption agencies and mean more people follow in boormans footsteps the launch of the contact after adoption website a partnership between the university of east anglia and research in practice follows recent comments by senior judge lord justice mcfarlane who questioned the right of adoptive parents to veto contact elsbeth neil director of research at the ueas school of social work whose work underpins the new website says facetoface contact should be considered in more adoption cases for years or so people have had similar attitudes towards contact yes its a good idea but lets keep it very small and if it stops after a year or two so what maybe thats a good thing theres a lot of ambivalence about contact because adoption was seen as a clean break and birth families as a bad influence its hard to shift those attitudes people generally accept the need for some form of contact but what they tend to set up is formulaic its a letter once a year it may or may not involve photographs increasingly people are worried about exchanging photographs because of them circulating on social media theres a perception that sending letters is easier than facetoface meetings neil said but the opposite can be the case if you imagine what its like to write a letter once a year to someone youve possibly never met about such an intensely emotional thing we followed up these families for years and the majority of the letters didnt last for more than a year or two because i think its too difficult to write that sort of letter facetoface contact is more immediate and meaningful particularly to the children neil who followed a group of adopted children until they reached age to monitor their experience of birth family contact said arrangements needed to be based on the childs need and reviewed over time as families and their children develop her research found that contact with birth relatives did not affect a childs overall development though there were indications that it contributed to young people having a more cohesive sense of identity they were more likely to be positive about contact when it was predictable and had been kept up over the years john simmonds director of policy research and development at the corambaaf adoption and fostering academy which supports social care professionals said children need more individualised support especially given that many are adopted from the care system and have experienced abuse or neglect these are complex issues how do you deal with these questions of curiosity and need to know and right to know on one hand with the fact that what youre also dealing with is really often quite extreme circumstances where children have experienced physical abuse emotional abuse or sexual abuse how do you explain to a child that you were removed because you were abused by your parents or sexually abused by your parents hugh thornberry chief executive of adoption uk said agencies were moving away from the idea that adoption was something that had an impermeable seal around it he said that the risks of direct contact such as disrupting a placement or retraumatising a child could be carefully managed by professionals and families a more open approach to adoption can avoid another risk which is that lots of children can build up an idealised version of their birth family despite what might be said to them sometimes that can be reinforced by parents contacting them on social media in an unsolicited way but compelling adoptive parents to maintain facetoface contact a suggestion raised by justice mcfarlane is unlikely to be helpful says neil contact is only really beneficial to children when everyone who is involved is doing it willingly and with an open heart we need to do more to help adoptive parents think through the potential benefits of contact for their child as well as assessing risks and difficulties but we also need to do more to help them think through the potential difficulties if they refuse reasonable requests to promote contact for amanda boorman facetoface contact gave jazz the chance to understand the complex reasons why her birth mother wasnt able to care for her something she is unlikely to have gained from an annual newsletter before she thought she was rubbish that shed been thrown away that shed probably been naughty that stopped after she met them her selfesteem went up massively just thinking that youre the product of a bad place is not a healthy thing,2017-03,amanda boorman adopted jazz aged five social worker told avoid town child birth parent lived impression wa quite scary potentially

most women are only one man away from a welfare cheque gloria steinems famous warning may sound now like a tinny echo from history a throwback to distant days when wives rarely worked or if they did earned peanuts her call for women to recognise their own vulnerability and understand that true security comes not from marriage but from knowing you can earn a living was an essential battle cry back in the early days of the womens movement these days work is just what we do female employment is at a record high stayathome parents an increasingly exotic minority and while theres no right time to go back to work after having a baby however long or short a career break you take most of us agonise over whether we judged it wrong the assumption is that sooner or later virtually everyone gets there so why should it feel so uncomfortable when the state moves to set this emerging consensus in cold unforgiving stone for that is what is happening with surprisingly little public debate ruth deech the crossbench peer and lawyer is bringing a private members bill through parliament arguing that maintenance for divorcees be limited to three years although payments for children would continue until the end of university after that the assumption is theyll jolly well get a job and fend for themselves unless they can prove particular hardship keeping former spouses on the hook financially for a marriage that may have ended years ago is she argues hopelessly behind the times on the face of it the idea that marriage shouldnt be a lifelong meal ticket sounds fair but deech goes further arguing that current arrangements arent just hurting the one picking up the tab but also actively holding the lower earner back the assumption throughout the legal system that once a woman is married she is somehow disabled and incapable ever of managing on her own is she argues what is stopping women being treated seriously at work really it couldnt be the other way round with motherhood if not marriage rendering even the toughest of us vulnerable to not being taken seriously deechs bill may have little chance of becoming law but its worth examining because it reflects a broader debate about nonworking parents from next month changes to the benefit system will see the widowed parents allowance paid to those bereaved with young children capped it was never a fortune a taxable benefit of up to a month but it was paid until children grew up and gave traumatised families breathing space easing the pressure on the surviving parent to earn from april however it will be paid for just months and then withdrawn in what ministers euphemistically call a move to help the widowed readjust if that doesnt seem long to grieve stabilise the children reorganise home life and throw oneself back into work its more grace than some of those rendered unexpectedly single may get also from april unemployed lone parents mostly women and others on universal credit must be actively seeking work from when their youngest child is three and attending workfocused interviews once the youngest is one we have leapt within two decades from a tacit acceptance that single parents probably wouldnt work via new labours expectation that in return for help with childcare they should start jobhunting once the children were in secondary school to the apparent assumption that a years maternity leave is more than many can afford so single mothers cant be mollycoddled tough luck if you find the logistics impossible with only one person to do the nursery dropoffs which leaves deechs threeyear transition phase for divorcees looking remarkably in step with the times its true that things have moved on from the days when a woman without a man was seen as a helpless charity case and not just because the courts are increasingly dealing with cases of highearning wives expected to pay maintenance to former stayathome fathers many women will have squirmed uncomfortably on reading lurid accounts of highprofile divorce cases involving millionaires wives seeking to be kept in the style to which they have grown accustomed who are these women indignantly demanding fur coat allowances that outstrip what most of us earn in a year turning their noses up at the wrong sort of houses in belgravia pleading helplessness at the very idea of a job have they never heard of sisters doing it for themselves but these are the glitzy exceptions to a more painful workaday rule with divorce courts increasingly assuming that by the time children are seven or so a stayathome parent should be working women my age lecture our daughters never to rely on a man for money whatever choices these girls make they cant say they werent warned but as the supreme court judge lord wilson argued a yearold wife who may not have worked for nearly four decades and never expected to have to do so again may not be able to waltz into a job if her husband leaves her sometimes the deals done inside a marriage the tangled expectations of an entirely different era cant be unravelled easily as for the welfare state the days when it could afford to stand in for every missing spouse are gone public willingness to support other peoples children and it is the children the state is really protecting via their mothers is shrinking even faster than the tax base but until every single parents chance of getting hired or promoted is equal to a childless persons and a womans working opportunities are genuinely the same as a mans it seems pragmatic to err on the side of caution and flexibility

this week federal parliament debated a childcare funding bill they were obliged to do something on sunday australians learned that with million children in childcare australias childcare costs have risen at five times the rate of inflation over the course of a year families have a tendency of taking out their financial tension at the ballot box so malcolm turnbull and the liberalnational coalition have acted in their predictable way exploiting that which is politically necessary to achieve what is abominable the coalition originally attached a childcare funding increase to an omnibus savings bill that recycled the broadbased punitive cuts of abbotts infamous budget this week they compromised to merely freeze the family tax benefit leaving cuts to paid parental leave the abolition of the energy supplement for new recipients cuts to pensions of migrants and the proposed fourweek wait for unemployment benefits on hold on thursday night something like a government childcare bill passed the senate with the support of the nick xenophon team one nation derryn hinch and david leyonhjelm for those unable to process what the actual changes mean youre not alone childcare policy has become so labyrinthine and the compromises are so confusing its hard not to believe its deliberate advocates such as eva cox have been decrying the too complex overly bureaucratic nature of coalition childcare policy as counterproductive for years early learning campaigners such as lisa bryant are concerned proposed new activity tests demanding parents must prove participation in work or study to receive assistance will reduce hours of subsidised care and create uncertainty for parents in unstable casual jobs or complex circumstances new billing systems encourage providers to further casualise the already underpaid childcare workforce how underpaid early childhood educators are paid less than dog groomers and up to a third less than someone who teaches primary students instead its a heady time to be a corporate childcare provider if not a worker family or you know child whats getting lost is the question of whether the current infrastructure of childcare what should be early learning in australia even meets family needs let alone educational best practice or longterm social good outcomes the answer is no on all fronts there are some standalone centres that really care says red ruby scarlet an early childhood teacherresearcher who also advocates for the campaign group social justice in early childhood but policy has shifted and changed nipped and tucked and made it harder and harder for centres and providers to present themselves as places of early learning rather than cheaper lessexpert facilitators of childcare market forces took over says scarlet of the shift when education was privatised it became about fees and accessibility it wasnt always this way deborah brennans excellent history the politics of australian childcare tells the story of an idealistic th century movement for child education and social opportunity whose transformative achievements over decades conveniently dovetailed with a s labour shortage that heralded the entry of more women into the workforce in the liberalcountry party government introduced the child care act to fund community childcare nonprofits then gough whitlam was elected and an entire year of free preschool education was promised to every child and an agenda of early learning for the social good dominated australias golden age of early childhood education that the subsequent fraser government did not dismantle little vanessa badham three years old in and living in the canberra suburb of chifley her dad working at the new dog track her mum trying and failing to avoid ingratiation into the local suburban

months old their brains are at their peak of being receptive to languageshe wrote interaction with a loving caregiver or caregivers is the very basic building block of the brains these baby humans will use throughout their lives this is mainstream opinion writing in the guardian oxford professor edward melhuish was overt in his pleas for australian early learning to be free and universal the governments bills are both symptoms and traditions of the neoliberal attitude to early learning first embraced alas in the hawkekeating era with a recession driving women back into the workforce in labor adopted a softvoucher system of individualised family funding to encourage childcare private enterprise to meet an expanding demand for centres and services the then government didnt believe it could afford its the foundational framework for what we have now a childcare situation that victoria universitys mitchell institute compared this week with the disastrous vet policy that has funded private colleges at the expense of the quality and accessibility of tafe with public subsidies flowing to private providers rising fees and underresourced regulatory bodies the researchers wrote in the mandarin we are in danger of repeating the same mistakes the question has to be asked just what is australia receiving for the coalitions direction of more money to the same problem underpaid early childhood educators are still locked in cycles of bruising industrial battles children are still on the receiving end of denuded and unequal services a nick xenophon team amendment retained some targeted funding for indigenous remote and disadvantaged communities but a laborgreens amendment to increase hours of subsidised care to hours for lowincome families was lost women are still still obliged to engage a juggle struggle around structural sexism inflexible work and the unpredictable realities of parenthood and the potential of broadbased education outcomes are still not the priority of a policy thats more about workplace participation and productivity than longterm social good why do parents have to be working for their children to be offered a bestpractice education lets not be mistaken that this is some kind of gift to families so much as its a governmentfunded market guarantee to private profit and a pale bribe to women who work the state remains obliged of course to pick

men should be given fatheronly parental leave to tackle the very very low takeup rate experts have told mps dads who want to be more involved in their childrens lives fear damaging their careers and denting their familys income if they ask for flexible hours or parental leave a hearing on working fathers heard experts told parliaments women and equalities committee inquiry that men should have the right to a period of paid leave allocated only to them to tackle a woefully low takeup rate which resulted in just one in men requesting parental leave in the months after the flagship policy was introduced in april we have to really try to enable and i think make fathers take up leave said tina miller professor of sociology at oxford brookes university clarifying that she believed there should be a nontransferable element to parental leave she added if we are serious about men being involved its the only way mothers and fathers dont take decisions about who takes leave from a level playing field its gendered its historically unequal the government has estimated that only of eligible working fathers would take leave in the current system this compares with about nine in fathers in sweden and norway where of their earnings are replaced while they are on leave duncan fisher cofounder of the family initiative told the hearing the current parental leave system was terrible it absolutely emphasises the idea that the caring role is the mothers he said the leave is given to the mother and she gives to the guy if she wants that communicates a really unfortunate message which is a foundation of gender inequality in our society that caring is a womens role he called for women and men to be given separate but equal paid leave entitlement and said the government needed to push a public awareness campaign you have to put it out there get behind it and believe in it he said fathers who were as involved in childcare as their partners often faced disparaging remarks and discrimination in the workplace the inquiry heard you still hear comments if a father is leaving to pick up a child that he is escaping early again that you would never dream of saying to a woman said edward davies from the centre for social justice while mothers have had to fight for equal opportunities in the workplace for years no one has fought for fathers in quite the same way he added this chimed with the experience of several guardian readers oli a former state schoolteacher explained that he wanted to take shared parental leave so his selfemployed wife could go back to work while my employer said that i could take the leave they would not pay me the statutory maternity pay saying i would have to go unpaid so i went back to work once my paternity leave came to an end he said david a marketing manager for an engineering company said although my request for flexible working was granted i often feel as though management are trying to catch me out and flippant remarks about my being a parttimer are commonplace he added i wouldnt change my time alone with the kids for anything but i do feel it has damaged my longterm prospects at my current job and eventually i think i will need to move on in order to progress mothers have faced the same problem for years now another father based in edinburgh but working for an american company found himself facing a disciplinary hearing for unacceptable absence after having to take time off to look after his son who had caught chickenpox despite offering to work early mornings evenings and weekends hr dismissed the case but i was told to ensure my son didnt catch chicken pox again incredible sarah jackson chief executive of working families said men should have paternity rights from their first day on the job saying currently they faced huge inequality right from the start most flexible working cases never make it to an employment tribunal she added because the compensation was set at a maximum of eight weeks pay a figure that was not worth most employees losing their job for employers look at a woman and they are frightened they look at a man and they are not she said the inquiry comes after the modern families index found that more than half of millennial fathers want to be demoted into a less stressful job in order to be a better parent it also warned of a fatherhood penalty for men who want to be more involved in the upbringing of their children with admitting to lying to their employer about familyrelated responsibilities that get in the way of work maria miller the conservative mp who chairs the committee said there were significant questions about whether culture at work has changed enough to enable the shared leave policy to be effective we need to find out what we can learn from other countries she said,2017-03,men given fatheronly parental leave tackle low takeup rate expert told mp dad want involved childrens life fear damaging career denting family income ask flexible hour parental leave

when times are tough those without a voice are destined to lose out with no vote no power and no say children are easy to ignore when it comes to divvying up dwindling resources councils have already said they may not be able to meet basic obligations to schools such as checking staff for criminal records and making buildings asbestosfree but thats just the tip of the iceberg as a former childrens minister ive seen firsthand that childrens social care is hugely challenging social workers step in where other services cant they work with children who have been let down by other adults and with families in crisis recently though its become clear that local authorities are increasingly unable to meet demand for services growing awareness of the scale of child sexual abuse and exploitation has led to more children coming to the attention of professionals which of course is a good thing it has also had a significant impact on resources overall the number of children on a child protection plan rose by almost between and for context local authority costs for childrens services rose by just in the same period and overall local authority expenditure dropped by more than i have just chaired a crossparty inquiry into childrens social care supported by the national childrens bureau we repeatedly heard evidence that in order to fund services for those children most at risk other types of support are being cut in the current economic climate it comes down to a zerosum game protecting children in immediate danger has to take precedence leaving little left for early intervention or preventive services strikingly in a survey conducted for the inquiry of directors of childrens social services reported finding it increasingly challenging to fulfil their statutory duties towards children who need help to achieve or maintain a reasonable level of health and development this includes children who are disabled those whose parents are in crisis and children who may be at risk of harm but of course failure to act early has consequences problems can escalate meaning children will need more significant and costly help later on there are signs that this is happening already between and the number of children taken into care rose by almost and is now at its highest since back in the munro review of child protection which i commissioned while minister for children and families recommended that the government introduce a new duty on local authorities and others to provide earlyhelp services for children young people and families today this seems even more important significantly though national government must also provide protected funding so that alongside tackling abuse we can also intervene early to help families stay together and give children the best possible chance of a positive future alongside resource constraints our inquiry also identified another significant area of concern in childrens social care we found that there is huge variation in the way in which local authorities decide to support the most vulnerable children perhaps most strikingly the proportion of children in care varies from just per in one local authority to per in another this cannot simply be explained by differences in deprivation it points instead to variation in policy and practice given we know that children in care are far less likely to gain good gcses and to go to university and more likely to have poor physical and mental health such a postcode lottery is deeply worrying its clear to me that the governments priority should be to improve standards of care for all vulnerable children in our society for this reason i strongly opposed plans to allow local authorities to opt out of statutory duties towards children and families for up to six years this would have risked entrenching and legitimising the fact that children in one borough arent getting the same quality of care as children in the neighbouring borough i applaud ministers brave decision this week to drop these misguided and potentially dangerous proposals weve stepped back from a cliff edge that threatened the whole fabric of childrens social care legislation this doesnt mean however that nothing needs to change we know that the system is failing far too many children innovation is essential for driving improvement and we should continue to support local authorities in finding better ways to meet the needs of their population crucially we should put effort and resources into spreading good practice so that children across the country can benefit what we should never do is endanger the sanctity of universal legal entitlements children and families must know that their rights under the law are the same no matter where they live equally every local authority must be held to account in meeting a fundamental set of duties the government has made the right choice the next question is where we go from here i urge ministers to focus on two key themes first realistic resourcing of all childrens services from prevention to early help for families to care and child protection and second tackling the stark variation in standards across the country,2017-03,time tough without voice destined lose vote power say child easy ignore come divvying dwindling resource council already said may able meet basic obligation school checking staff

childrens social services are being engulfed by a funding crisis in which nine out of local authorities are struggling to meet their legal duties and families face a postcode lottery a damning report has concluded the inquiry by mps led by a former conservative childrens minister tim loughton has found wildly different approaches in the ways that councils intervene and how likely they are to take children into care the report shared exclusively with the guardian found that in one part of the country blackpool more than seven times as many children were being taken into care than in another richmond in london it also cited a tenfold difference in the numbers being referred to services in the first place from per children in one area to a massive in another the report by the allparty parliamentary group for children also suggested that councils were coping with a spending squeeze by tightening up the criteria by which they classify a child as being in need cutting thousands out of the system altogether one council told mps that the numbers of children in need was being grossly underreported because of the reality of rapidly rising thresholds that arise from reducing resource loughton said the inquiry had revealed that childrens services were stretched to the limit and in many cases on the brink and called on the government to urgently investigate the extraordinary differentials any vulnerable child deserves the same protections and interventions wherever he or she lives in the country but clearly from such a huge divergence in outcomes this is not happening he said anna feuchtwang the chief executive of the national childrens bureau which supported the inquiry suggested that the result could be children unnecessarily separated from their families if the government doesnt adequately fund childrens social care more children and families will be left to fend for themselves as their problems escalate to crisis point a system that only steps in once a child is in dire need is both costly and cruel it means for example that children could end up in care or experience abuse when providing support earlier could have kept them with their family she said the report found that differences in demography or resource did not come close to explaining the massive variations instead it concluded crucially local policy decisions are leading directly to stark contrasts in childrens outcomes including the likelihood that they are taken into care one worrying finding was that early intervention was being cut meaning families were ending up in crises before receiving help moreover councils faced a recruitment nightmare with one revealing a vacancy rate forcing heavy reliance on temporary agency staff the situation has become so acute that a survey carried out by the mps found that overall of directors of childrens services were finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil their statutory duties towards vulnerable children loughton warned that the area had become a cinderella service because vulnerable children were not seen as everybodys business while the idea of growing old and needing adult social care was asked if he feared a repeat of the death of monthold peter connelly initially known as baby p loughton argued that cases were happening all the time but not being reported when i was childrens minister every monday we went through a list of children who had been attacked or killed and there were terrible cases that didnt make the headlines it was two kids a week being killed at the hands of carers he said he said that was being spent on preventative help compared with spent on reactive services arguing the opposite should be true the local government association responded by warning that councils faced a bn funding gap for childrens services by and said that time was running out to find savings without a lasting impact on critical services councils have been warning government for some time that the pressures facing childrens services are rapidly becoming unsustainable with a combination of government funding cuts and huge increases in demand leaving many areas struggling to cope said cllr richard watts chair of the lgas children and young people board whatever the pressures he said it was important to recognise that social workers continued to provide heroic levels of support taking tough decisions to save childrens lives labours shadow childrens minister emma lewellbuck herself a former social worker said this report is alarming but sadly not surprising given how hard the council cuts have hit childrens social care instead of learning the lessons addressing those failures and protecting services from cuts the department has focused on a few shortterm projects in a few local authorities through the socalled innovation fund so it is no surprise that this piecemeal approach has led to an even more fragmented and inconsistent service for our most vulnerable children and families a department for education spokesperson said we want every single child no matter where they live to receive the same high quality care and support and this is exactly what our reforms are set up to deliver we are clear that providing help as early as possible is the most effective way of keeping children safe and our new what works centre for childrens social care will ensure social workers across the country are able to learn from best practice the dfe argued that the department had taken tough action where councils were failing children and was supporting the recruitment and training

tabitha morton readily admits she was an armchair activist before the womens equality party wep launched in the yearold from a workingclass labourvoting family in liverpool had increasingly struggled to find a party that she felt spoke for her interests we had a conservative government an opposition that just wasnt credible and no matter what party i looked at equality for women just wasnt on the agenda she says it just didnt feel like anyone was talking to me or my friends about the things we cared about two years on and morton who is head of integration at the security company yale uk is the weps candidate for the liverpool city region mayoral race the party which now has members and supporters hopes her presence will bring some muchneeded attention to gender equality in the northern powerhouse in may mayors will be elected to represent the liverpool city region greater manchester the tees valley the west midlands the west of england and cambridgeshire and peterborough taking roles that were created in return for devolved powers mortons candidacy was announced in the same week as the annual northern powerhouse conference in manchester which was criticised because all of its main advertised speakers were men across the northern powerhouse region there are amazing women who work in business the nhs and all walks of life and theyve just been ignored says morton women donned hard hats hivis jackets and mens suits for a lass war protest on the opening of the twoday summit where only out of the speakers were women the response from the organisers was that it was hard to get women along says morton we dont accept that research by the fawcett society last year found that while of councillors in the northern powerhouse are female women make up just of senior leadership roles the devolution deal for the liverpool city region which sees powers over transport planning and further education transferred to a newly created combined authority was agreed by the heads of the six local authorities in the area all of whom are men the deal was done by men for men and we need to raise womens voices says morton we need to challenge that deal and go back and renegotiate it so we can get a better deal for the region up until now of the population has been ignored she says the liverpool region has the highest reported level of domestic violence in the uk and there is no strategy to tackle that by putting it on the agenda were showing the other parties that it counts we want the other parties to get on board with this we want them to adopt these policies id be very happy if some of the other candidates stole some of our ideas and claimed them as their own asked how she will appeal to male voters morton responds that equality is good for everyone most men would find it hard to disagree with her policies of integrated health and social care tackling domestic violence and street harassment and using skills and training to reduce inequality she argues we do have to look at these issues such as transport and education through a gender perspective because it is so often women who lose out,2017-03,tabitha morton readily admits wa

in the aftermath of surviving the worst forms of domestic violence i packed up my life my daughter and my courage in to start work as a community family violence educator in the northern territorys barkly region the countrys largest local government area and a hot spot for some of the highest rates of violence and child abuse in australia my work and home base was at tennant creek and it was there that i found a model to restore the agency and status of aboriginal women an agency that has been so diminished for so long the tennant creek womens refuge is an eightbed shortterm crisis accommodation service with a fulltime counsellor and a small team of gutsy experienced and bighearted women working as support staff in an ideal situation the tennant creek womens refuge could provide accommodation and support for women and children experiencing escaping or surviving family violence for up to three months but the services were often in such high demand that stays of two weeks in the setting were considered long stays while stays of a couple of days were the usual this is often the case for domestic violence services across the country tennant creek also has little available in terms of public housing with little new stock being built to alleviate the priority waiting list of seven years this means many women and children end up immediately living with extended family in already overcrowded substandard and unsafe housing if for some reason this kind of accommodation is also not an option a good many of these women and kids will live in ditches by the service station or in parks or at the dam or in small scrub camps outside of town family violence in the barkly region is everywhere child abuse is everywhere violence in general is everywhere it flourishes under conditions where the tolerance to violence has become so high the communities of the barkly region are often barely functional the problem is real and the lives of women children and men are being lost at a staggering rate i saw babies that had been sexually abused i saw women who had sustained head injuries inflicted by knives and machetes i constantly saw women with multiple broken limbs severe head trauma knife wounds bottle stabbings and slashings severe burns chokehold injuries severe haematoma hair ripped from their heads i knew women who were killed i also saw women who had all their money taken from them their medication was taken from them too because of this many women carried their and their childrens belonging with them at all times so as to prevent these things going missing at home i saw the sexual assault of women and children of all ages including very senior women when women were routinely admitted to the local hospital following serious assaults often with severe head injuries they would usually be given a cursory checkover if required a bandage would be applied and then the women were bustled away by police in the back of a police wagon like criminals to be unceremoniously dumped on the doorstep of the womens refuge at this point their only belongings were the strips of panadol given to them at the hospital for pain management aboriginal women and children escaping family violence are not criminals and we should not be treated as such treating us like criminals dehumanises us this attitude is wrong it perpetuates the structures and systems that continue to damage us for a very long time the barkly communities led by the womens refuge have been screaming out for a strong response to child abuse child sexual assault and neglect the resources the communities have now are inadequate they dont match the scale of the task at hand what is urgently needed is highly specialised trauma services for children who are caught in the belly of the violence a transitional school is also urgently needed in tennant creek for kids who have never attended classes or kids who are not well adjusted to a school environment it also needs a diversionary boarding school and youth programs i have been recently told the most critical need of all however is an affordable and appropriate longterm safehousing complex for women and children suffering escaping or surviving past family violence its needed now and its long overdue this is the investment that governments need to make in the future of aboriginal women and children in the barkly region a place where the aboriginal women of tennant creek can heal and restore their agency and their status a safer place for the children a hub for the many services required to support aboriginal women and children through coordinated approaches and towards a safer future what we do not need is more men telling us that we have to wait to have our status and agency restored while their election cycle

news that the uk ranks highly among the most expensive countries in the developed world for childcare will come as little surprise to those families spending an average of a year on a single parttime nursery space in london the situation is even more bleak with the family and childcare trust putting the cost of a parttime nursery place at more than the institute of economic affairs meanwhile says many families spend a third of their net income on childcare ellen broome from the family and childcare trust says it is a disgrace that so many parents are effectively shut out of the workplace by crippling childcare costs however it seems there could be some light at the end of the tunnel for cashstrapped families with the launch of a number of new schemes by the government this year but will they work for parents here we look at the options that will be available taxfree childcare as confirmed in last weeks budget the government is rolling out the taxfree childcare scheme from next month it will run in addition to and eventually replace the current childcare voucher scheme the state will contribute p for every p that parents spend on childcare with a maximum contribution of a year per child parents who work more than hours a week and who earn more than a week but less than a year are eligible they can have a combined income in excess of parents apply by opening an online account which they pay into and which will then be topped up by the government to cover the cost of childcare with a registered provider childcare vouchers under the existing childcare voucher scheme offered by many workplaces parents can pay for childcare via salary sacrifice giving of salary pretax gives parents of care vouchers saving them money as they dont have to pay tax or national insurance on the amount put aside basic rate taxpayers can claim a year per parent and higher rate ones participants will now need to choose between this scheme and the new taxfree childcare system you can sign up for the existing scheme until april and make payments as long as your employer continues to offer it so which is best this depends how much a parent earns how much is spent on qualifying childcare and how old the children are according to jonathan wattslay from wealth at work the new scheme will only be available to parents with children up to the age of whereas the old system is available up to age there will be no national insurance savings under the new system therefore employed parents with lower childcare costs could be worse off also both parents must be working says wattslay generally taxfree childcare makes sense if a parent has two or more children as it offers savings per child per year childcare vouchers are likely to be best if one or more parent earns more than or if one or more parent doesnt work at all free hours children aged three and four and some aged two are entitled to hours of free early education a week and from september this will double to hours a week the hours must be spread over at least three days a week for at least weeks a year but while the hours will double not everyone will get the extended entitlement to qualify parents must work at least hours a week and earn less than a year parents will be able to access funding through childminders preschools and outofschool providers however many nurseries may choose not to offer the hours because the rate at which they are reimbursed by their local authority often does not cover the actual cost of the care they provide the free hours will be very difficult for parents to actually access and the taxfree childcare scheme only addresses a fraction of the cost of childcare says rachel carrell from london nannyshare website korukidscouk the nannyshare about a third of the cost of a nanny can be saved by signing up to a nannyshare with a friend or local family in london the typical cost for a nanny share is a month per family that is based on employing a wellqualified nanny to work hours a day five days a week including all taxes and national insurance though not the potential requirement to pay into their pension outside london costs could be lower starting from around a month per family but equally they could be more because of demand while many nurseries would be cheaper than this the costsaving starts to make sense if you have more than one child a nanny charges by the hour and the cost does not go up or only rises a little for additional children the au pair potenially more affordable than other childcare options parents need to provide an au pair with free food lodging and a minimum of a week pocket money for this they can expect hours a week in help and up to two evenings of babysitting according to the british au pair agencies association while an au pair may sound appealing and cheap they may have some childcare experience and qualifications but they are not a nanny instead they come to the uk to experience a new culture and to learn a foreign language shared parental leave couples can now split the first year off with their baby mothers can take up to weeks in total but can share up to of these weeks with their partner the first two weeks following birth are mandatory both partners are paid by their own employers when they receive shared parental leave pay currently a week or of your average weekly earnings whichever is lower for weeks a selfemployed parent will not be eligible but if they satisfy an earnings test their employed partner may be able to access shared parental leave and pay if both are selfemployed neither is entitled talk to your employer a spokesman for consumer group which says parents can ask for parttime or flexible hours and their employer has a duty to consider although no obligation to fulfil the request compressed hours flexitime and jobsharing are among the options but none are an employees right the right to request flexible working was extended to all employees in april and is designed to give employers confidence in responding positively to requests and changing workplaces cultures for the better says stewart gee from employment relations specialist acas claim help parents should ensure they are claiming all the benefits to which they are entitled child benefit of for the eldest child and for subsequent children is available to parents of those under providing neither has an income

be the answer for parents jacqueline milward and her husband simon save a year by having a nannyshare for their children oscar and annabelle months when we only had oscar to think about we paid for him to go to nursery locally says jacqueline who works as a manager in a sustainability thinktank the family live in ladywell in southeast london with the free hour allowance this cost us about a week for a fulltime place from ampm for five days a week we then paid an additional a day for a childminder to pick him up from nursery and care for him until pm when annabelle arrived however costs started to mount we found ourselves paying an additional a week for a childminder to look after annabelle for hours a day four days a week jacqueline says the couple found a local family interested in nannyshare via website korukids and the toddler is now looked after for hours a day four days a week oscar is in reception class but our nanny also looks after him after school along with two other children from another family who live across the road this costs us around a week the cost of having a childminder caring for annabelle in addition to getting her to pick up oscar from school during

sociologists economists and many others have analysed exhaustively why women dont get certain types of job or progress beyond certain levels and why gender pay gaps exist that the competence gap between women and men is increasing in almost every developed country gives added salience to the question how and why is womens competence not recognised and rewarded as mens is that competence gap is increasing faster than the gap between men and womens pay is closing there is a striking mirrorimage symmetry here with the famous or once famous peter principle that every employee rises to his sic level of incompetence the opposite is the paula principle most women work below their level of competence this principle reveals two things that should concern us all a persistent unfairness or injustice in the way education is rewarded and a waste of proven talent by rewards i dont mean only financial returns but also satisfaction from knowing that ones abilities are being properly employed and a sense of progression of moving forward as a man writing primarily about what is and isnt happening to women at work at times i struggle to find an appropriate voice obviously i cant speak with the kind of subjective experience that may give a richer tone but my intention is to include everyone in the conversation indeed my main conclusion concerns men as much as women it is that women will only get to use their competences fully when both are able to pursue mosaic careers which do not conform to the conventional model of fulltime continuous employment we all need to see equality in a more dynamic way that does not focus only on individual times in womens working lives but across their whole life course concentrating on symmetry between women and men at any single stage in life is not the best way to frame the issue for young women with a good educational record the paula principle may no longer seem to apply the pay gap for them is likely to be minimal and most options are open to them but will this parity last as they get older almost certainly not on current form womens career paths are flatter and more broken their salaries lower and their retirement incomes smaller in the debate on gender equality at work there is also a natural tendency to focus on the top jobs on how few women are judges ceos cabinet ministers and so on concentrating on the glass ceiling is understandable and justifiable in that inequality at this level reflects the structure of power most acutely people in top jobs are the ones who wield most influence and so we should be most interested in how they are distributed between women and men as well as across other social categories but this excludes the great majority of women for whom the glass ceiling is not an image that ever resonates the paula principle applies as much to the clerk who does not apply for a supervisors job because she does not have the confidence as it does to the deputy ceo blocked from the top job by covert discrimination or male cliquery it is a systemwide or rather systemdeep principle not the top layers only that we need to focus on if we want to see real change the paula principle how and

too many children are being forcibly adopted against the wishes of their families and prevented from having any contact with their natural parents a senior judge has suggested in the era of social media and with children being removed from problem homes at ever older ages lord justice mcfarlane argued it may no longer be practicable or beneficial to create an impermeable seal around an adoptive home his comments although posed in the form of questions are a challenge to current family justice policies and the dominant presumption particularly since the baby p scandal that more children should be taken out of homes where they may be exposed to violence entitled holding the risk the balance between child protection and the right to family life mcfarlanes lecture on thursday to the family justice council warned that more research was needed to justify the courts highly intrusive draconian orders for permanent removal social work practice spurred on by initiatives from the tony blair and coalition governments has led to the age at which children may be considered as candidates for adoption regularly encompassing youngsters of the ages of five six seven years or older the judge explained around of adoptions involve children over the age of four the older children are removed he said the more likely they are to carry the mental scars of their traumatic family life the difficulties facing adopters and adopted children in this regard have been made significantly more difficult with the everincreasing facility to trace and make contact in an uncontrolled way with individuals over the internet or via social media he added this has led to erosion in the hitherto impermeable seal around the adoptive placement created by social media these changes are mcfarlane said sufficient to raise the question of whether our model of adoption continues to be as valuable to each of the individuals concerned as we have hitherto held that it is britains relatively high forcible adoption rate is the judge noted rare across the world he continued magistrates and judges up and down the country on every day of the week are making these highly intrusive draconian orders removing children permanently from their natural families on the basis that to do so is better for the child and that nothing else will do but i ask rhetorically how do we know this is so family judges receive almost no feedback about the success of placements he said the stability and security provided by adoption is said to provide a quality of care which far outstrips any other model that might be available but a future which may include placement breakdown unstructured and possibly unknown contact with the natural family upset and confusion seems a long cry from the sunny upland of a happy settled secure future with a forever family which has been the traditional goal of those making adoption orders to date other problems confronting magistrates and judges in the family courts include care funding restrictions in a neglect case he said where permanent removal is a borderline decision the question of what resources can be introduced into the home to support the parents may be determinative of the outcome greater efforts should have been made to promote family drugs and alcohol courts which offer a way of breaking the cycle of vulnerability addiction confrontation with authority and failure which is so often the hallmark of families who come back and back before the family courts because without intervention they are placing their children at risk the practice of allowing contacts in abusive relationships during private law proceedings where they have been stopped in child protection proceedings should also be reviewed mcfarlane suggested better transparency in the family courts would help the public understand the nature of the dilemmas faced by magistrates and judges he said the vacuum created by the lack of sound and accurate information about the system provides a space into which illinformed and at times deliberately incorrect commentary and advice can be introduced sometimes he said such ignorance even encourages some parents to disengage entirely from the process refuse to be assessed by independent experts dispense with the expert lawyers freely provided by the state and in some extreme cases flee with their children to ireland france or further afield mcfarlane who sat for many years in the family division of the high court is on the court of appeal his lecture was in memory of bridget lindley of the family rights group who died last year,2017-03,many child forcibly adopted wish family prevented contact natural parent senior judge ha suggested era social medium child removed problem home ever older age lord justice

the course of the current parliament this is on top of the proceeds of the tampon tax which will provide m this year to a range of womens charities the chancellor philip hammond also repeated the governments commitment to introducing a domestic violence and abuse act hammonds announcement on budget day was preempted by the prime minister who had revealed the details to the mumsnet website theresa may told the parents network tackling domestic violence and abuse is a key priority for this government there are currently thousands of people across britain who suffer at the hands of abusers i know they feel isolated and do not know where to turn for help raising awareness as well as strengthening the law will prove crucial in the fight against this lifeshattering and abhorrent crime the mumsnet founder justine roberts said more funding for organisations who provide a safe haven for survivors is crucial and with two women a week on average being killed by a partner or expartner in england and wales there are many lives at stake polly neate the chief executive of womens aid welcomed the extra funding but pointed out that onethird of domestic abuse organisations run a service with no dedicated funding the services that deliver the specialist support survivors need must be protected and survivors themselves must be at the heart of all decisions made on how this fund is spent she said the chancellor also promised m to help promote returnship schemes which help people back to work after a career break by providing internships with an opportunity of a permanent role at the end they will be open to men and women but may said more often than not it is women who give up their careers to devote themselves to motherhood only to find the route back into employment closed off the doors shut to them i want to see this scheme extended to all levels of management and into industries where women are underrepresented adam marshall the director general of the british

tomorrow a patchwork quilt with squares will be displayed in westminster hall to mark international womens day each square on that quilt represents a woman who will never have the chance to celebrate the incremental but important steps towards gender equality or take part in the fight for the further change needed to make it a reality each square represents one of the women killed by a partner or expartner between and in england and wales two women a week die at the hands of perpetrators of domestic abuse and people in the uk the vast majority of whom are women are at risk of being murdered or seriously injured as a result of domestic abuse according to the charity safelives and children live in households in which highrisk domestic abuse is taking place many are directly harmed by the parent doing the abusing as well as being irreparably damaged by witnessing abuse between their parents theresa may made domestic abuse a personal priority when she was home secretary introducing a new criminal offence of coercive control back in this important reform makes it easier to prosecute people exercising the controlling or coercive behaviour over their partners that can be a form of serious emotional abuse in itself and is often a precursor to violence as prime minister she has launched a consultation on a new domestic violence and abuse act to further improve the way domestic abuse is tackled across england and wales legislative reform is necessary but it will only achieve so much without the significant cultural change needed in the police in order to ensure they use new legislation to prosecute perpetrators her majestys inspectorate of constabulary raised serious concerns that many domestic abuse victims are still being failed by the police it found many police forces are not using powers such as domestic violence protection orders to their full effect and uncovered huge variations between forces in the number of domestic violence cases not taken forward because the victim does not support police action according to hmic reductions in the police budget have left policing in england and wales in a potentially perilous state there also remains too much emphasis on tackling domestic abuse after it has happened and too little on keeping women and their children safe by preventing serious domestic violence from happening in the first place domestic abuse services have historically been underresourced and are now much more so in too many areas services remain a revolving door focused on managing immediate risks rather than taking a preventive longterm approach that supports women to rebuild their lives it remains a rarity to find domestic abuse services located in the hospitals and gp surgeries with which abused women come into contact despite the fact that almost a third of domestic abuse starts in pregnancy and that it is a leading cause of foetal death the family courts too have a greater role to play in keeping women and children safe they have been too reluctant to limit childrens contact with parents that pose a significant risk to their safety of cases going to the family courts feature domestic abuse but fewer than of child contact applications are refused and fewer than of domestic abuse perpetrators receive any specialist interventions to reduce the chances of their reoffending without this many abusers simply move on to the next victim mrs mays commitment to reform the law around domestic abuse should be welcomed but its impact is jeopardised by cuts to local government funding that have resulted in the slashing of domestic abuse services of specialist womens refuges have closed since and reductions in the police budget tragically without proper investment we can expect the quilt to get steadily

survivors of domestic abuse will find it easier to register to vote without exposing themselves to the risk of being tracked down by their attackers under government proposals announced on friday ministers plan to lower the bar people must clear in order to be allowed to register anonymously the proposals said the plans were welcomed by womens aid which said it would help survivors to participation in british democracy the proposed new measures send out a clear message to all survivors of domestic abuse that their voices matter and their participation in politics matters said polly neate the charitys chief executive domestic abuse must not deny women their right to take part in democracy so we welcome the changes proposed today on anonymous registration the proposals follow a campaign by mehala osborne a domestic abuse survivor who called for women living in safe houses to be able to exercise the right to vote i was denied a vote whilst living in a refuge and i never realised how much having a vote meant until it was taken away from me i had already been through enough and to be disempowered even more was so difficult she said i am so proud to have started the campaign that has led to these proposed changes survivors in the future will not be denied their voice and democratic right to vote dawn morville another survivor said she was unable to vote while she was living in a womens refuge for fear of her abuser finding her if he had been able to find my address there is no doubt he would have come after me this would have put not only me but the other women in the refuge at risk she said she said the proposed changes would empower survivors and give us back something that domestic abuse takes away our right to have our say and be heard without being terrified that voting could mean our abuser comes after us the current mechanism for people to register to vote anonymously requires survivors to provide court documents or get the approval of a senior police officer or director of social services campaigners have complained that the regulations do not take account of the complex nature of domestic abuse under the proposals more junior police officers and social service officials will be able to give that authorisation the list of court and other orders which are acceptable as evidence will also be updated the planned changes could be used to help victims of harassment or stalking as well as some witnesses in criminal court cases the government said they cover england and wales and ministers have said they will work with their counterparts in scotland chris skidmore the cabinet office minister who introduced the proposals said having met survivors of domestic abuse over the past six months it is clear that the existing system has often let down those affected by domestic abuse that is why today we are setting out proposals to reform the anonymous registration scheme in england and wales to make it more accessible for those escaping domestic abuse protecting the safety of survivors by making it easier for them to register to vote without their name and address appearing on the electoral register is a key part of that change,2017-03,survivor domestic abuse find easier register vote without exposing risk tracked attacker government proposal announced friday minister plan lower bar people must clear order

she is the leader of the womens equality party wep a new political force committed to furthering the cause of gender equality but which has yet to make inroads electorally he is a tory mp who tried to derail a bill to protect women against violence and told a conference hosted by an antifeminism party that feminist zealots really do want women to have their cake and eat it now in what is likely to be one of the most fascinating clashes of the general election sophie walker and philip davies are to face off on the campaign trail as other opposition parties consider giving her a free run in her attempt to unseat the shipley conservative mp the developments in the west yorkshire constituency come as attempts to engineer a broader progressive alliance gather steam on monday the leftwing pressure group compass will launch a website to help maximise the anticonservative vote in constituencies around the country and bring together activists from the three main opposition parties in a new political movement walker a journalist who became the weps inaugural leader in and has been at the forefront of its campaigns for equal representation and pay in working life said philip davies basically is a sexist misogynist who puts his own ego ahead of his constituents his antiequality agenda in westminster threatens the rights and freedoms not just of women but also people with disabilities bame black asian and minority ethnic and lgbt communities i think that shipley deserves an mp who will prioritise representing them and the issues that are important to their constituency rather than using parliament as a stage to play out attentionseeking performances davies said i have consistently asked sophie walker to quote just one thing i have ever said which has asked for a woman to be treated less favourably than a man and she hasnt been able to find even one quote from the years i have spent in parliament i would very much welcome ms walker parachuting herself into shipley as a candidate with her extreme politically correct agenda of positive discrimination and quotas and am very happy to let the good people of the shipley constituency decide who they want to represent them the green party approached the wep with the offer to stand aside according to local green activists in shipley who have yet to rubberstamp the idea but are supportive of it in theory the idea has not so far been floated widely among local liberal democrats who meet on thursday but there is strong support already among some officials however while the idea of walkers candidature has been discussed by wep and labour members of shipley feminist zealots a local group some labour members are eager to field a candidate local chairman joe wheatley said that labour had shown itself as the most effective opposition to davies who racked up a vote majority over his labour runnerup in the brexitsupporting mp will be boosted in a constituency that mirrored the referendums national result walker a remain supporter wants an equality impact assessment of any final brexit deal and the chance for mps to vote it down if necessary the constituency is not the only one where moves by opposition parties to work together are under way in the west london marginal of ealing central and acton the labour incumbent rupa huq was told on saturday by local green activists that they will give her a free run as she seeks to defend her waferthin majority of from a tory challenge echoing the view of green party leaders caroline lucas and jonathan bartley that the three main opposition parties should stand aside for each other in some seats green members have decided to support huq because she has met three conditions she broke a labour whip to vote against the triggering of article opposed heathrow airport expansion and supports voting reform huq said the local green party knows that i am a resolute remainer and that if necessary i will continue to break any and all whips to fight for the uk to stay in the eu the seats voters last year backed remaining in the eu by in these perilous times it is vital that we work together to oppose this reckless surge towards brexit she added warning that the liberal democrats would risk splitting the remain vote if they did not follow the example of the greens while the leaderships of the main opposition parties have not endorsed nationwide pacts a concerted drive to marshall antitory votes will kick off on monday with the launch of a new political movement the progressive alliance labour liberal democrat and green activists will sit in a central london war room and plan how to win dozens of tory seats where the other parties achieved combined majorities in in particular strategists are zeroing in on clusters of seats such as east sussex and brighton where tactical voting could have a significant impact rallies are also being organised in key cities where the movement believes that alliance politics can make a difference scottish national party and wep activists are also involved in the new movement which has been endorsed by lucas the green mp for brighton pavilion and the norwich south mp and possible labour leadership contender clive lewis the support of lib dem and green voters could be crucial to lewiss hopes of retaining his seat in a city where the remain vote was labour has always benefited from political alliances the last time was when an undertheradar deal with the liberal democrats not to contest key seats crushed the tories he said this is not just about stemming and reversing the blue tide by campaigning and voting smart but doing politics differently in a more collaborative way lucas said while the labour and lib dem leadership are lagging behind their own members and the general public on electoral alliances its great to see people taking things into their own hands neal lawson chair of compass said if we dont want to wake up to tory domination for decades on june we

parents in liverpool would be given free childcare for all children over nine months under radical plans by the womens equality party tabitha morton the partys candidate in the liverpool city region mayoral elections next month wants to use the m of extra money available to the new mayor each year to help parents back into work nationally the cost of childcare is thought to average around a year but under proposals that morton will lay out at blackburne house in liverpool on tuesday parents will get hours free each week after the end of parental leave at nine months paying just for every additional hour in england parents currently receive hours free only after their childs second birthday and if they are receiving benefits including tax credits and jobseekers allowance the weps plans which morton insists are fully costed would make liverpool the first city in the uk to offer universal affordable childcare for all children from the end of parental leave the party formed two years ago by sandi toksvig and catherine mayer claim the idea would create at least jobs in the liverpool region and allow more parents to work morton said this will change things so dramatically in liverpool we have got a quarter of children living in poverty and three out of four are in single parent families my proposal is that the metro mayor has m over years to spend and we need to look at this differently rather than building another bridge or road we need to actually look at how we mobilise our economy the way to do that is free childcare labour mp steve rotheram the frontrunner to win the mayoral race has suggested his priorities are affordable housing transport and skills the wep said it would fund the m plans through a combination of the liverpool city region single investment fund m a year for the next years a total of m to be used to unlock the economic potential of the region pilot project funding from central government local businesses and six local authorities party officials say the proposals would give the tens of thousands of liverpool women who currently care for their children at home but would prefer to work the chance to go into paid employment the wep insists its research suggests prioritising childcare would generate more jobs and economic benefits than traditional pledges on infrastructure and transport there is this constant battle between economic growth and social justice they seem to be a tradeoff between each other morton told the guardian we think within the first five years this will have paid for itself it makes sense on so many different levels the businesses in the area will have a bigger talent pool to pick from if we have supplied and provided quality childcare we also hope to change businesses attitudes it works in other countries in sweden you see such a different attitude to parenting and flexible working responding to analysis by the electoral reform society which suggests more than of the most powerful positions in the english mayoralties and their cabinets are likely to be held by white men morton said it is about having women on the ballot but it also about our policies the wep looks at everything through a gendered lens to make sure that there is equality because it does benefit everyone longer term morton said that she would be happy for other parties to take on her plans and encouraged the government to use the proposed scheme as a model for the rest of the uk,2017-04,parent liverpool would given free childcare child nine month radical plan womens equality party tabitha

as organisations and individuals committed to supporting children develop their speech language and communication we know from our daytoday experience the power childrens centres have to boost life chances particularly when in the most deprived areas of england two out of five children are starting school without a good level of development thats why we were delighted when in july the government announced that it would launch a consultation on the future of childrens centres twenty long months on and we are still waiting the communication trusts report talking about a generation published last week called on the government to publish a draft plan as a matter of urgency the number of centres that have closed is cause for concern according to the department for education shut in alone it is unimaginable that schools would be allowed to disappear at such a rate yet childrens centres truly are the first steps on the learning ladder communication must be placed firmly at the heart of childrens centres renewed mission developing good early language skills enables children to be schoolready promotes health and wellbeing and opens doors to future education and employment opportunities recent polling of childrens centres found that although nearly half consider speech language and communication an area of primary focus over a third report there is not enough support for it evidence on the relationship between poverty and language delay is clear as is the difference highquality early intervention can make now is the time to boldly restate the social and economic

on may it will be the th anniversary of labour women being elected to parliament this transformed not only the face of the commons but the agenda of politics and the work of government their arrival at westminster in was to be the start of a whole swath of changes to back women up in their changing lives now we live once again under a tory government which means all that progress for women is stalling and there is a threat that the clock will be turned back there are protests all around the country as childrens centres are cut back tax credits cut and support for victims of domestic violence reduced when i was elected in only of mps were women and i was one of only female labour mps womens voices were not heard in parliament and women in the country could not see their concerns reflected on the political agenda we believed that we needed to do three things transform our policy agenda so that it reflected womens concerns get more women elected as labour mps and ensure that labours frontbench team included women as well as men we knew that good as our policies for women were so long as labour remained maledominated women would be reluctant to vote for us and we would continue to languish in opposition unable to end the suffering that was being caused by margaret thatchers government we began by arguing for a woman to be on every shortlist where a labour mp was retiring although the rule change was made bringing an end to allmale shortlists men still got selected to replace male labour mps so we argued for half of those on shortlists to be women it was controversial and again failed to get women selected so we argued for half the seats where men were retiring and half the seats we hoped to win to be reserved for women this was hugely divisive and criticised as discriminatory but it went through labours conference in and paved the way for there to be labour women candidates in every region of england and in scotland and in wales who then went on to win in it was not though enough just to have women as candidates we needed women to be leading spokespeople for the party and in the shadow cabinet at that time the parliamentary labour party voted for the shadow cabinet and only one woman was elected jo richardson who was our womens spokesperson we argued for there to be a minimum of four women in the shadow cabinet and to minimise parliamentary labour party opposition extra places were to be added despite there being no fewer places for men the change was bitterly contested and called the tarts charter but at the insistence of our then leader neil kinnock the move was pushed through the plp and more women joined the shadow cabinet by we had a fully formed womanfriendly policy agenda women candidates in seats we were set to win and women in the shadow cabinet ready to take their place in the cabinet this had taken more than years to achieve but it was a massive change most of the women in the plp were new having been elected for the first time in the senior echelons of the party and the government were still male as were the top civil servants and the political advisers but as the women labour mps of gained experience they became junior ministers and then cabinet members and more women were appointed as special advisers and to the senior ranks of the civil service and as that happened our agenda for change for women gathered pace by the time we left office in government had transformed the support for women in their work and family lives we had introduced childrens centres in every community and more than doubled the number of nursery places we doubled maternity pay and leave and introduced paternity pay and leave for the first time we brought in a right to request flexible working and strengthened protection for parttime workers we increased support for carers of elderly and disabled relatives we brought in new laws on domestic violence and strengthened victim support we brought in a national minimum wage the biggest increase in womens pay since the equal pay act of we topped up the income of lowpaid women with tax credits and introduced a minimum income guarantee for pensioners and we laid the basis for further progress with the equality act today we have a female prime minister but she does not lead for progress in the lives of women in this country that role as ever falls to the labour party to our labour women mps our strong network of women councillors and party members and we will not shrink from that task harriet harman mp has written a contribution for the new

has someone asked you your salary today no how strange after all as of thursday the traditional reticence around discussing money and the secrecy over what were all paid should have ended the government requirement that all companies with more than employees publish their salary data showing the average pay for men and women has finally come into force the thinking behind this is that if companies are forced to publicly admit they dont pay their female staff as much as the males theyll be shamed into doing something about it femalefocused pay rises will ensue and praise be the uk will have solved a problem that is currently due to last until except that it wont be solved as any woman whos ever discovered that the guy sitting next to her is earning more for the same job could have told the policy wonks who thought this up why should any company worry about spending money on consultants to analyse its salaries or having to pay its female staff more when it can simply ignore the recommendations and face no reprisal the original recommendations around paygap reporting suggested companies should be fined if they failed to publish their data however the government has decided it would rather coax organisations into complying than fine them this was the approach taken to increase the number of women on ftse boards over five years of consistent chivvying the proportion moved from to in the process was declared a success and the chivvying stopped since then the number has dropped to if we want corporates to behave differently from the way they have for centuries constant monitoring and fear of reprisal is needed not polite requests the government argues that companies will start to comply once they realise that if they dont they risk not attracting the best talent this puts the emphasis on women to make sure we dont go and work for a company that treats us unfairly by making it womens job to hold organisations accountable for equal pay the government is essentially saying its our own fault if we find ourselves underpaid this attitude ignores the fact that most of us dont have the luxury of turning down a job when it comes our way the bigger problem is that these stats wont accurately reflect where the real issues lie we know there is a pay gap when looking at average salaries paid to men and women working full time however this doesnt take into account that the gap is minimal for women in their s and early s and much wider for those who are older nor does it show that women of colour earn less than white women that disabled women earn less than those who arent when it comes to pay prejudice this isnt a discussion just about gender its a reflection of how we treat anyone who isnt a nondisabled white man what gender pay reporting might do is make it clear how much more women should be asking for when theyre looking for a pay rise although again it would be more helpful if the data was intersectional however this wont help women when it comes to actually asking for more money research from harvard shows that managers both male and female respond negatively when women ask for a pay rise this negativity results in either a refusal or a lingering anger at the woman for daring to ask making it unlikely shes going to come back for more the problem with making companies publish their gender pay gap is that while it will force them to acknowledge they pay women less than men it wont force them to care to do that the government needs to start hitting companies that fail to comply with equal pay laws where it hurts in their bank

a day to celebrate a rare day when this government does something good from today larger employers covering half the nations workforce must start to publish the data on their gender pay gap for most senior managers it may come as a revelation we never knew turning a blind eye on undervaluing women is normal thats why at the current rate of change it will take until for women and men to be paid the same by which time virtually all women now at work will be retired by this time next year larger employers must publish the gender gap between average and median pay between who gets bonuses and how much and crucially the proportion of women and men within each quartile of an organisations staff there job done almost certainly not the financial times today finds companies will almost certainly not be punished if they do not comply as equalities minister justine greening says the government would prefer to work in partnership with business rather than issue sanctions but even if most do comply from everything we know about inequality after decades of neverending research we know that knowing the facts doesnt lead to action there is nothing we dont know about gender race and social immobility but policymakers pick the knowledge that suits them women are poorer this week damian green the work and pensions secretary most responsible for impoverishing them offered m in counselling to stop poor women rowing with their partners as it spoils their childrens employment prospects good idea maybe but no recompense for the bn taken mainly from womens pockets in benefit cuts beginning this week but another potentially good government act starts today and it connects to the gender pay gap the apprenticeship levy begins to take from large companies payrolls paid back to them if they spend it on apprenticeships good british employers are notorious for investing too little in training while our education system has utterly failed on technical skills but as a resolution foundation discussion this week revealed there is a long history of failed initiatives with fraudulent training providers and useless schemes that dont improve young peoples prospects reasons to worry this time start with yet another reckless tory manifesto pledge to provide three million apprenticeships by that risks another dash to badge anything remotely like training as an apprenticeship regardless of quality why is all the bn levied not to be spent on topquality upskilling the institute for fiscal studies reveals that government plans to spend just m on apprenticeships the treasury keeping the rest despite brutal cuts to further education colleges that provide most skills training in this dash for three million apprenticeships the disappointment is that nothing serious is to be done about the great gender divide in the routes young people take too many girls are doing what girls always have caring catering cashiering for crap pay the same old four cs the pay gap begins right here in womens job destinies the popular image of an apprentice is the bright young lad with spanner in hand and draftsmans pencil behind the ear headed for highstatus engineering at rolls royce or bae systems where more people apply for each gold dust place than apply for oxbridge but of apprenticeships are in the service sector reflecting most british jobs an apprenticeship at level in nursery or social care hair and beauty retail and admin is a very different animal often geared narrowly to an employers highly specific task useless for transferring with no upward ladder women do badly out of apprenticeships earning less even before they have children and hit that pay barrier the young womens trust found on average they earn just an hour compared with an hour for male apprentices leaving them a year worse off only of engineering candidates are women despite decades of exhortations to break down gender straitjackets since and michael goves mindless destruction of the careers service most school pupils just get an online service or untrained teachers who cant know about the myriad jobs people end up doing and how to get there social pressure on young women to do traditional feminine work is such an overwhelming electromagnetic force that change in traditional roles is snailpace slow talking to schools i have often asked boys and girls to write down their ambitions and the difference is staggeringly depressing among those not headed for university the bullypower of being thought unfeminine is far stronger than generally acknowledged too many girls as trapped by it as ever when barbara castle passed the equal pay act in the teeth of opposition from much of the cabinet and most trade unions the dagenham woman along with all working women thought the job was done work of equal value if not identical jobs would be paid the same but womens work is not valued in the same way because women do it the sure sign that women themselves are not of equal value if care was mainly done by men the world would be turned on its head and their pay would reflect a higherstatus occupation parity of esteem is the governments aim for the apprenticeship route but there is zero chance of that in this unequal classbound society where decisionmakers will continue in whispers to view the skills path as not for our children except for a rare highprestige engineering or cabinetmaking apprenticeship for an oddball son for girls apprenticeships threaten yet again to cement them into jobs with lesser prospects money the treasury is filching from the apprenticeship levy should go towards a strong careers service that reaches girls early showing them the dismal earnings graphs for traditional female jobs but little may change until the essential work women do in care and services is upgraded and uprespected along with the status of women themselves fast sliding back in this pussygrab era,2017-04,day celebrate rare day government doe something

benefit cuts come into force today that will push a quarter of a million children into poverty but whats terrifying is that when it comes to this government throwing away swaths of childrens futures this is only part of the picture with little fuss the conservatives have quietly been overseeing a crisis in the system designed to help the countrys most vulnerable children child social care is in essence the bedrock of state support for any child in need from children with severe disabilities to toddlers at risk of neglect and teenagers in care while the crisis in adult social care has dominated the headlines recently the funding gap in the child social care system has barely made the political radar for an insight into how bad things are getting look at the newly released findings of a yearlong inquiry into child social care in england almost of directors of childrens services say they are now finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil their legal duties to children who need support thats the basics of keeping a child safe healthy and developing as the national childrens bureau which coordinated the inquiry put it to me theyre being asked to do more with less something has to give for some kids whats giving is protection from being abused or neglected for disabled children it can be their health anna not her real name has a young severely disabled son with a lifelimiting chromosome disorder the child social care system is a lifeline some respite care from a local hospice to help her and her husband rest and take short breaks away but as council cuts have come in the familys short breaks have been stopped entirely and from this year their respite care will be reduced from eight weekends a year to only two annas sons occupational therapy and home visits have been cut too in her words its catastrophic and the family are now struggling to cope while children such as annas are being left without respite care others are losing their chance of a family life as councils reel from cuts in total spending power the social care inquiry heard that local authorities are having to target dwindling resources towards children who are already suffering rather than giving preemptive help such as a social worker spotting domestic violence that could have prevented further issues arising by the time social care services are involved in many cases it means there is no option but to remove a child from their family one child being removed from their parents that could have been avoided is one too many but this is not a handful of cases since the number of children being taken into care has increased by it is no exaggeration to say this is inhumane but in a climate in which the government tells us there is no money its also hugely costly in crass terms it is more expensive to pay to keep a teenager in care after years of neglect than to fund a social worker to support a toddler at home when their parents are first starting to struggle its why the money being spent on the average child in need has actually increased in recent years but rather than it being a sign of high funding and efficiency its a symptom of shrinking resources and desperation while central government cuts the money local councils can put into child social care the number of children who need help is surging since child protection plans where social workers believe a child is at risk of harm have risen by almost a third this gets more brazen still when you learn that the government is not only failing to help these children but is helping to cause the misery in the first place as well as factors such as an increase in childrens mental health problems and child exploitation and a growing awareness of them the inquiry found repeated evidence that the surge of children in need is the result of years of welfare cuts and growing poverty cut housing benefit and a child loses his or her bedroom remove tax credit and a child doesnt get breakfast but this gutting of support for the poorest families doesnt stop at the social security system take something as simple as local youth clubs or childrens centres between and local authority funding for these early intervention services was cut by close them down and there is nowhere for young mothers to get nutritional support for a toddler a new father to get job advice or an evicted family to be passed on to a homelessness service and thats coming at the same time as one in maintained nurseries are shut funding for youth mental health services and schools is cut and as of this week a third of sure start nurseries have closed their doors its the definition of a rigged system the government cuts public services and social security which pushes hundreds of thousands more into poverty while cutting the council budgets which in turn shrinks the social care meant to protect children who need it as each thread of the safety net is pulled one by one a generation of children is left to fall

laws forcing employers to reveal the gender pay gap in their workforce which come into force on thursday could do more to reduce the earnings gulf between men and women than four decades of equality legislation according to employment experts thousands of employers will begin to record their gender pay gap figures for the first time and will have to publish their first figures before april next year the rules which will be enforced by the equality and human rights commission require companies who employ more than people to provide data about their pay gap the proportion of male and female employees in different pay bands their gender bonus gap and a breakdown of how many women and men get a bonus the legislation will affect around companies who collectively employing more than million people the changes could have a significant impact on the uks gender pay gap said sarah henchoz employment partner at law firm allen amp overy the gender pay gap reporting provisions are likely to do more for pay parity in five years than equal pay legislation has done in years she said the government hopes that by shining an unforgiving light on pay disparities companies will be forced to take measures to eliminate gender pay gaps which it argues could add bn to annual gdp by a report from mckinsey amp company why diversity matters revealed that the best companies for gender diversity were more likely to have better financial results than their competitors additional research from the consultancy revealed that without concerted action the uks gender pay gap would not close until although administratively complex this regime is good news for equality and gender diversity which means it is good news for the bottom line said henchoz research has established a link between greater financial performance and diversity particularly within the senior leadership team but new research suggests many uk employers are unprepared for the change with fewer than half saying they have sufficient salary information a survey of employers by totaljobs revealed that were not reviewing their gender equality and equal pay policies in light of the new legislation while did not have complete salary information across roles and gender more than a third were failing to review salaries to guard against gender discrimination the research during which employees were interviewed found that men were more likely to receive a bonus and that these bonuses were likely to be larger in the past year of male respondents had received a bonus averaging compared with of women who received an average of while of men felt both genders received equal pay only of women believed they were equally paid the government says the new rules will help employers identify their weaknesses and take steps to tackle them helping women to reach their full potential isnt only the right thing to do it makes good economic sense and is good for british business said the minister for women and equalities justine greening i am proud that the uk is championing gender equality and now those employers that are leading the way will clearly stand out with these requirements but the womens equality party warned that the rules alone would not eliminate the pay gap which the government puts at and the party puts closer to with fears that figures could be easy to manipulate the party is calling for companies to be forced to break down data by age ethnicity and disability as well as gender according to a recent report by the fawcett society the overall pay gap for pakistani and

parents and children are paying the price it comes after labour mp dan jarvis said sure start centres had closed since but those figures revealed in parliamentary answers in february only related to the closure of the centres rather than centres that have lost their designated status a dfe spokesman said these figures are misleading as they fail to account for childrens centres which are still offering vital services but have been merged with other centres in the area to increase efficiency if a council decides to close a childrens centre site they must demonstrate that local children and families would not be adversely affected and local areas continue to have sufficient childrens centres to meet their needs we are determined to ensure children get the best start in life and to help

a flagship policy to encourage men to take time off with their children is in danger of failing because fathers cannot afford to take up shared parental leave campaigners are warning the policy was introduced two years ago and gives parents the right to split up to weeks of shared parental leave spl between them as well as up to weeks of statutory shared parental pay however research shows that a quarter of fathers do not know about the right while the lack of financial support means many families cannot afford to take time away from work research from working families suggests that of fathers would not take up their right to parental leave a third because they could not afford to of the of the more than fathers who responded to the survey many said they wanted to spend time bonding with their child and share care with their partner families are unlikely to make use of spl unless it makes financial sense for them to do so the government should consider equalising statutory maternity pay and shared parental pay to prevent spl being a secondclass option and encourage more fathers to use it said sarah jackson the chief executive of working families employers going beyond the minimum pay for spl would also make it a more realistic option for more families shared parental leave came into force on april it was designed to enable fathers to play a bigger role than ever before according to the government the government expected a low takeup of but research last year suggested a tiny proportion of men were opting to take s pl with only having taken it so far research from my family care and the womens business council which surveyed more than parents and businesses showed that four in companies surveyed had not had a single father take spl the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said that very low takeup meant many new fathers were continuing to miss out on spending time with their children if the government is serious about men being more involved after their child is born then they should increase statutory paternity pay and make shared parental leave more flexible she said the government needs to give all new dads a right to their own paid parental leave that is not dependent upon their partners fathers have told an inquiry by the women and equalities select committee that having to balance family finances leaves them unable to take time away from work to care for their children one respondent whose wife was working a nighttime supermarket job because she had to give up her betterpaid day job after having children said shared parental leave appeared pointless to us and probably most relationships post birth because im the breadwinner and it makes no financial sense as we struggle financially already hence the predicted takeup it sounded fantastic until you read the small print men should be allowed a longer period of fullpaid leave like women can be entitled to maria miller the chair of the women and equalities committee said the introduction of spl was very welcome she added however as the written evidence to our inquiry shows fathers are questioning whether it works for them in practice and that is a concern whether it be the financial implications of taking up spl or the attitudes and culture of employers this policy may not be having the intended effect a spokesman for the department for business energy and industrial strategy said there are many factors that affect a couples decision on how childcare should be managed and by whom and shared parental leave gives parents extra flexibility when making these important decisions this scheme is still in its infancy and we will evaluate its impact in,2017-04,flagship policy encourage men take time child danger failing father

children whose parents are at loggerheads with each other are less likely to do well at school and into adulthood ministers have claimed as they promised to pour tens of millions of pounds into relationship support damian green the work and pensions secretary said children picked up on tensions within the family and that this could reduce their emotional bandwidth in dealing with daytoday issues the move is part of a m package that will also see a new phase of the governments heavily criticised troubled families programme with a fresh emphasis on joblessness green told the guardian that failure to secure work was often at the root of multiple problems and said that specialist staff in jobcentres would be used to identify and target families under the plans he said his department had carried out new analysis that found children in workless families were almost twice as likely not to reach the expected level at all stages of their education threequarters of children from families where no one works failed to reach the expected level at gcse compared to about half of children in lowerincome working families green said support would focus on tackling alcohol and drug addiction but also on reducing conflict between parents even if they were separated or divorced a childs chances in life shouldnt be defined by the background they come from he told the guardian two

leaves them with less emotional bandwidth to deal with daytoday problems the department for work and pensions analysis published on tuesday claimed joblessness was often a key factor making people considerably more likely to experience problems with their relationships have poor mental health and be in problem debt it included figures claiming workless families were potentially affected by conflict between parents the department also said that children did better if they had a close supportive relationship with their father but said only half of children in separated families saw their nonresident parent every fortnight or more the new policy will see m going into a programme to help parents resolve conflict through independent providers there will also be plans to enhance the role of jobcentre plus to take up a more active role in the troubled families work which was first launched by david cameron in the wake of the summer riots researchers have since been critical of its

harriet thompson sits in the care home lounge alone and in silence save for the patter of rain falling outside sounds of cooing and chuckling drift into the room and she grins here they come she says easing herself up to greet a wagon containing four babies being pulled by a member of staff minutes later harriet a greatgreatgrandmother and former addiction counsellor is jiggling on her knee monthold gwen who babbles and waves a plastic triceratops in the air it warms you up to see them she says i love watching them develop the arrival of the babies attracts a dozen other residents many aided by walking frames the lounge at providence mount st vincent known as the mount is soon filled with chatter laughter and song the babies visit is just one of many occasions each week when the very old and the very young mix in this intergenerational centre in seattle where a nursery has been opened inside the retirement home a heartwarming video clip from a documentary about the mount out later this year called present perfect has garnered million views there are several hundred places in the us where childcare and senior centres share a building or campus they also exist in other countries including canada and in japan where the idea originated in the s the singapore government has announced plans for such colocation centres over the next decade now this approach is starting to be discussed in the uk thinktank united for all ages uaa is hosting a meeting in london for larger care home and childcare providers to talk about it torbay council in devon is also considering the idea stephen burke the director of uaa said theres a lot of interest in colocating theres quite a lot going on in individual care homes with visits by nurseries or school groups on an ad hoc basis some more regular than others but couldnt we take it further studies have shown the benefits of interaction between young and old which include boosting health and selfesteem an experiment filmed for welsh television last year took six underthrees to a day centre for older people on three consecutive days many benefits to both young and old were noted by psychologists including helping childrens language development and confidence burke added our society is very age segregated by breaking that down at a young age hopefully you tackle some of that ageism as well as some of the loneliness you might get in care homes there are also economic advantages according to burke such as sharing backoffice costs and improving staff recruitment and retention because the job is more interesting but there are challenges care homes and nurseries have different inspectorates and statutory requirements for example there are planning issues too burke noted existing schemes wont necessarily have free land or space inside for a nursery or care home another problem is funding care homes or nurseries relying on state funding would probably not be able to finance this kind of development you need a pioneer perhaps a company who can find some investment private funding to make it happen he said charlene boyd administrator at the mount in seattle believes the benefits outweigh these challenges the mount opened as a retirement home in and the nursery which has rooms on the ground floor and on one of the upper floors where residents live was added in boyd said we wanted it to be a place where people come to live not die its about normalcy its normal for someone to use a wheelchair or a walker and thats just part of life these kids see that every day and theyre not afraid she said residents there are around seemed happier and more alert when they were with the children are enrolled shed seen one woman with advanced alzheimers and very few communication skills speak in coherent sentences when holding a baby many of our residents are widows or widowers and can become lonely having the children close by seems to make them feel as though they are still part of a community after half an hour in the lounge the babies leave and four toddlers arrive they sing and dance to animal songs as the older residents enthusiastically moo cluck and growl theyre always entertaining says elmer wittman a second world war veteran and former policeman a threeyearold holds out her hand for him to shake hi there sweetheart says the grandfather of four adding if you cant be home this is a nice place to be the nursery children who are aged from six weeks to five years interact with the residents whose average age is five days a week activities include indoor bowling music art classes chair volleyball and storytelling cheryl hadland the managing director of hadland care group which runs nurseries and care homes in the south of england is keen on the idea of colocation and will be at the uaa meeting my day nursery children visit my care homes but none of them are that near so its not something they do every week more for things like christmas harvest festival and easter said hadland there are a lot of similarities between toddlers and people with dementia its all about being happy in the moment and reassuring them so theyre not worrying about something there and then good staff supervision would be essential according to hadland and older people and children alike would have to be monitored carefully so neither put the other at risk colocation is also being discussed by torbay council in devon lorraine george one of its childminding development workers was taken with the idea after watching the present perfect clip she has been awarded a winston churchill travelling fellowship to look at intergenerational learning and will visit the us for four weeks later this year where she will spend time at the mount and at centres in oklahoma and kansas george said its certainly something that torbay is thinking about and starting to develop we are keen to work in partnership with local care homes who may have additional space and link them to someone who has that vision in terms of setting up a nursery everybody i have spoken to whether its planning or meeting with the adult care sector has been enthusiastic its such a simple idea we have a lot of children who have very little family or who are removed from their extended family most families are time poor elderly people have plenty of time and theres such a good exchange of skills judging from the faces of the very old and very young playing together at the mount it seems its also an opportunity for a good exchange of laughter and happiness,2017-04,harriet thompson sits care home lounge alone silence

jeremy corbyn appeared to forget the cost of a key labour childcare pledge during a tense interview on bbc radio s womans hour the labour leader tried to look up the policy on an ipad and in a hard copy of the labour manifesto according to the presenter emma barnett who also said corbyn received a phone call in the studio while he struggled to remember the cost of universal provision of hours of free childcare a week for all children aged two to four asked how much the free childcare provision would cost corbyn paused and then replied er it will obviously cost a lot to do so we accept that i assume you have the figures barnett asked yes i do corbyn said the point im trying to make is were making it universal to make sure every child gets it and those who get free places will continue to get them those who have to pay wont and well collect the money through taxation mainly corporate taxation when barnett asked again for the spending figure corbyn said he would give the figure in a moment the presenter said you are logging into your ipad here youve announced a major policy and you dont know how much it will cost can i give you the exact figure in a moment corbyn said again barnett then described the labour leader flicking through the hard copy of his manifesto and said he had received a phone call can we come back to that in a moment i want to give you an accurate figure he said corbyn clarified the figures in a webchat with mumsnet an hour after his radio interview at the moment the high cost of childcare means that some parents send a huge proportion of their income on childcare and as a result are very poor he told the website today weve announced a new childcare policy which is designed to give every child the opportunity of hours free childcare per week this will cost bn a year by the end of the next parliament to ensure that all children get the opportunity of an exciting preschool environment on mumsnet the labour leader took questions on free movement and on raising income tax for high earners but some users expressed disappointment that the scheduled chat lasted only minutes so that corbyn could leave on time for another event his struggle to answer questions about the flagship policy prompted comparisons with a previous interview by diane abbott the shadow home secretary in which she had trouble with the costings of hiring more police officers alistair carmichael a liberal democrat spokesman and candidate saying it seemed corbyn had been borrowing diane abbotts calculator corbyn later apologised for not knowing the figure as he spoke at a launch of the partys race and faith manifesto in watford and defended barnetts right to ask him questions saying it was unacceptable that she received antisemitic abuse on twitter following the interview i didnt have the exact figure in front of me so i was unable to answer that question for which obviously i apologise but i dont apologise for whats in the manifesto and i will explain exactly what the cost is he said its bn that it will cost by the end of the parliament and it means that million children will get childcare free childcare hours per week between the years of two and four accounting for the difference between that figure and the bn he had quoted to mumsnet a labour spokesman clarified the figure was bn for the universal childcare policy with the additional m to reverse cuts to sure start corbyn later gave a more assured performance on the bbcs one show where he talked about his background and said he was giving it everything to win the general election and felt hope of what we can do and hope of the way we can change things in this country asked about whether he is more of a campaigner than a potential prime minister he said is there a difference i have been active in politics human rights and many things all my life he added i think if you are to lead you have to be prepared to listen as well and i enjoy that did i ever set out in life to become prime minister no i set out in life to try and change things and bring about greater justice in our society and i was elected leader of our party reelected leader of our party im honoured and proud to lead the party and im giving it everything i can to win this election he also spoke about the effect of his job on his family saying those nearest to me and those loved ones everywhere have a totally unreasonable amount of pressure put on them because intrusion in my life is not nice but i am there im an elected politician it kind of goes with the territory you might say he said but widest family children its not right and not fair and i wish some of our media would just draw some boundaries asked about his experience refereeing an under football match and whether it was easier to keep control of the children than the parliamentary labour party corbyn responded tenyearolds the presenters showed photographs of corbyn as a child and with his family growing up in shropshire of his school record which saw him gain two es at alevel he said i was a not academically successful student his mother suggested examiners may not have been able to read his writing but corbyn said it was more likely that he gave overly long answers on subjects that interested him and forgot the rest of it unlike theresa may he frowned on the idea that there are girls jobs and boys jobs at home and handed over a jar of his homemade jam to the presenters labour came under further scrutiny on tuesday night when it was forced to defend its approach to immigration after an internal document was leaked to newspapers suggesting a relatively liberal postbrexit regime including underpinning lowskilled eu migration with a new visa scheme corbyn has repeatedly made clear that cutting migration is not the central thrust of the partys policy but the conservatives seized on the leaked proposals as evidence labour would fail to control the number of people coming to britain a labour spokesman said after britain leaves the eu free movement of labour will come to an end labour will introduce fair rules and managed migration based on the needs of our economy as part of our work in exploring the options a number of discussion papers have been produced this is part of one such document it is not a statement of labour policy which is set out in our manifesto,2017-05,jeremy corbyn

theresa may has pledged to create a new aggravated offence when domestic violence is directed towards a child in order to allow perpetrators to be punished for longer she also confirmed that a conservative government would introduce a statutory definition for domestic violence and establish a special commissioner to stand up for victims we will launch a relentless drive to help survivors find justice and increase the number of successful prosecutions this hidden scandal that takes place every day in homes across britain must be tackled head on said may and we must respond to the devastating and lifelong impact that domestic abuse has on children who carry the effects into adulthood she argued that the conservatives had delivered real steps towards tackling domestic violence over seven years but wanted to go further the tory manifesto promised to support victims to leave abusive partners and to review the funding for refuges however the labour party has analysed domestic violence rates since with an increase in violence against women perpetrated by their acquaintances there has been a levelling off of violence against women by strangers and a fall in violence against men amber rudd the home secretary said the intention of the commissioner was to raise standards everywhere over how police forces deal with domestic violence were building on an established model of having a commissioner who can then oversee the existing legislation and good practice generally in our efforts to combat domestic violence she told bbc radio s today programme you can see where in some areas there is underreporting of domestic violence she said her majestys inspector of constabulary did a review and found it was very patchy in different parts of the countryso we want to have a commission which will have responsibility for having oversight over that ensuring that the efforts we put in place do deliver throughout the country rudd said the hope was the commissioner would be as effective as the equivalent role combating slavery set up by may when she was home secretary she rejected the idea that police would see it as another burdensome layer of bureaucracy she said i dont hear that at all my experience of talking to police and crime commissioners and to police officers is that they do want to address it sarah champion the shadow womens minister has campaigned against the loss of of specialist refuges for domestic violence victims in england since diana barran the chief executive of the charity safe lives welcomed the decision to appoint a domestic violence and abuse commissioner we need a practical and visible commissioner who can work with specialist services local commissioners policy makers and crucially with survivors she said the commissioner needs to have both the legitimacy and resources to drive forward change she said only one in five survivors contacted the police so any future response must go beyond the criminal justice system and ensure that survivors and their children can live safely at home and rebuild their lives,2017-05,theresa may ha pledged create new aggravated offence domestic violence directed towards child order allow

under the last labour government there were impressive reductions in child poverty which are being reversed with a marked increase in the number of children living in poverty in working households health clinicians teachers local government and voluntary sector practitioners are trying valiantly to address this against a background of the most profound budgetary challenges resulting from governmentimposed austerity some leaders working with children are wondering why we cant arrive at an agreed percentage of gdp to be spent on children in the way that it is on defence and foreign aid

policies to discourage disadvantaged families from having too many children could help address the rapidly rising number of children in outofhome care in australia an academic paediatrician has suggested the rate at which nonindigenous children have been placed in short or longterm care has more than doubled over the past years and more than tripled for indigenous children australian institute of health and welfare aihw data shows the absolutely astronomical increase was symptomatic of the need for a politically charged discussion of the issue said prof peter jones the dean of medicine at bond university on the gold coast in a perspective published in the medical journal of australia on monday jones wrote that a range of interventions needed to be trialled and implemented to reduce outofhome care numbers which he saw as indicative of a failing of society rather than an expected consequence we need to ask politically charged questions such as should we be developing policies that encourage disadvantaged families to have fewer children he wrote jones told guardian australia that capping child support benefits for up to two children could be among strategies geared at reducing the number of those in outofhome care its a tough call its out of kilter with how our system currently works but there are other countries that make these decisions in the best interest of the community he said he denied suggesting that particular groups be disincentivised from having children but said limiting financial support would send the message that if you have more children its your responsibility to provide for them jones imagined that as one response among a range intended to solve a multifaceted complicated problem and compared it to longterm multipronged initiatives to reduce tobaccorelated and road fatalities another strategy would be to redirect resources to support vulnerable children towards strengthening the family into which they are born by supporting disadvantaged firsttime mothers to pursue work or educational opportunities he said as of june the aihw reported there were nearly children in outofhome care defined as those up to years who are unable to live with their families and placed with alternate caregivers on a short or longterm basis nicole rich the executive director of family youth and childrens law at victoria legal aid said the system was overwhelmed meaning there were no available resources to dedicate to preventative measures only the crisis point cases are getting the attention that they need rich said there was significant intergenerational involvement of children in the system going on to become vulnerable young parents many were not offered support at the pregnancy stage even if a risk had been identified in lots of cases no ones put any parenting programs in place for these young vulnerable mums and dads before the birth so theres a real gap that we see and that needs to be addressed supporting atrisk families as soon as they were identified whether it be through parenting programs disability andor housing support respite care drug and alcohol counselling or family violence services produced the best outcomes for children she said a study published in the journal of paediatrics and child health found children in care have significantly poorer mental health outcomes than those who have never been in care in his perspective jones found nothing to suggest that outofhome care reduced the prevalence of mental health problems he pointed to a report by the new south wales ombudsman as evidence they were at increased risk of harm compared to those who had never been in care of reviewable child deaths between and had died while in outofhome care a statistic that jones said was of major concern the assumption that outofhome care was in many cases the safest option for vulnerable children needed to be challenged he said and that the bar for removing them from their parents was sometimes too low you do have to ask the question how do we encourage behaviours that lead to less child maltreatment and neglect i think setting low expectations and expecting a social disaster from certain parts of society becomes a selffulfilling prophecy the president of the australian medical association dr michael gannon said it was a difficult balancing act between ensuring childrens best interests and the extremely fraught decision to remove them from their family every week doctors see children in desperate social circumstances that they know is just not good for their health yet balancing that against the known health risks of removing children from their families the disastrous effect that can have on individuals and at a societal level we dont claim to have the answers and we acknowledge how complex the issues are the priority should be on supporting vulnerable people to attain safe and secure living circumstances employment and community he said then theyre less likely

its supposed to take a village to raise a child in america however it takes a really big bank account indeed childcare costs in america are so astronomical that theyve even become an issue for the wealthiest ivanka trump for example has made tax deductions for childcare one of her signature issues and on mothers day sheryl sandberg the facebook executive called for america to improve its childcare policies and better support working mothers in a post on her personal facebook page sandberg pointed out that the united states is one of the only developed countries in the world that doesnt guarantee paid family leave and the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave further child care for two children exceeds the median annual rent in all states not only is childcare more than rent it costs more than college in many cases according to a recent report from the think tank new america fulltime care in child care centers for children under the age of four is a year while the average cost of instate college tuition is this means a family earning the median household income would spend onefifth of its income on childcare if youre an individual earning minimum wage then childcare costs twothirds of your income parenting isnt just expensive it can be financially devastating and yet prolife zealots never seem to argue for more affordable childcare as a means to reduce abortion its ironic that many factions of america are passionate about protecting the rights of fetuses but are quite happy to leave them to fend for themselves as soon as theyre born americas lack of support for parents isnt just financially costly it takes a big emotional toll research shows that american parents are less happy than their childless peers this happiness gap exists in other developed countries such great britain and australia but is significantly larger in america researchers found that the negative impact of becoming a parent disappeared in countries which gave parents the tools to combine work and family indeed parents in norway sweden and finland places where the government provides greater support for working families reported greater levels of happiness than nonparents sandberg lost her husband former surveymonkey chief executive dave goldberg in her post emphasizes the particular difficulties that working single parents face an issue which she was criticized for not addressing in her book on women in the workplace lean in before i did not quite get it i did not really get how hard it is to succeed at work when you are overwhelmed at home sandberg admitted and sandberg points out that that while she is financially privileged for many single parents there is no safety net of single mothers experience food insecurity yet america is the richest country in the world sandberg doesnt just call for policy changes importantly she also calls for an attitudinal shift americas childcare policies are stuck in the s theyre designed around heterosexual family units where the men work and the women stay at home but as sandberg points out since the early s the number of single mothers in the united states has nearly doubled today almost of families with children are headed by a single parent and of those are led by a single mother our attitudes and our policies do not reflect this shift sadly it seems unlikely that attitudes and policies in america will reflect this shift anytime soon the lack of childcare support in the us is emblematic of just how much the country is geared around the individual and profit and how resistant it seems to be to supporting the greater good indeed in a recent town hall congressman rod blum asked why should a yearold man have to pay for maternity care blum is hardly the only person asking this question the why should i have to pay attitude is deeply entrenched in american society it doesnt matter whether you have children or not childcare is an issue that affects all of us a lack of a safety net for working parents helps increase income inequality and drives women out of the workforce its time that america stopped talking about family values and started to put them into practice,2017-05,supposed take village raise child america however take really big bank account indeed childcare cost america astronomical theyve even become issue wealthiest ivanka trump example ha

policy their pledge in their draft manifesto would match the lib dems labour says it would double paid paternity leave to four weeks and increase paternity pay because fathers are parents too and

more than people are estimated to have experienced family violence in victoria across costing society bn an independent report prepared for the state government says the report from auditing firm kpmg to be published on friday will show that the cost of responding to this violence was bn to the state and federal governments while the cost borne by individuals and their families was an estimated at bn lost income was estimated at m while the cost of pain suffering and premature mortality was estimated to be bn this includes costs associated with the longterm health impacts of family violence and the increased risk of mental illhealth the report found this therefore includes longterm physical impacts as well as psychological impacts and nonphysical effects these impacts may extend well beyond experiences of violence with increased feelings of fear and anxiety among victim survivors damage to personal property was estimated at m the impacts can also be more significant where victim survivors may not have adequate financial means to replace or repair damaged property thus contributing to further impacts to peoples standard of living the report found aboriginal and torres strait islander people were at higher risk of experiencing violence and were less likely to report violence the report said aboriginal and torres strait islander people were often not asked about their cultural background when accessing services including police and courts however by using data that did exist from government agencies and through consultations with stakeholders kpmg estimated family violence experienced by aboriginal and torres strait islanders cost m across between and the number of policerecorded family violence incidents relating to that group increased by compared to for the rest of the population the report found meanwhile people with disabilities have a experience domestic violence at a significantly higher rate than people without a disability and kpmg estimated that the cost of family violence in for this group was in the order of m the report was one of recommendations from victorias royal commission into family violence which handed down its findings last year the commission recommended a rigorous and consistent measurement of the cost of family violence to government the community and individuals kpmg said there were challenges to carrying out the assessment including underreporting of family violence insufficient data collected by victorian government agencies on the nature and extent of family violence and associated support services required and significant gaps in available data the firm called for improved and more standardised data collection so that more accurate assessments could be made in future available data underestimated the impact of family violence the report said the victorian premier daniel andrews said while the report was a step towards estimating the cost of family violence in the state it cant show us is the pain and suffering caused by the deaths every week of a woman killed at the hands of a current or former partner we just cant let this go on he said last week an unprecedented bn was allocated by the states treasurer tim pallas in victorias budget to address family violence more money than all of australias other jurisdictions combined the funding will be used to implement the royal commissions

families but the demand for childrens social care services has more than doubled and is stretching local authority resources the warning comes just weeks after an allparty parliamentary group appg inquiry into childrens social care led by conservative mp and former childrens minister tim loughton reported that services were on the brink of collapse with nine out of councils struggling to meet their legal duties the department for education dfe said councils had managed to increase spending levels on emergency safeguarding services over the past five years it has generally preferred to focus on apparent issues of service quality and performance in childrens social care rather than lack of investment a dfe spokesperson said we want every single child no matter where they live to receive the same highquality care and support and this is exactly what our reforms are set up to deliver we are clear that providing help as early as possible is the most effective way of keeping children safe and our new what works centres for childrens social care will ensure social workers across the country are able to learn from best practice the lga said that although most councils have managed to maintain spending on families who have hit crisis point this has been at the expense of services designed to prevent problems getting out of control in the first place such as sure start parenting courses and youth work councils also fear that rising child poverty caused by welfare cuts coupled with increases in homelessness domestic violence child sexual exploitation and mental illness is driving up demand making the current funding arrangements increasing unsustainable budgets are also being stretched by the growing numbers of severely disabled children living for longer and who require extensive support and unaccompanied children seeking asylum the bn figure is an update on the lgas bn estimate from last autumn and reflects cuts to council grants coupled with rising numbers of children needing help and revised assumptions of inflationary pressure on costs there were children assessed as in need of services or protection in compared with in this includes children in care and children subject to a child protection plan the appg report suggested councils may be limiting the numbers of children in need by raising thresholds for intervention english councils spent bn on childrens services in comprising bn on childrens social care and the remainder on education support services such as hometoschool transport and services for children with special educational needs alison michalska president of the association of directors of childrens services said the projected spending gap was unsurprising in the context of increased costs and reduced budgets and likely to increase if the impact on childrens services continued to be ignored by ministers michalska said we cannot go on as we are local authorities know that a strong local earlyintervention offer can reduce the need for more intrusive and costly interventions in the lives of children and families once problems have worsened and reached crisis point yet councils have been left with no choice but to reduce these services in order to cope with rising demand local authorities have worked hard to make savings but we are running out of options,2017-05,council warned social care service vulnerable

the proportion of british women classed as high earners has not changed in the past six years despite a drive to increase the number of women in senior roles research shows women accounted for just over of higherrate taxpayers in each of the past six financial years according to hm revenue amp customs data obtained from clyde amp co law firm in the previous tax year of the million higherrate taxpayers million were women the percentage of female high earners those in the uk declaring an income between and has remained the same while the total number of higherrate taxpayers has risen by almost million heidi watson an employment partner at clyde amp co said the stubborn refusal of the percentage of female high earners to shift upwards will disappoint those who hoped a recent focus on the gender gap would make a significant difference to the number of women in senior positions the figures bring into question the success of multiple industry and government initiatives to narrow the gender pay gap and increase the number of women in senior roles including the target for ftse companies to have women comprise of their board members by a voluntary charter launched last year aimed to get more women into senior roles in financial services while many businesses set individual targets under new regulations that came into force on april companies with or more employees must disclose gender and bonus pay gaps the expectation is that gender pay reporting will start to make an impact in the next few years said watson however there have been concerns that the new legislation lacks teeth as businesses that fail to report their gender pay figures will not face any sanctions and those that report particularly bad gender pay figures will simply be named and shamed research suggests many uk employers were unprepared for the introduction of gender pay gap reporting with only saying they had sufficient salary information across roles and gender a survey of employers by totaljobs found were not reviewing gender equality and equal pay policies in the light of the legislation while more than onethird were failing to review salaries to guard against gender discrimination the research during which employees were interviewed found men were more likely to receive a bonus and these bonuses were likely to be larger a fact that could have contributed to the stagnant number of highearning women in the past year of male respondents received a bonus averaging compared with of women who received an average of while of men felt pay was equal only of women said the same sophie walker the leader of the womens equality party said these figures not only highlight the growing gap between rich and poor where the number of higherrate taxpayers is rising while record numbers rely on handouts from food banks they also provide evidence for the continuing gender pay gap that we are so often told does not exist the pay gap does exist and at every level of business because no other political party has made it a priority to fix it we understand that the pay gap will only be eliminated by tackling an unequal education system lack of shared parenting unaffordable childcare and a shortage of flexible working a report on the gender pay gap by the women and equalities select committee suggested the creation of a national pathways into work scheme to harness the skills and

its a popular misconception that foster care workers are substitute parents performing a similar role to adopters yes they passionately and tirelessly look after children and young people but the foster care workers who take societys most vulnerable into their homes are professional carers they have considerable training and in many cases qualifications must be registered with a local authority or private fostering agency are given an allowance and special tax arrangements to help cover the costs of looking after children in their homes and are often paid fees for their work they do not have legal authority over the children and indeed their role often involves helping build the relationship between biological parents and the children the secretary of state for education has appointed sir martin narey and mark owers to conduct a national fostering stocktake to make recommendations on how to improve the fostering system for englands children and young people the review will explore among other things the status role and function of foster carers in relation to other professionals as part of the team working with a child in care the independent workers union of great britain iwgb which has been representing foster care workers throughout the uk since september last year will be calling on narey and owers to consider their employment rights or lack thereof foster care workers do work that is set out for them in a written agreement and they are highly supervised yet they have no employment rights and these rights couldnt be more needed in the past few months i have heard horror stories of foster care workers not being paid enough to cover basic essentials of unfair deregistrations and of poor treatment more generally the scandal at norfolk county council where several childrens services workers were suspended amid accusations that it had wrongly removed children being just one example but perhaps most shockingly in the past six years i have spent working with and representing lowpaid workers in precarious employment i have never come across a group more petrified of victimisation than foster care workers this fear is not borne of cowardice but rather a reflection of the state of play foster care workers are all too often victimised for speaking out unsurprisingly in a recent survey conducted by the fostering network the uks leading fostering charity only of respondents stated they were happy with the status quo of being tied to one fostering service with no statutory employment rights the good news is that this is all starting to change these workers are joining the union almost every day we are challenging their employment status in a test case in scotland weve been gaining support from mps and peers from across the political spectrum confidence is growing and fear is decreasing but narey and owers need to recommend government action on two fronts in order to build on this positive trend first they should recommend that the responsibility for training registering and deregistering foster care workers should be taken out of the hands of local authorities and placed in those of a national independent and governmentaccredited body this will standardise procedures allow foster care workers to foster for more than one local authority at a time and reduce the propensity for unfair procedures and victimisation engendered by the current setup second parliament should pass a foster care workers rights bill that extends the statutory employment rights enjoyed by workers those selfemployed people who carry out their work as part of someone elses business to foster care workers this would allow foster carers trade union representation in disciplinary hearings give them statutory protection for whistleblowing and guarantee paid holidays currently only given at the discretion of the fostering service whenever one discusses employment rights for foster care workers inevitably someone asks well surely these people should foster out of love if you give them rights and more pay wont you just get a load of people doing it for the money instead putting aside for the moment the fact that this question doesnt get asked of other people who are motivated by doing good but also make a living from their profession such as doctors or teachers if people are concerned about the fair use of money in fostering then i would suggest asking questions of those who are actually getting that money such as local authorities directors of children services some of whom earn more than per year or private fostering agencies who make millions in profits the desire for working rights and decent pay should not be questioned for those who dedicate hours a day seven days a week to looking after children and young people in the most vulnerable of situations,2017-05,popular misconception foster care worker substitute parent performing similar role adopter yes passionately tirelessly look child young people

cuts to legal aid may have stopped tenants in grenfell tower from pursuing safety concerns that could have prevented the fire the president of the law society robert bourns has suggested his comments made at the launch of a report on access to justice will revive the political debate over the provision of legal advice and representation to those who are vulnerable and least well off there have been reports that tenants of grenfell tower were unable to access legal aid to challenge safety concerns because of the cuts bourns said if that is the case then we may have a very stark example of what limiting legal aid can mean certain categories of housing claims are no longer eligible for legal aid under cuts introduced by the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act laspo tenants are faced with difficult choices bourns warned to pay for their own legal advice represent themselves or be excluded from the justice system altogether the ministry of justice has began a review of the impact of laspo which came into effect four years ago the new justice secretary david liddington has disputed whether anyone raising serious concerns over safety would have been denied legal aid the law society report access denied laspo four years on says that hundreds of thousands of people who were previously entitled to legal aid have been deprived of help and advice by the m cuts pressure on public services have increased according to the study due to growing numbers of people representing themselves in court and the removal of early advice for those pursuing complaints nearly a third of the legal aid areas in england and wales have one or no local legal aid housing advice providers the law society says advice deserts have appeared neither shropshire nor suffolk have any housing legal aid advice provider the volume of legallyaided housing cases halved between and the number of such cases is still falling among those most severely affected the law society says are migrant children who no longer have access to legal aid for nonasylum immigration issues the childrens society estimates that as many as currently in local authority careand to living in private fostering are affected bourns added removing lawyers from the process is a false economy the cuts in legal aid for family law have put people off seeking advice and support from solicitors who can explain where they stand and what their rights are behind the data are hundreds of thousands of people who can no longer obtain legal aid for matters such as family break up a range of housing

my husband and i and our young daughter went on holiday to turkey with thomas cook in september we were very clear when booking the trip that one of the criteria was a kids club our daughter is an only child and misses the company of other children on holiday our local branch was very helpful in finding us our hotel however while we were abroad the club did not operate on four separate occasions as our child was the only one attending we were told repeatedly that this was because of child protection i challenged this as it did not make sense that the safety of a child should rely on the presence of another child we asked repeatedly to see the child protection policy but a copy was never provided after we got back and following repeated emails to thomas cook i was finally provided with a copy of its policy in february nowhere does it state that a single child cannot be catered for since then i have raised concerns with thomas cook that its kids club staff seemingly do not have a copy of the child protection policy on site given that this organisation is responsible for the safety of thousands of children every year this is extremely worrying mr perth and kinross kids clubs and organised activities are now an established and important element of package holidays to the extent that parents seek them out and will actively choose breaks which include them theres usually a difference between activities that need to be booked and paid for and those that you can just turn up for on the day in your case the issue rather oddly became one around child protection but thomas cook said its own staff may have misunderstood this policy it insisted that child protection was not an issue here as your child was never at risk instead the rules around numbers as in any childcare setting involve ratios of adults to children thomas cook said that if there are fewer than two children in the kids club there have to be two adults in the room thomas cook said there were not enough staff to satisfy the twostafftoonechild ratio on the four occasions you mention so in compliance with its policy it was unable to go ahead with the activities a thomas cook spokesperson said we are sorry that mrs daughter wasnt able to enjoy some of the kids club activities while she was on holiday with us weve apologised to mr and offered some vouchers towards their next thomas cook holiday

the governments plan to provide hours free childcare has been criticised by a leading global education expert for failing to target the most disadvantaged families whose children stand to gain the most andreas schleicher education director of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd welcomed the doubling of the free childcare offer which he said would bring england up from the bottom of the international league in terms of hours offered to an average position but he questioned the governments decision to target the offer at working parents who can earn up to each and still be eligible rather than prioritising access for the most deprived families who may not qualify from september three and fouryearolds of working parents in england will be eligible for hours of governmentfunded childcare per week to qualify each parent or the sole parent in a single parent family will need to earn at least the equivalent of hours per week working at the national minimum or living wage the conservative initiative has been widely welcomed by working parents among whom it was a clear vote winner in the election but labour has warned that lowincome families in insecure employment or on zerohours contracts who may be unable to guarantee how many hours of work they will get from one month to the next will lose out in addition early years providers have warned repeatedly that they will struggle to deliver highquality care and education and sufficient places with the funding being made available schleicher who made his comments at the launch of an oecd report comparing early education in the worlds industrialised countries said he understood the importance of supporting parents to get back into the workforce but he added its not just the hours its making sure those children who need it most get the best provision neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance said his organisation had long argued that given limited resources the government should focus its spending on where it was needed most as it stands a family with a household income of nearly will be eligible for the scheme while another where for example one partner works hours a week at the minimum wage in addition to volunteering training or further education will not how is this an effective use of government funding the oecd report rightly argues that when it comes to early years care and education real efforts must be made to reach out to the most deprived families and yet the fact remains that these are the very families who are likely to gain little to no benefit from current government early years policies the report published on wednesday provides evidence that children who have received highquality early childhood education experience better outcomes later in life on an academic level they get significantly better scores in international pisa tests at the age of after accounting for student and schoollevel socioeconomic status students who had attended early childhood education for a year or more scored an average of points higher in the pisa science assessment compared with those who had not pisa points is the equivalent of a school year in countries where the proportion of underthrees in formal education and care is high there is less obesity schleicher said the uk like other oecd countries had made considerable advances in early years care and education there remained however wide variation in enrolment rates and the number of hours available per week countries such as estonia finland greece hungary latvia and poland provide several hours per week to a small proportion of underthrees latvian children get hours a week for example in the netherlands and new zealand fewer hours per week are provided or less to a much greater proportion of children spending levels have risen with countries such as denmark and norway investing most in their youngest over the past two decades many countries have taken initiatives to increase access for disadvantaged children but schleicher launching the report in london said disadvantaged families in many countries still found it harder to secure early years education for their child particularly of the quality they need and deserve of the cohort of yearolds who took part in the pisa tests of disadvantaged students said they had attended early years education for at least two years compared with of their wealthier peers the differences in enrolment between advantaged and disadvantaged students are the largest percentage points in slovenia the slovak republic turkey and the united states leitch said over recent years government policy in england has been increasingly preoccupied with making more cheaper places available to parents with nowhere near enough attention paid to whether or not these places are of good enough quality as this report highlights early years education can have a significantly positive impact on childrens long term attainment but only if the quality of the services being provided is sufficiently high a department for education spokesperson said the government was investing more than ever into childcare spending bn by we are also

gloucestershire county council has been forced to apologise after an ofsted report into its childrens services division questioned the integrity of the senior leadership team and found that serious and widespread failures were putting children at risk the damning report found that the quality of support given to families had deteriorated significantly since a previous inadequate rating of some aspects of its performance in while one area adoption was rated good inspectors described a culture in which relationships between managers and frontline social workers had broken down despite its

council missed the statutory sixmonth target for a permanent decision to be made on childrens futures in of cases an unusually high failure rate nearby bath and northeast somerset missed the target in

homeless immigrants are being told they can secure housing for their children but not themselves effectively forcing them to break up their family or sleep rough with their children the guardian has learned charities around the country working with people with no recourse to public funds have said they have encountered multiple cases in which people approaching local authorities for housing were told social services would accommodate the child but not the parent its very widespread said abi brunswick director of project a londonbased organisation working with families who do not have access to mainstream welfare due to immigration problems she said they had seen at least families in eight different london boroughs in the last year who she says were wrongly threatened with having their children taken into care in our view its a scare tactic to get families to disappear because they are so frightened of having their children taken into care and quite often it does work people are so afraid of having their children taken away that they will put up with living in very substandard accommodation to avoid this perceived threat charities say that as a result some parents who would be entitled to housing and support are too afraid to go to the local authority for help choosing instead to sleep in dangerous situations charities report families often single mothers with children sleeping in the corridor of an apartment block on buses or in overcrowded dwellings with other people after social services refused to help them and of at least two mothers who went into sex work to provide for their family after being turned away by their local authorities legal experts say separating a child from its parents in this way if there are no safeguarding concerns is in breach of the childrens act durani rapozo supervisor of the social work team at greater manchester immigration aid unit said he had seen so many cases of social services saying they would only accommodate children and not parents that its normal now in most of the cases where we do a referral to social services the frontline staff will say we dont have a duty to care for the mum just to care for the child said rapozo he estimated that more than cases in his current caseload involved parents who claimed this had been said to them and said he had seen cases of this occurring in at least eight local authorities in the greater manchester and merseyside areas jennifer blair a barrister from no barristers chambers in london who works with the haringey migrant support centre said she had seen dozens of cases where parents claimed the local authority had refused to help them but offered to take their child in clients constantly say thats what they are told said blair she estimated that more than half of families whose main issue was destitution would face this threat sunny singh a senior caseworker at positive action in housing a homelessness charity in glasgow said that they had seen about cases since the beginning of where parents approached the charity terrified after being told by social services at glasgow city council that the local authority could not accommodate the parents just the child singh said this affected roughly half of the destitute families they had supported if it was two or three clients i might think they were making it up but half our clients or more are saying that these are clients from different parts of the world some from china some from the middle east some from africa why would they all say the same thing and why would they all be in such fear of going to social services said singh a spokesman for glasgow city council said we are fully aware of the difficulties faced by asylum seekers who have no further appeal rights and no recourse to public funds we do look at cases on their individual merits to establish whether support can be provided within the context of what is a complex area of the law its impossible to comment on the cases being referred to in this instance without being made aware of further detail it would help if the third sector organisation making these claims contacts us directly to discuss this issue as they havent already done so valerie clark solicitor at youth legal in putney southwest london said roughly of the clients currently on her books said social services had either said or intimated to them that the only way they would help their child not to be homeless was for the child to be taken into care they are very scared they believe it they think that because its the local authority they know what they are talking about said clark its a ploy to try and scare you away those being threatened include people with no right to work or receive benefits such as those with pending immigration claims immigrants who have left their partners and refused asylum seekers who for various reasons cannot return home blair said that in nearly all of the dozens of cases she had seen the children were born in the uk and roughly one quarter of the children affected were british citizens she said many of these peoples immigration claims were very strong these people are by and large going to be given leave to remain she said advocates say that social workers who tell parents they only have a duty to house the child are failing their obligations under section of the childrens act which requires local authorities to accommodate children in need and so far as is consistent with that duty to promote the upbringing of such children by their families section specifically requires the promotion of the upbringing of a child in need by their family where this is beneficial to the childs welfare said catherine houlcroft project officer from the no recourse to public funds nrpf network at islington council if there are no safeguarding issues identified in addition to the childs destitution then failing to consider whether support can be provided to the family as a whole under section is likely to be unlawful not in the best interests of the child and ultimately will result in a greater financial burden to the local authority rapozo and blair said they had seen instances where women had been forced into sex work to support their children after social services turned them away blair has worked on two such cases it was really grim sex work where they were picking up men on buses or being paid in clothes and food she said she said she had also seen cases where children were removed from the care of their mothers because they had been illegally working to support the family after being refused help by the local authority charity workers told the guardian that when they confronted local authorities about why they had told a parent that only the child would be housed the allegations were routinely denied if we go back to the local authority and say you said this and ask for a record of the meeting they say that definitely wasnt the case that wouldnt possibly be the case but too many people have told me the same thing said jude lancet welfare adviser of the haringey migrant support centre maria houlihan service manager at asylum support housing advice in manchester said she had dealt with a smaller number of these cases three over the last two years but that in one of them she had been told by the social worker that the child would be accommodated but not the parent reading from her case notes made at the time of the incident in december houlihan said she had spoken to a social worker at bury council who had told her were just looking at whether we have got a responsibility to the daughter but we wont be accommodating the family houlihan said she told the social worker she could not make those kinds of threats and asked her if she had been told to say that by managers to which houlihan said the social worker replied yes i dont agree with it but ive been told to say it a spokesman for bury council said the council did not recognise either the specific circumstances of this matter or the general practice we would always assess the situation in line with the childrens act and provide services dependent upon the assessed needs of the children general practice for which there are many examples has been to provide temporary accommodation generally hotel during the period of assessment it is not the practice of the council to seek to separate children from their families solely on the basis on nrpf no recourse to public funds,2017-06,homeless immigrant told secure housing child effectively forcing break family sleep rough child guardian ha

women who are abused by their partner suffer significant physical and mental health problems that persist throughout their lifetime the first longterm australian study to investigate the health impacts of intimate partner violence has found the research led by the university of newcastles research centre for generational health and ageing followed participants from the womens health australia study for years from three cohorts of women born from and were asked during surveys taken throughout their lives whether they had ever been in a violent relationship and about their physical and mental health the study only considered violence from a partner or spouse and not general family violence for example perpetrated by other family members at the start of the study of women born and of women born had experienced intimate partner violence sixteen years later of women born had experienced intimate partner violence compared with of women born of the women born reported having experienced intimate partner violence in the first survey this group were only asked about their experience of intimate partner violence during the first survey given most of those women would be unlikely to have entered into a new relationship but continued to answer questions about their health in subsequent surveys despite the narrow definition of family violence used by researchers the results are striking they write in their findings published in the journal plos one on tuesday across health measures including physical functioning social functioning general health bodily pain vitality and emotional and mental health women who had experienced intimate partner violence recorded significantly poorer health than women who never experienced intimate partner violence across generations and along the life course results for physical health are strongly suggestive of a lifetime deficit in physical health that is associated with intimate partner violence the paper says while health is expected to worsen as people age the physical functioning and general health of women who experienced intimate partner violence was consistently worse than those who had not experienced it while previous research identified similar health problems in family violence survivors this study showed that the issues persisted for years prof deborah loxton led the research and has comprehensively studied the health and wellbeing of women who have lived with violent partners she said intimate partner violence was associated with a higher prevalence of chronic pain and headaches cervical cancer chronic disease and problems with physical function which affected quality of life i think what was really interesting about our findings was that women in their s with poor mental health were more prone to experience domestic violence at a later date she said women with the best mental health at the first survey didnt enter into a violent relationship as commonly as other women so we concluded from this research that poor mental health was a risk factor for entering a violent relationship moo baulch the chief executive of domestic violence new south wales said the findings highlighted the importance of ensuring young women had good mental health and access to health services studies like this show the better we are at early intervention and education the better we can be at prevention baulch said i think we are just starting to have a conversation about how significant the impacts of violence are and what sort of investment we need to make to have a positive impact and change this loxton said much of the focus for interventions and support for family violence was around the immediate crisis period with many people believing that if she leaves then shell be all right unfortunately the reality for one in four australian women is that the physical and mental health impacts of domestic violence could last a lifetime she said we need policies and interventions in place to provide support for the women who are still feeling the impact or years later national sexual assault family amp domestic violence counselling line hours

more than claims for family violence leave have been made by publicsector workers in the past year after the victorian government introduced the clause for staff following the findings of victorias royal commission into family violence the state government announced it would make it compulsory for all new publicsector enterprise agreements to include up to days of family violence leave separate to sick leave since the measure came into effect in mid family violence leave has been included in enterprise agreements across the public sector covering about employees figures provided to guardian australia by the government show that leave claims have been made one year on from the introduction of the measure or of public service employees in victoria research undertaken by the australia institutes centre for future work last year estimated that if days of family violence leave were rolled out nationally about of women and of men would be likely to use it in a given year and that it would have significant economic benefit figures provided to guardian australia found that on average victorian employees took days of family violence leave per claim totalling days the full roll out of the family violence standard in enterprise agreements is expected to be complete by when all existing agreements will have been renewed when complete this will extend the entitlement to more than public sector employees of which are women domestic violence victorias policy and program manager alison macdonald said the private sector was increasingly incorporating family violence leave into contracts for their employees as well she said family violence leave provisions sent a message to employees about the type of company they worked for and that their company cared this type of leave is really taking off and is seen as best practice to include she said we know in nearly every workplace there will be people who would have experienced family violence paul harpur a senior lecturer at the university of queenslands tc beirne school of law said while a small number of people accessed the leave in the victoria public sector so far it would have made a significant difference to their lives it means they can maintain their employment and their economic participation and if they are able to do that it means they are less likely to need welfare support he said this kind of leave is very valuable not just socially but economically in its submission to the fair work commissions awards review the australian council for trade unions argued days of paid family and domestic violence leave should be included in all modern awards victorias industrial relations minister natalie hutchins said family violence leave gave people opportunity and time to leave a violent relationship attend medical and court appointments and find new living arrangements without comprising their job unfortunately in many situations of family violence victims have already used up all of their sick leave entitlements she said they have to deal with physical injuries or mental health issues and sometimes othe family members including children are harmed too by witnessing these situations the

a leading british historian has called on universities to provide more support for childcare to reduce the number of women who leave academia before they reach the peak of their careers starting a family remains one of the greatest obstacles for women who are building their careers as university researchers but too little is done to help them said patricia fara a historian at cambridge university and president of the british society for the history of science because income disparity means men still often receive larger salaries it is women who typically take on much of the responsibility for childcare including the morning dropoff and collecting them from school a report into pay inequality from the institute of fiscal studies found that women in britain earn on average less than men and that the gap balloons after women have children the pay gap widens steadily for years after the birth of a first child leaving women on less pay per hour than men the report found if universities really wanted equality they would invest more money in childcare fara said at the cheltenham science festival it is the single biggest problem the lack of women in senior positions is acute in the fields of science technology and medicine where a report from the commons science and technology committee found that only of professors are women the report found no single reason for the lack of gender diversity but said the steady attrition of women the socalled leaky pipe resulted from perceptions and biases combined with the impracticalities of combining a career with a family in the sciences in particular short term contracts and the high likelihood of having to move home to take up positions in the early stages of a career adds to the uncertainty and insecurity of working in academia fara was at the festival to speak about marie curie on the th anniversary of the scientists birth the youngest of five children and born to poor school teachers in curie went on to study physics and maths at sorbonne university in paris she later discovered radium and polonium with her husband pierre and became the only woman to win nobel prizes in physics and chemistry curie faced discrimination throughout her career and was subject to damaging grillings in the media despite making breakthroughs that paved the way for nuclear physics and cancer therapy and which transformed the role of women in science she showed that you dont have to be either a scientist or a normal woman said fara you can be both a scientist and a normal woman,2017-06,leading british historian ha called

the pay gap much like climate change is probably a myth this anyway is what many people usually men would have you believe even faced with a mountain of data that suggests otherwise and even when they do grudgingly accept stats in women earned of what men earned for instance theyve normally got a personally reasonable notatallsexist explanation for it women just arent ambitious or well qualified they dont ask for raises they drop out of the job market to have children basically its the womans fault what to make then of a new report from the economic policy institute which finds that right out of college women earn about less per hour than their male peers the epi found that while young men age with a college degree are paid an average hourly wage of early in their careers their female counterparts are paid an average hourly wage of just this hourly difference the equivalent of an annual wage gap of more than for fulltime workers is particularly striking as young women have higher rates of bachelors degree attainment than young men whats more because its an entrylevel job its hard to argue that women simply havent asked for raises or arent ambitious enough what one might more plausibly argue however is sexism in the job market women simply dont get the benefit of the doubt while men do bosses focus more on mens potential while women have to prove themselves again and again in the face of thousands of years of ingrained prejudice in order to get to a similar place to that of men take a recent hollywood reporter story about patty jenkins director of the new wonder woman movie for example the very first paragraph of the article states in big bolded letters warner bros gambles m on its first womancentered comic book movie with a filmmaker whose only prior bigscreen credit was an m as was quickly pointed out by numerous people many men have made the jump from small indies to massive blockbusters without it being branded a gamble gizmodo even compiled a list of them it includes the likes of marc webb whose debut days of summer cost m and who then in an pleasing example of nominative determinism went on to direct the amazing spiderman with a budget of m i know im just a woman and all and this might be over my head but sexism seems to me to be the most reasonable explanation for how women are considered and compensated as compared to men and yet it seems to be a very difficult explanation for some people to swallow perhaps because it challenges notions that men just get where they are because of hard work and intelligence and nothing else but whatever the reason there seem to be constant efforts to undermine the validity of the wage gap a recent example of this is an analysis of sampp companies by the wall street journal the journal excitedly announced that while only of these companies had female ceos the women earned more than their male counterparts the female ceos earned a median salary of m last year while the men earned m these figures gave rise to a slew of headlines about the ceo gender gap reversal see the pay gap is a myth which gave rise to another slew of headlines explaining how the first set of headlines were bs bad statistics and indeed the wall street journals analysis is a brilliant example of cherrypicking numbers to pick your narrative heres a more telling stat pointed out fast company consider this pay gap the topearning male ceo charter communications thomas m rutledge raked in m in while the topearning woman hps meg whitman earned m thats a pretty big pay gap and its not favoring women ultimately we shouldnt need more statistics or reports to prove that men and women arent treated the same in the corporate world that should be obvious with common sense and a set of eyes what we do need however is for people at the top to stop trying to prove that sexism is some sort of myth and instead start shifting the status quo,2017-06,pay gap much like climate change probably myth anyway

two women a week die at the hands of a partner or expartner since the conservatives ideological austerity has made it even more difficult for women to leave dangerous relationships thirty four specialist services have been closed since with four in five bme women now being turned away from refuges because of lack of space when they seek lifesaving support sisters uncut has reclaimed the visitors centre of the nowclosed holloway womens prison site in north london in response to this crisis we demand that the government uses the land to support survivors of domestic violence and the local community we have transformed this space of state violence holding a weeklong community festival with activities and workshops the visitors centre was secured by activists who entered via an open window while several protested on the roof and dozens rallied outside after a hour standoff with police the centre was successfully occupied just after midnight on sunday may first opened in holloway was the largest womens prison in western europe and became the first femaleonly local prison in the uk it was closed in after george osbornes july budget symptomatic of conservative policies which target the most vulnerable in our society the women incarcerated there at the time were rushed to the already overcrowded hmp downview and hmp bronzefield in surrey separating many women from their families friends and support networks holloway prison stands on an acre site of public land property agent gva is contracted to manage the sale of the site gva is known for what it calls estate regeneration across london and is linked to the homeless spikes in manchester another luxury private development will not benefit the local community in islington people are on the waiting list for council housing this public land should be used for public good with actual affordable social housing the occupied visitors centre in holloway prison is new and accessible but has been sitting empty and unused for a year it should be opened immediately as a womens building to serve domestic violence survivors and the local community holloway womens prison has a painful history of state violence against women sarah reed was tragically found dead in her cell last year after being imprisoned on remand for allegedly defending herself during a sexual assault the socalled ringleaders of the hunger strikes in yarls wood immigration detention centre were moved to holloway to separate them from other migrants oscar wilde was criminalised and imprisoned for his sexuality here and the suffragettes were imprisoned forcefed and labelled terrorists by reclaiming the site we hope to translate the victimisation of women into an expression of political power giving political agency back to women and nonbinary people prisons are an inhumane response to the social problems faced by vulnerable women nearly half of women in prison report having experienced domestic violence in their past and report experiencing abuse as a child while the closure and sale of holloway could represent a genuine effort to reduce the prison population the tories are embarking on a prison building revolution building new megaprisons in rural areas out of sight and out of mind ten years ago baroness corstons review of women in prison recommended that women should serve shorter community sentences since of women are in prison are convicted for nonviolent crimes despite this the population of women in prison has doubled in the past years on monday theresa may announced a domestic violence and abuse bill which pledges tougher sentences for perpetrators of abuse given that of survivors do not report domestic violence due to fear and a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system this bill is hugely misguided whats needed is funding for domestic violence services may has failed domestic violence survivors despite promises to allow survivors to vote anonymously these plans are not in place for this election for fear of discovery from former perpetrators domestic violence survivors must remain anonymous put at risk by being listed on the electoral roll sisters uncut demands that whoever is

whose fault is it that women get paid less than men this is the question underlying all the fallout from the bbc pay story if we can find who or what to blame we know what to change is it the culture is it men or is it women afraid to ask for what theyre worth the reality is that its a messy combination of all these things but only one of them can be changed quickly how women feel about themselves and their value this is difficult stuff to talk about philip hampton cochair of a governmentcommissioned review into the number of women in senior business roles was reviled last week for saying that the bbc women on the bestpaid list let it the pay gap happen because they werent doing much about it during his career in the city he said lots of men have trooped into my office saying they are underpaid but no woman has ever done that womans hour presenter jane garvey hit back saying he was peculiarly out of touch is he out of touch or is he speaking from experience after all the real story here is not about whether wealthy women at the bbc are paid the same as wealthy men its about the millions of women elsewhere who feel uncomfortable about saying can i have a pay rise this year this is the internalised pay gap and its everywhere or at least anywhere where women in wellpaid jobs feel able to have a say lets not even get started on the lowskilled and lowpaid who never get the opportunity to negotiate their own pay privately many women will admit their internal barriers are a problem and theyve had enough in fact theres an intriguing trend running alongside the bbc pay story rapidly gaining momentum over the past months a new branch of selfhelp has emerged that calls itself money mindset mentoring its aimed at women and is an american trend of course but it has an international audience the term money mindset has over m results on google and rising this idea is championed by jen sincero author of you are a badass at making money yes this is a real book title marie forleo oprah for the next generation and australias denise duffieldthomas motto get rich lucky bitch i interviewed sincero recently at an event where the nearly allfemale audience was hanging on to her every word her books are new york times bestsellers and have been translated into over languages wasnt she duping women i asked by telling them for example that they just needed to trust the law of attraction this is the selfhelp idea that if you ask the universe nicely for something it will give it to you she slapped me down this isnt about wishing on a star she said this is about making concrete plans and naming what you want clearly some of these coaches have indeed figured out how to get rich by getting you to buy their books and courses but others do seem on a genuine mission duffieldthomas who has just launched a new online money bootcamp for women quotes a american express report about the united states where of businesses are owned by women womenowned businesses account for of the nations revenues a figure that has not changed in the past years her mission is to change this by helping women to bust through their money blocks i dont deserve this i cant ask for too much ill only sabotage myself such advice even if it is couched in psychobabble could be the necessary corrective some of these gurus are addressing in simple language what most of us are afraid to admit a lot of women have subconscious prejudices about what they are entitled to ask for in my first job in journalism years ago i found out a male colleague with similar responsibilities to mine was being paid almost double my salary we pay enough to keep you in shoes dont we was my editors response it was true i had a lot of great shoes although at that particular moment i wished i had been coming in in a pair of old flipflops i secured a job offer from a place where i didnt really want to work but would have gone if id had to they matched the salary immediately yes yes yes i know no one should have to do this it should all just be fair and equal and everyone should get a warm glass of milk before bedtime but theres a reason loral poured millions of advertising dollars into the slogan because youre worth it if most women already thought they were worth it this wouldnt need to be said of course there are unconscious biases on both sides of the conversation about pay one us study by researchers at harvard and carnegie mellon university showed that women were seen as tough and unlikable in salary negotiations and judged accordingly men were not if women are judged more harshly for asking for more money the impact of this particular bias is obvious one fascinating aspect to the bbc story is that many of the women in question would not have been negotiating their own salaries so did their agents male or female also internalise ideas about their clients worth gary linekers agent said that the lower pay was the fault of female agents not asking for enough although he also said that he would never buy a house off a woman because they negotiate too hard it seems we are all saddled with preconceptions about money and gender that will take years to unravel in the meantime why not risk being disliked ask for what youre worth be prepared to demonstrate it back it up with examples and counteroffers theres no harm in following advice from the likes of mika brzezinski author of knowing your value and latterly the tv presenter better known for bleeding from a facelift according to donald trump show your boss what you could do in six months and put a number on it dont talk too much while youre asking let them take it in never say im sorry to ask or i have childcare issues no one cares about you and your issues transparency and legislation are crucial of course and perhaps the playing field will begin to level in the uk when it becomes law from april for companies employing at least workers to publish wage figures but such measures are slow and will not solve everything meanwhile the pay gap will take as much busting from inside as from outside the message from sincero badass money mentor woman is this uncover whats holding you back from making money certainly the culture is but women are the culture too change happens with repeated individual microactions or at least thats how it looks from where im standing looking tough and unlikable in these jewelencrusted

a storm has been brewing behind the scenes at the bbc for a number of years now and this week the skies peeled back and the thunder began to roar speak to almost any female journalist at the organisation and they will tell you that there have been concerns about the pay gap between male and female employees for a long time in many cases senior managers were directly asked whether women were on the same pay as comparable male colleagues few enquiries had a satisfactory outcome the female journalists were either ignored belittled or made to feel as if they were being troublesome pay scales within the bbc are a very complex area especially when it comes to socalled talent individuals are on different contracts some freelance some staff some fixedterm different roles have different levels of production input and hours involved and of course there is the thorny but undeniable issue of market value how much does the licencefee paying audience switch on to hear or watch a particular presenter how much would another organisation pay to steal that presenter away my own case isnt entirely straightforward for this reason i get paid around to copresent the bbc live breakfast programme with my good friend and colleague nicky campbell who is on around for the same job although he also presents arguably the countrys foremost daily phonein as part of that hes been presenting on network radio for years and has a much greater public profile than me thanks to his time at radio and hosting wheel of fortune a fact we love reminding him about among other things should we be on the same money probably not i have never argued for that there has to be room for recognising experience and market value i get that ive known how much he is paid for some time weve talked it over frequently and hes been incredibly supportive of me throughout my career in many ways ive directly benefited from working with him and learned from his skills as a broadcaster but its a partnership and we both rely on each other equal jobs should mean equal pay but where there is disparity is the gap justified are the women paid too little or the men paid too much tony hall has acknowledged there is a gender pay gap and it is right and understandable that women now come forward together to ask for action to be taken not some vague aspiration to end pay discrimination by but a coherent plan to encourage transparency and restore faith in the salarysetting system its been amazing and encouraging to see how women across the bbc have come together on this whatsapp groups and email threads are flying around it has thrown up issues well beyond basic pay including the types of contracts being offered to women and changes to terms of employment which may disproportionately affect parttime staff this affects women throughout the organisation people have said to me on twitter why are you making such a fuss isnt it distasteful to complain about a sixfigure salary when nurses are struggling to get from one week to the next my answer to that is simple do you support equality in the workplace if so regardless of your pay or position isnt it right and proper to use your voice when you have one to encourage better working conditions for all your colleagues this week on our phonein i hosted a discussion on pay inequality in other sectors and along other divides age race social class and physical ability if bbcwomen can encourage those conversations and empower individuals in other workplaces to challenge inequality then its a decent use of the licence fee this process may make no difference to my salary at the end of the day and that would be fine by me i get paid a lot of money to do a job i love and i know what a privilege it is to say that my own line manager has been incredibly supportive to me during more challenging periods in my career and has gone some way to addressing my concerns about pay but i stand in solidarity with my female colleagues who are now working hard to make sure genuine progress is made in this area i would personally support some kind of independent audit of all pay across the bbc so that trust can be restored in the organisation and tony halls fine ambition to lead the way on gender equality can be realised the bbc is a fantastic organisation to work for in many ways but being publicly funded it also has a responsibility to set the standard in the future the bbc could be a brilliant beacon for gender equality right across the country and now is the time to seize that opportunity,2017-07,storm ha brewing

the bbc director general tony hall has said he hopes the bbc can close its gender pay gap sooner than after an unprecedented intervention by more than of its most highprofile female stars claire balding newsnight presenters emily maitlis and kirsty wark and one show host alex jones were among those who wrote to hall on sunday to demand the bbc act to correct the pay gap coordinated by womans hour host jane garvey figures published this week of the salaries of the bbcs highest earners showed a huge gulf between men and women with male and female presenters of the same programmes such as newsnight or radio s today programme on significantly different wages balding said the target given by the bbc to achieve equal pay was not good enough given the equal pay act was enacted in and the equality act in were standing together to politely suggest they can do better she said in a letter hall wrote that closing the pay gap had been a personal priority over the last four years and pledged that both employees and the public would see a marked difference once the salaries were published again next year i have committed the bbc to closing the gap by and if we can get there earlier then we will he wrote we are not however making a standing start work is already well underway across the organisation to help achieve this there will be wider consultation meetings over the next two months so we can accelerate further change in the autumn i would obviously value your contribution and thinking as part of this process he went on when figures are published next year i am confident they will look very different over the next three years i want the bbc to be regarded as an exemplar on gender and diversity hall also cited improvements made over the last four years including an increase in the number of women on local radio breakfast shows from to and the corporations aim of a split on all presenting and lead roles by the letter from bbc presenters reporters and stars said the women were seeking to address the imbalance to change the system for future generations the pay details released in the annual report showed what many of us have suspected for many years that women at the bbc are being paid less than men for the same work it reads compared to many women and men we are very well compensated and fortunate however this is an age of equality and the bbc is an organisation that prides itself on its values you have said that you will sort the gender pay gap by but the bbc has known about the pay disparity for years we all want to go on the record to call upon you to act now other stars who have signed the letter include today presenters mishal husain and sarah montague wimbledon host sue barker newsreader fiona bruce live presenter emma barnett and europe editor katya adler the labour leader jeremy corbyn said the bbc needed to look very hard at itself after the pay gap revelations which showed former top gear presenter chris evans took home more than m while its highestpaid female star claudia winkleman received the education secretary justine greening who is also equalities minister told sophy ridge on sunday on sky news it was impossible not to be shocked by the gulf that existed between the highestpaid women and men at the bbc and said it was justification for requiring the bbc to release its salary details i think it has already kicked off a debate for the bbc about these differentials and the steps they will now need to look at taking to close them but it is very hard to justify some of the big gaps that we saw greening said tony halls letter to bbc women in full thank you for your letter i understand and respect why this is so important to you like you i recognise just how crucial this issue is for us at the bbc and for society as a whole it is why i have made it a personal priority over the last four years as i want the bbc at the forefront of change as i said this week we have taken some significant steps forward but we do need to go further and faster i hope the change of recent years is proof of my personal commitment to making this happen when i came back to the bbc i said that we needed to move from having only percent of women on local radio breakfast shows to per cent we achieved that in two years i also said we needed to have a split on all presenting and lead roles by you only have to look at our drama and entertainment programmes to see what can be achieved but we need to do more to close the gender pay gap across the bbc our provisional figures show that the pay gap is against a national average of over percent i have committed the bbc to closing the gap by and if we can get there earlier then we will we are not however making a standing start work is already well underway across the organisation to help achieve this there will be wider consultation meetings over the next two months so we can accelerate further change in the autumn i would obviously value your contribution and thinking as part of this process when figures are published next year i am confident they will look very different when other organisations publish their gender pay data by next april i want the bbc to be one of the best performers when comparisons are made but beyond that over the next three years i want the bbc to be regarded as an exemplar on gender and diversity best wishes tony hall bbc

when the bbc published the salaries of its top earners the results were not surprising but they were shocking they even managed momentarily to silence the gender pay gap mythbusters the trolls who daily patrol social media challenging any mention of a pay gap with supposedly hard facts about the choices women make silence fell briefly as everyone realised that this pay gap didnt care about the privilege of its victims the few female top earners were generally white middle class and nondisabled as horrifying and unjustifiable as the pay discrepancies are the women who made the list earn considerable amounts of money the bbc has also taken steps to improve its diversity its staff and programming still do not perfectly reflect the wider population but compared with some other media organisations it is making progress so what hope do the rest of us have if the pay gap is this wide regardless of the seniority of the staff or good intentions of the organisation here is the real hard fact women are paid less because we are considered to be worth less the gender pay gap is a symptom of the structural barriers that women face which can be seen at every level of working life and across every industry it thrives on the unconscious bias that goes unchallenged by the surplus of white men in decisionmaking roles and is magnified by occupational segregation unequal caring responsibilities and pervasive stereotypes that intersect with class race age sexuality and disability but there is hope in the awareness raised by the report and the sisterhood of the bbcs top women acting in concert as seen by todays joint protest letter because information is power and that is why the womens equality party is calling on other public service broadcasters to follow the bbcs lead in exposing and tackling their pay gaps the truth is that the bbc would never have published this information had it not been compelled to do so by the new terms of its charter and we still have only a partial view of the problem given that many of its highest earners are paid through independent production companies some commentators claim this renders the picture too distorted to be useful in fact a fuller picture is likely to be even more stark in terms of the differences between the mostly white male privatelyeducated top earners and everyone else the holders of channel licences including itv and stv and channel channel and sc are what is known as public service broadcasters that means that they are intended to benefit the public rather than to serve purely commercial interests we have public service broadcasting in the uk because we recognise the fundamental role that culture and media can play in examining and shaping our society and economy the idea therefore that broadcasters should tackle gender inequality only to the extent that they are in receipt of taxpayers money is flawed and lazy they should do so because they have the privilege of being able to do something about it and because it is within their remit so we are asking broadcasters instead of carrying on with business as usual to seize the moment instead of reporting from the sidelines on the bbcs comeuppance and bartering for cutprice female talent they should join the bbc in making this matter for women who will never come close to making the top earners list because turning a blind eye to the extent of this problem will undermine all other efforts to tackle gender inequality in an open letter we demand they publish the salaries of their top earners including those contracted through independent production companies require annual gender pay gap reporting for the whole organisation to be broken down by age employment status ethnicity race disability and working hours and gather data on retention during and up to a year after parental leave they must also publish an action plan on how they intend to close the gender pay gap these channels are important they should reflect and promote the uks diversity if public service broadcasting is really for public benefit then let it benefit the whole population,2017-07,bbc published salary top earner result surprising

i can add my own story to the bbc pay brouhaha in the s as social affairs editor one of four newsroom editors leading specialist departments i was the only woman and by reliable gossip i was near as dammit certain i was paid a lot less than the rest i plucked up courage to ask one of them rumoured to get double my pay for advice if i told him what i was paid would he advise me whether i should ask for more he grunted what i wrongly took to be assent so i told him what i was paid he said he couldnt possibly comment and walked away with his nose in the air women in senior positions are still so surprised and grateful to be there at all they tend not to ask for equality gender age and ethnic disparities in pay and prominence matter but frankly its quite hard to get worked up about the plight of some very well paid people being paid a bit less than other very well paid people looking through the keyhole at bbc top pay may be fun but it misses the big picture yet again the bbc is the nations crucible stripped bare by exposure of its pay rates its myriad enemies the mail the murdoch press and rightwing politicians have whooped with glee at how this enforced revelation has embarrassed the corporation needless to say no disclosure of top mail and sun writers and editors pay followed what should be a great national debate about pay and values is reduced to an oohaah fingerpointing at the corporation for reflecting the society it inhabits what matters a thousand times more is the gigantic scale of pay disparity from top to middle to bottom in britain the real fascination driving the bbc salaries story is yet another reminder of the breathtaking distance between high and low pay at least with bbc pay for talent we can see what we get for the money and these sums dont begin to compare with the grotesque booty ftse ceos pay themselves i visit company agms to watch their ceos oneday squirm at trying to justify monstrously unjustified rewards share price productivity and profits can all sink yet their pay still rises inexorably even the conservative manifesto inveighed against it promising to legislate to force listed companies to publish ratios between executive pay and the rest of their workforce companies will have to explain their pay policies pointing to the pay differential between top and average that grew from in to in but dont hold your breath for this cabinet bringing in any radical reordering of rewards the high pay centre keeps close track a nurse is paid per year while a ftse ceo gets m more than times more he yes usually he gets four times more in a year than she usually she gets in a lifetimes work labours manifesto promised a strong disincentive to companies paying over the odds by charging firms a levy on any earnings above and on those above good idea any such suggestion is always greeted with horror by the right remember how john majors government warned labours manifesto plan for a minimum wage would lose m jobs if this miserably insular country ever looked across the channel to our close neighbours we would see how similar countries can share incomes and wealth much better and their economies thrive we boast of how many jobs have been created a good thing but we have a high proportion of fulltimers earning less than twothirds of the median in britain earn that small a share while only in switzerland and in belgium earn so little if our top earned the same share as denmarks top then everyone else could be better off the high pay centre calculates these are the political choices we make though voters are wrongly persuaded that they are economic inevitabilities how do we make the attitudinal change start with total transparency what has begun with the bbc should become the national norm make all

the bbcs gender pay gap is not so much a single chasm as a series of geological faultlines the most egregious discrepancy is that top rates of pay are skewed towards men by twothirds and that onair talent is doing remarkably similar jobs for very different rewards the broader difficulty it raises is the gap around who gets to do what in the first place all media organisations have pay differentials and most need to look at them more rigorously they all should feel the heat over the way they remunerate and promote women the bbc is in a particular category however as it has come under increased pressure to justify its funding its defence has been that it is the purveyor of journalistic values at a time when they are threatened by disruption to the economic model of quality journalism and a more divided public mood as a regular contributor to the bbc i would argue that these are vital characteristics some of the more jawdropping amounts in the bbcs rich list do though open up glaring questions about the balance between the broadcasters desire to be a purveyor of public service values and the amount of effort and dosh that goes into preserving and rewarding its marketable assets yes that is the result of a desire to preserve its reach alongside a public service remit but the consequences of a negotiating culture seemingly unwilling to say no to bigmoney demands or to watch stars walk away is a weighting of rewards that look like the private sector splashing shareholders cash the broader point which the bbc has been reprehensibly slow to act upon is that the skewing of rewards is symbolic of broader challenges of who gets to do what and how easy or not it is for them to progress the major presenters from chris evans to graham norton are predominantly male even national treasures such as clare balding receive far less remuneration than the golden boots of gary lineker lets not look only at the top ranks further down the scale chaps on radio and tv still get the lions share of explaining how the world works a fellow female broadcaster tells me that female managers are as prone to lionising men in these roles as any male suit and i think she has a point the bbcs intellectual spadework is still done mainly by men of a similar outlook and type director general tony hall should get on with changing that but distortions will persist until broadcasters think more adventurously about what women are capable of it is to that extent similar to the situation of female politicians at a gathering this week attended by the home secretary amber rudd many of the new intake of female mps spoke of a determination not to fall back into the old world of approved ie limited portfolios for women they have no sense at all of being more likely to be confined to say education or environment while male peers aim for defence or chancellor the bbc has made strides not least with appointing laura kuenssberg as political editor and strong women fronting the today programme who will i suspect be negotiating rather more firmly in future pay rounds now that their male colleagues incomes have been laid bare beware though a tendency to reply weve got kuenssbergmishal husainemily maitlis as if one amber rudd or emily thornberry would resolve the gender skew at westminster so if hall director of news james harding and the alpha males at the top want to do something about this now is the time too many redoubts in tv and radio reflect an unambitious view of what women are suited to broadcasters tend to veer from one diversity challenge to the next rightly there is an overdue focus on ethnic representation no presenter from a minority background figures in the top end of the pay scale but these concerns must not be excuses in which the unspoken message is done the women thing got to do the minorities one now what holds women back most in broadcasting is in my experience a lack of reliable support for them to do more finding the doors into many roles is still as mysterious as locating platform at kings cross station yet it would be churlish not to acknowledge that new brooms in the hall era are starting to sweep dusty corners sarah sands now edits the today programme where a former editor once assured us that women were too thinskinned to take the pressure joanna carr has risen to become head of current affairs nonetheless appointments procedures are still far easier for internal candidates to navigate than outsiders and favourites tend to go unchallenged these processes need to open up not just to tackle groupthink but because an impartiality that is curious and questioning rather than just balance boxticking needs a breadth of interests and outlook wherever in the workplace this is not the time for women to shut up about unequal chances i suspect many will feel galvanised by the lifting of the bbc pay veil and if their bosses start with the excuses they can now come armed with the wa rich list and a pair of

advocates of pay transparency believe it has the power to transform a companys internal dynamics they say it can incentivise workers and build a sense of fairness and trust its critics believe that it can lead to unnecessary or unhelpful rancour the bbc finds itself forced to conduct a very public transparency experiment by critics in government and rivals in the media whose concerns have nothing to do with corporation morale or governance and everything to do with trying to cow an institution that challenges their worldview and sometimes their bottom line forcing the bbc to publish details of what it pays its highestearning stars falls into the category of things that are utterly fascinating to the public why is casualtys derek thompson the highestpaid actor without contributing very much at all to the public interest to most people even the lowestpaid bbc star earns a sum they can only dream of the exminer who called the jeremy vine programme this morning to ask if he thought he was worth the that his listeners now know hes paid raised the most fundamental question there is about salaries how do you judge the value of someones work the bbcs answer is that it is decided by the market and despite the secrecy of its rivals in the field there is certainly some evidence to back the claim ant and dec are reported to have signed a threeyear deal worth m last year while adrian chiles back at the bbc for a mere went to itv with a m package netflix apple and amazon are all in what is now a global market for creative talent paul dacre the editorinchief of the bbcs leading newspaper critics the mail group is paid m before he counts his share options most people still disregard the likes of mr dacre and accept that the bbc overall is good value at less than a week but those critics are dug in for the long haul while the bbc may be able to ride out the row over how much some stars are paid and the absence or underestimation of others such as david dimbleby because they are employed through an independent company the shocking gender pay gap that this limited transparency has exposed should make the bosses hang their heads in shame it is unforgivable that gary lineker earns up to times as much as clare balding or john humphrys three times as much as his fellow today programme presenter mishal husain in every sphere where pay has been revealed the men are earning more than the women usually a lot more even when they sit side by side in the studio doing what to most people looks very much like the same job in its defence the bbc claimed the pay gap for its top earners was better than most and much better than the national figure of the governments new pay gap reporting website instituted in april proves the bbcs case but it is not an excuse twice as many men as women feature in the list of top earners and the difference on average is likely to be repeated and magnified lower down the bbc pay scale particularly among those paid least lord hall the director general points to recent more genderequal recruitment but that cannot hide the corporations deepseated problem with diversity even on screen the bbc can look pale male and stale its election coverage was a notable example behind the camera it is much worse in a speech at parliaments portcullis house on tuesday sir lenny henry said that while the bbc claims nearly of its staff are black asian or minority ethnic that includes administrative staff and those working for the world service the figure for bame people responsible for making tv programmes is probably closer to he pointed out the national broadcaster must identify and recruit talent wherever it can the bbc is a reluctant participant in this exercise in transparency lord hall argues that it will inflate the cost of talent without achieving better value for the licence fee payer it is unpleasant for individuals to justify their pay its imposition as part of the charter renewal negotiations was clearly politically motivated and will almost certainly be exploited in the future yet as a way of tackling inequality transparency can be an effective weapon difficult of course in a longestablished organisation where some traditions and some staffers have a history going back over many years but also valuable and after more than years progress on fair pay and equal opportunities is still so slow that anything that advances it must be welcome the bbc has to fight its corner in a highly competitive marketplace but that is no excuse for employment policies that are anything less than transparently

theresa may has been urged to review the gender balance of the governments eu negotiating team in a letter signed by female labour mps who say brexit is now becoming just another job for the boys the signatories including seema malhotra yvette cooper harriet harman and labours women and equalities minister sarah champion argue that leaving the eu will have a significant impact on the lives of the whole population yet there is only one woman among the nine senior civil servants listed by the department for exiting the eu as members of the core team for the two years of talks while women form of the uk population of parliament of the shadow cabinet and of your current cabinet women form only of the uks eu negotiating team one out of nine our european counterparts on the other hand have women in nearly half of their teams positions they write they argue that the process by which britain will leave the eu will have major implications for the whole population with a number of specific concerns for women brexit negotiations will need womens voices on mainstream issues like the economy as well as on directly addressing for example how we maintain workplace rights much of which are underpinned by eu legislation a wateringdown of workers rights would impact women the most from maternity leave to discrimination in the workplace malhotra the mp for feltham and heston who is a member of parliaments brexit select committee said may claimed to care about women and their rights but this just isnt reflected by her actions as prime minister it is staggering that she has allowed our negotiating team to have as low a level of womens representation as parliament had years ago her administration should be leading the way not taking us backwards she said the danger was that women would emerge from brexit with fewer rights harman who has long argued that the eu helped shore up womens rights in the uk and that brexit could pose a risk to hardfought victories said the lineup of the department for exiting the eu looked like the kremlin in the s this is the old boys network at the top of the civil service laid bare this is not a meritocracy it is a boys club no one should believe that the men are better than the women this a selfperpetuating oligarchy of men at the top of the civil service and it is out of touch with modern britain she said the department put out the names of the nine key players in negotiations last month starting with oliver robbins the departments permanent secretary and his deputy philip rycroft others include director generals in key departments including alex ellis mark bowman simon case and glyn williams the prime ministers national security adviser mark sedwill and sir tim barrow who is effectively the uks ambassador to the eu the only woman on the list is catherine webb who is director of market access and budget following several roles during years at the treasury and a senior position at the british embassy in beijing a

every morning during termtime two million single parents in the uk drop their children off at school or childcare many of them were trying to keep their toddler distracted while attempting other tasks applying for a college place for example or attending a baby group in the local childrens centre all the single parents ive met since i started my role as chief executive at gingerbread have consistently told me the same thing that stability and wellbeing for their children is their number one priority when it comes to their decisionmaking thats why its so insulting to see the headlinegrabbing comments of paul coleridge founder of the marriage foundation in lieu of promoting marriage he seems more interested in demonising unmarried families hence his statement that an epidemic of family breakdown is fuelling terrorism this would be concerning if it was true after all one in four families with the children in the uk are headed by single parents but theres no epidemic the proportion of families headed by a single parent has remained about the same for nearly years there is also no credible evidence that being raised in a singleparent family is inherently harmful when it comes to the development of children and while marriage is often a wonderful thing all the available analysis suggests that in fact parental conflict rather than parental separation is the factor that is most likely to have a negative impact on children in the long run of course there are challenges associated with raising children on your own we know from both our research and the myriad calls we receive daily on our helpline that it can be difficult for single parents to juggle all the demands put on them but it is poverty that is the actual problem here lack of money rather than some inherent lack of stability is what those concerned with the welfare of children should be focusing on so rather than providing financial incentives to get and stay married in other words providing additional support to those who are likely to need it the least here are three policy areas the government should be addressing a lack of flexible work and affordable childcare two thirds of single parents are in work and more would be if childcare was affordable and readily available but even then work in itself isnt a financial cureall the largest increase in child poverty is seen in working singleparent families with many single parents falling into the just about managing category we need more flexible work opportunities at all levels which can fit around parental responsibilities and provide opportunities to progress beyond lowpaid roles failure to collect child maintenance while flexible work and childcare policies would benefit society as whole a specific concern for singleparent families is that the majority of single parents dont receive the child maintenance to which their children are entitled theres a staggering bn owed in maintenance since most of which the government admits will probably never be collected on top of that the child maintenance service is opaque unhelpful and riddled with loopholes a punitive welfare system single parents are disproportionately likely to be affected by the benefit cap which arbitrarily limits the amount of government support nonworking families can receive even when living costs continue to rise in june the high court ruled that the benefit cap specifically discriminated against single parents with children under the age of two a group which understandably struggles the most to get into work the government has already announced that it will appeal the ruling and its not just outofwork families bearing the brunt working single parents on low incomes have been targeted by the cut to the universal credit work allowance in the context of all this where singleparent families are bearing the brunt of austerity rhetoric like that of the marriage foundation will only promote stigma rather than solutions next year gingerbread will celebrate its centenary marking a century of support for single parents we look forward to a time when policies empower them and where language that demonises them is resigned to the past,2017-07,every morning termtime two million single parent uk drop child school childcare many trying keep toddler distracted attempting task applying college place example

whos worth more the radio presenter who grills evasive politicians on behalf of the nation every morning the carer who drops in on your elderly parent three times a day the footballer whose skills you admire so much the head of one of our most prestigious universities or the cleaner who freshens up your hotel room the simplest way to answer this question lies in how much they get paid footballers top the league lionel messi has just become the worlds first footballer to clear m a week the vicechancellor of the university of bath the countrys top paid university chief commands a salary of more than we will know on wednesday how much john humphrys gets paid when the bbc publishes the salaries of its stars on more than a year at the other end of the scale our story this week reveals the spanish women cleaning the hotel rooms of british holidaymakers typically earn less than a year the care sector is one of the worst culprits when it comes to noncompliance with national minimum wage legislation the resolution foundation has estimated frontline care workers collectively miss out on over m a year due to nonpayment of the legal minimum however it seems obscene that a university vicechancellor might be worth more than times someone doing emotionally and physically difficult care work as soon as we start to probe the philosophical basis of our grounds for assessing what we deserve questions about the financial worth of someones work become much more complex what are we looking to reward effort or natural talent or some mix of the two why is it fair that someone born with the raw talent to excel at sport could go on to make so much more than someone who doesnt isnt this just brute luck this is perhaps why its rare in the popular debate to see high pay justified purely with reference to what we deserve instead its defenders tend to hide behind the market we need to pay people extortionately to attract the top talent no doubt this is the argument the bbc will make this week when it defends the salaries of its top stars however the market defence deserves far more scrutiny it is often made most strongly in relation to the private sector the chief executives of britains biggest companies are in a position to demand multimillion pound salaries if they dont get them they will simply move elsewhere while average wages have stagnated since the financial crisis ftse chief executives have seen their average pay shoot up from just over m in to almost m in the corporate sectors dirty little secret is that far from this being a case of the market reigning supreme it is a symptom of likeminded wealthy people scratching each others backs jobs arent advertised board pay is negotiated behind closed doors by a group of people on sixfigure salaries who want to be seen to be paying their chief executive in the top quartile to send a message about the status of their company hence corporate pay continues to ratchet up the situation is worse in the financial sector where banks that had to be bailed out with tens of billions of pounds by the taxpayer continue to pay fatcat bonuses to their staff but its not just the private sector in the public sector the argument that great people might instead depart for the private sector is used to justify huge salaries at taxpayer expense ignoring the nonfinancial cachet of these jobs more than university vicechancellors now earn more than a year the chief executive of the harris chain of academy schools who earned almost a year in has seen his salary increase by more than since meanwhile several top universities regularly employ academics on zero hours contracts and average pay rises for teachers and nurses have been frozen then capped at since the truth is that high pay is rarely driven by unique talent or market forces instead its a reflection of the cultural value society puts on different kinds of work we place little value on work largely carried out by women such as

rich working mothers should have their maternity pay cut in order to fund higher payments to the poorest parents according to a new commission backed by three former tory cabinet ministers the measure is among proposals to improve parental rights drawn up by the bright blue thinktank which champions liberal conservatism the plan would change current rules that give highpaid mothers of their weekly salary for the first six weeks after their childs birth the savings from lowering the entitlement should be spent on increasing the minimum weekly amount given to lowpaid workers after the first six weeks off work they are currently paid the lower of a week or of their average weekly wage for up to weeks while employers pay statutory maternity pay they claim all or most of the money back from the taxman former cabinet ministers dominic grieve maria miller and caroline spelman were all on the commission that backed the measure miller the former culture secretary and equalities minister said workplace changes over the past decade have not always translated into improvements for british mums over the past years levels of maternityrelated discrimination have doubled and some pregnant working women now dont even have the right to paid leave to attend antenatal medical appointments to safeguard their babys health these recommendations from bright blue could help reshape attitudes toward pregnant women at work and create a long overdue culture change which better reflects this countrys laws values and beliefs the yearlong bright blue commission is proposing dozens of policies covering human rights and discrimination other proposals to help new parents include a radical plan for universitystyle loans to pay for childcare it would see poorer parents given a governmentbacked loan for formal childcare for underfives parents would pay their childcare loans back only when they are working and earning above a certain income bright blue also backs the right to request flexible working for new employees under current rules they must have worked for continuous weeks with their current employer it also calls on the government to force all companies to keep track of the gender pay gap with the data kept anonymous and released to researchers so that a greater evidence base can be built the commission also backs the abolition of employment tribunal fees for all basicrate taxpayers james dobson a senior researcher at bright blue said the policies would help theresa may fulfil her pledge to tackle burning injustices as she entered downing street the prime minister committed herself to addressing the burning injustice which means women earn less than men he said yet the gender pay gap remains stubborn we know one of the primary causes of the gender pay gap is

a damning report about women in local government has found that at the present rate of progress councils will not see equality until the final report of the fawcett societys local government commission found that just one in three councillors is a woman and that only of councils have maternity leave provision for councillors threequarters of the organisations that responded to a freedom of information request had no formal maternity paternity or parental leave policy in place for councillors the report the result of a yearlong study led by the fawcett society in partnership with the local government information unit lgiu concludes that local government is not fit for the future as a result of a range of outdated practices and attitudes that hold back gender equality it found that sexism is commonplace in local government with almost four in female councillors having experienced sexist comments from within their own party and a third having experienced it from other council colleagues this finding helps to explain why just of council leaders are women the reports authors said a figure that has hardly shifted for years just of all councillors in england and of councillors in wales are women the report also revealed that women are outnumbered six to one in finance or economic development roles which usually lead to the top jobs in cabinet local elections in may saw next to no progress in the number of women councillors elected the report states at the current rate of progress in english county councils it will take years for us to reach gender parity in welsh councils it would take years we cannot wait that long margaret hodge a senior labour mp and cochair of the commission said she had led a council for years ago and was shocked at how little progress has been made to make local government work for women womens representation has barely increased far outstripped by the pace of change in parliament she said councillors still do not have maternity rights sexism remains rife my party is moving in the right direction when it comes to getting women elected as councillors but still far too few make it to the top that is because the way councils do business has been designed by and for men the picture seems even worse for women in the new devolved combined authorities all six elected metro mayors are men and just of combined authority representatives are women diversity is also a problem through the consultation researchers heard that many women from minority ethnic backgrounds had experienced racist comments from other councillors giving evidence to the commission muslim women councillors in particular described pressure from men within their community not to engage with politics half of all disabled women councillors said they had experienced discrimination the commission found that of council seats went to incumbents at each election making it very difficult for women and minority groups to break through of councillors who had served for years or more three in four were men sam smethers chief executive of the fawcett society said the picture was common across all political parties with just one in three local councillors being women the pace of change is slow smethers said the report makes a number of recommendations to help drive change to get more women in to the roles the commission calls for all parties to set targets for getting more women councillors in and make it a legal requirement to get women candidates if they dont make progress it also calls for the government to introduce a statutory maternity paternity adoption and parental leave policy for councillors and to ensure childcare and caring costs are covered,2017-07,damning report woman local government ha found present

a senior female mp has questioned whether parliament should change the rules governing its powerful select committees after it emerged that only of candidates running for chairmanship roles are women jess phillips who chairs the womens parliamentary labour party argued that the figure was disproportionately low given that almost a third of mps are women and said her party was doing all the heavy lifting the figures show that only three conservative women have put themselves forward for the elections which take place in parliament on wednesday compared with men meanwhile eight of the labour candidates are women while are men this should lead to questions about the culture in conservative ranks that lead to this its fine to talk a good game about diversity but if we actually want to see change real action is needed said phillips perhaps it is time for parliament to look at the rules for selection of these powerful roles in order to make sure that when the public turn on to watch them newspapers and broadcasters report on them and visitors come to see them that our parliament looks more like the people we represent overall committees which hold the government to account on issues ranging from the economy to education health and brexit have an allmale shortlist just six are certain to have a woman at the helm but only because they are each unopposed however harriet harman who is the longestserving woman in parliament argued that there was also a positive story to tell because female mps were frontrunners for some of the most influential groupings parliament is going to be stronger and more important than it has been for a long time not only because of the issues facing the country but because of the weakness of the government the select committees are going to be even more important and we could be set for a major breakthrough of women leading important ones she pointed to the conservative nicky morgan running for the treasury position labours yvette cooper meg hillier and mary creagh who are unopposed at home affairs public accounts and the environmental audit and rachel reeves vying for the role at business harman who has been the leading voice in parliament for womens representation for decades pointed out that female mps often served shorter terms because they were selected for more marginal seats as such they might not be as likely to be seen as reaching the necessary level of seniority she said meaning this weeks elections did mark progress but more could be done,2017-07,senior female mp ha questioned whether parliament change rule

babies whose mothers have voluntarily agreed to them being temporarily looked after by the state are at risk of adoption by stealth a leading family support charity has warned according to a freedom of information request by the family rights group babies under six months old of them under six weeks old have been placed with foster carers who are already approved as suitable adopters since fostering for adoption legislation came into force three years ago it is not clear how many have been permanently adopted previously under section of the children act the assumption was that parents who voluntarily gave up their children to foster care could immediately reclaim them if they chose to do so but the addition of the fostering for adoption legislation means that in some cases parents who may not fully understand the consequences of their decisions could find the fostering arrangement turned into permanent adoption against their will under the fostering for adoption system the babies mothers typically have no right to free legal advice to enable them to grasp that they can very easily lose their children forever cathy ashley chief executive of family rights group said that when vulnerable mothers are asked to agree to social services accommodating their children and placements are then made under the fostering for adoption scheme without the mother having had access to legal advice it is deeply unfair and unjust to the mother and the child it is much harder to get a baby back than it is to keep a baby when its not been removed she said so it can be adoption by stealth the freedom of information request to all local authorities in england showed that when children over six months old are included in the figures have been accommodated by social services with parental agreement since under section and subsequently placed with foster carers who have been given the green light to adopt however answers from the local authorities that responded to the charitys foi questions demonstrated divergent approaches with councils indicating that they do not use section voluntary accommodation and fostering for adoption together in those local authorities that do ashley said whats really shocking is the number of very young babies who this is happening to very soon after birth its not legal to permanently relinquish a baby under six weeks old but mothers are being asked to sign voluntary arrangements below that age with their babies then placed with a foster carer whos a potential adopter ashley said it was deplorable that with the stakes so high in fostering for adoption cases there is no automatic right to free legal advice or any independent judicial oversight of whether the statutory significant harm threshold for a childs removal has been reached in the first place this is in contrast to parents rights when a local authority issues formal care proceedings in this situation they are immediately entitled to free legal advice and representation in court should they contest social services application to take their child into care section accommodation has recently been the subject of severe judicial criticism with concerns about social workers coercing parents to consent to section voluntary accommodation for their children under the threat of formal care proceedings ashley says that she thinks coercion can sometimes come into play as it is highly questionable whether a young woman in the immediate postbirth period without legal advice on the implications of her decision can give informed consent once a baby is with foster carers who are approved as adopters it is much harder she points out for a mother to get her child back when the case eventually goes to court for an adoption order youre up against the argument that you shouldnt unsettle the baby from the people theyre living with who unlike ordinary foster carers are offering that baby a permanent home it is undoubtedly far more difficult for a woman to get her baby back than to contest a care application and keep the child when it hasnt already been removed i do think there are risks in using section and foster to adopt says john simmonds director of policy and planning at fostering adoption organisation corambaaf fostering for adoption simmonds explains was introduced as a means of reducing delays for children beginning a lifelong relationship with people who would become their parents but he continues it is vital that the birth parents are absolutely clear about any local plan for their child and what it means they should have access to legal advice to help them with this family rights group says it repeatedly raised concerns with government ministers before the fostering for adoption legislation was passed ashley said that worries about how it would be used in relation to voluntarily accommodated children were cited the department for education dfe responded by stating in guidance that fostering for adoption for children under voluntary arrangements is likely to be unusual but our survey reveals it is being used routinely by some local authorities the charity is now calling on the government to ensure that as an absolute minimum parents who are asked to sign voluntary accommodation agreements receive access to legal advice equivalent to entitlement when a local authority is considering applying to court for a care order we also believe that local authorities should not be using fostering for adoption placements for children accommodated under section without a family court scrutinising the local authoritys case said ashley,2017-07,baby whose mother voluntarily agreed temporarily looked state risk adoption stealth leading family support charity ha warned according freedom information request

amy now had her first child aged while she herself was still a child in care she was living with her sixmonthold daughter in a motherandbaby unit until one day the funding for her placement ran out there wasnt any plan for us she explains it all happened in a rush at oclock on a friday afternoon the unit manager refused to keep us there even until the monday so the social worker said to me just put her in foster care while we help you sort out your housing i was still breastfeeding at the time i wasnt given any paperwork to sign and left my baby with social services on the understanding that they would help me find accommodation that was suitable for us both with nowhere else to go and herself still a child supposedly in the care of the state amy had no option but to stay with her violent exboyfriend she went to her appointment with social services on the monday morning there was still no paperwork and they said it would take them time to find me a house she remembers i know housings hard to get but i dont think they really tried when the local authority then decided to do a parenting assessment amy says they used the fact that id gone back to a domestically violent partner to say i wasnt fit to look after my baby and then obviously my mental health got worse because of the stress that id lose her at no point was it suggested that amy should get independent legal advice fostering for adoption legislation was not in place at the time but the leading family support charity family rights group fears that under this legislation which was introduced three years ago many more parents could find themselves in positions similar to amys because many babies will be fostered by carers who are already approved as suitable adopters and does not stipulate legal aid for parents amys baby was adopted without her consent and she has not seen her since she was months old amy says she feels tricked into giving consent to section accommodation because they didnt tell me that if you go back and live with this violent expartner then well use it against you but i had nowhere else to go and they knew that the effects of losing her baby have been devastating i tried to commit suicide she says there was zero support nowhere to go when amy had another baby a couple of years later she once again in difficult circumstances and against her better judgment agreed to her youngest daughter being voluntarily accommodated that baby was soon adopted too im very angry says amy i genuinely think they had it planned all the time because its easier to take a child into care than it is to support a family its affected my whole life ive had mental health problems because its very difficult to lose two children i dont think ill ever get over that pain and i dont have the ability to trust anybody especially anybody in authority any more amy now has an monthold son who lives with her and warns parents being asked to agree to section to always get legal advice never hand your child over unless the police come there can be two or three or more professionals there and they dont always give you time to understand things the only way i found out that under section you

this week the jersey care home inquiry into the sexual and physical abuse of hundreds of children drew conclusions that sounded all too familiar the report found that young people felt they had no outlet to raise their concerns they told us that they are not being listened to some of the grave problems that were found with haut de la garenne and jerseys other childrens homes are specific to those institutions however there is a danger that by focusing on extreme cases like jersey we risk missing a much wider problem the routine and continuing lowlevel mistreatment and neglect of societys most vulnerable children i lived in childrens homes and foster placements from the age of to neither i nor any of the children i grew up with felt we were being listened to we felt helpless victims of injustice in just one relatively minor case a child who had been misbehaving in the homes laundry room was grabbed by one of the carers and removed by force leaving a friction burn on the childs arm when we went to the office to complain we were told to stop causing trouble the carer who said that the child had burned themselves on an iron was defended by the office staff the impact of small incidents like this repeated over time escalates the feelings of helplessness most of the problems in the childrens homes i grew up in were a result of neglect in one of the homes we werent encouraged to attend school wash or even get out of bed this neglect also had more serious implications a lot of the girls i grew up with were allowed to get into cars with plus yearold men and nothing was really done about it some of these girls would become pregnant but due to their age their babies would be taken from them in another care home i lived in children would regularly be restrained by the staff if they were seen as posing a danger to themselves or others which often meant for relatively innocuous indiscretions like mouthing off or attempting to leave the premises one technique the staff favoured during these restraints was to arrange three chairs next to each other they would place the child in the middle and two carers would take a seat either side locking the childs arms to their waist with one hand and pushing the childs head into his or her lap with their other one day i was locked in this position and felt so enraged and helpless that i spat on to the floor in frustration another carer who was in the room took my spit from the carpet and wiped it on my face the thought of complaining after this incident didnt even cross my mind i even felt i might have deserved it i had seen far worse things happen to other children with no action taken as a consequence this is why if were to end incare abuse there needs to be much more than a bureaucratic complaints procedure which children seldom use or even understand during all my time in childrens homes and foster placements i cannot recall being visited a single time by someone independent of the home or social services to ask us how we were doing or what we thought about the staff and how we were being treated the fact is children in care are not being listened to and being ignored filters into a childs psyche why would anyone listen to me is a question i have carried with me well into my adult life since leaving care i have run into many of the kids i grew up with almost all of them have experienced hardship whether it be through drugs and alcohol addiction imprisonment or homelessness and many of the girls i know had babies before their th birthday but none of them have even considered looking back at the treatment and lack of support they received in the care system they still dont realise they were owed so much more the abuse and neglect occurring in childrens homes is not ancient history its endemic throughout a bankrupt system in desperate need of investment and reform addressing the serious abuse of children should not rely upon a scandal like the one in jersey but now this has come to the fore those responsible for the care of children must take action as a society we say we have a duty of care towards vulnerable children who are estranged from their family

vulnerable children facing being taken into care are more likely to end up in care proceedings if they live in northwest or northeast england than those living in london or the southeast research has found the findings from lancaster universitys centre for child and family justice research highlight a stark northsouth divide the research funded by the nuffield foundation shows that the northwest of england registered the highest rate of care orders in with courts agreeing to of care applications compared with london which had the lowest rate in the capital just a quarter of applications resulted in a child going into foster care or being placed for adoption prof judith harwin who coled the study to be published on monday said our finding that children living in the north have significantly higher risk of ending up in care proceedings says to me that childrens vulnerabilities to risk are unequal and children are bearing that risk she added the northeast and northwest account for of all children but also for more than a third of all care proceedings that forces the question why the likelihood of a child ending up in care proceedings also depends on where they live the incidence of care proceedings in the northeast in was found to be per compared to outer london where it was about per attitudes to how much risk family court judges and local authorities are willing to bear once care proceedings are under way appear to vary dramatically across the country too with children in london three times more likely to be returned to their families on supervision orders of cases than in the northwest which had the lowest rate of supervision orders at just the inconsistency of approach between regions raises questions about the fairness of the system harwin said whether the decisions being made by childrens services and family courts are fair or not still requires further analysis she said and could not be more urgent the research carried out by harwin and prof karen broadhurst responds to concerns about the soaring demand for care places which was recently described by sir james munby president of the family division of the high court as a looming crisis that was putting the care system under unsustainable pressure munby said it was his analysis that changes in local authority behaviour must be playing a significant role in the rise by contrast it turns out that all regions are behaving in a consistent and similar way when it comes to special guardianship and placement orders that lead to adoption special guardianship has increased nationally while placement orders that sever family ties have gone down broadhurst who specialises in research into repeat care proceedings where multiple babies are removed from mothers at birth said it was well worth examining the differences and similarities between local authority approaches it looks like infants are dealt with very consistently across the country with figures showing a big jump in removals in recent years broadhurst said when you remove a child at birth and if youve had one baby removed theres a likelihood of a subsequent one being taken it means the local authority has decided theres problem before its started decisionmaking in the second set of proceedings is often very preemptive in the majority of cases these babies are born healthy so local authorities may be placing too much weight on the history of the case and are insufficiently open to parental change if reducing demand for care places is a priority as the system struggles to cope broadhurst suggests that based on our data one avenue of inquiry would be to look at those second removals and see if for example more residential motherandbaby placements could be offered that she said could make a significant reduction to approximately baby removals each year broadhurst said the findings must prompt action weve been concerned about the disproportionate removal of children from poor areas since the s so why arent we doing anything about it and why is resource allocation not more closely aligned to deprivation the headline of this article was amended on july to correct an editing error and to

bosses are punishing parents for taking their sick children to hospital according to a shocking tuc study that finds many lowpaid workers are disciplined for taking time off for childcare one mother who works in retail said my baby stopped breathing and i had to go to hospital i got threatened with a disciplinary another mother working in social care said that when she had to rush her son to aampe because he was having difficulty breathing she received a call from her manager asking when she would be back at work some managers have no sympathy she said the report found of parents felt penalised at work if they asked for flexible hours with some fearing they might lose their job a further said they struggled to balance work with parenting despite legal changes in the past decade intended to make it easier for parents to spend time with their children the tuc based its findings on a survey of more than people with combined household incomes of or less respondents were on a variety of contracts including some on permanent contracts who also had irregular hours and were only told about shifts at short notice the study found of parents had to use annual leave in the last year when their child was sick many workers were unaware of their right to weeks unpaid parental leave if they have held their job for a year kirsty arthur from cornwall works parttime in retail and is on maternity leave she said when my son was ill i would take time off work but if you have an absence percentage higher than then you have to go through a disciplinary process i was only working four shifts a week so if i missed a few shifts to look after my son then that really pushed my percentage up so every time i came back i had to go through that process which was a bit demoralising and the more times i had to go through that disciplinary process then the more upset the bosses got with me frances ogrady the tuc general secretary said many parents fear losing shifts taking unpaid leave or being viewed badly at work if they need time off to look after their kids and it is shocking that some mums and dads are being stopped from taking their children to hospital when they are sick its time the government changed the law so everyone gets at least a months notice of their shifts they need to make sure everyone at work can get the same parents rights from day one and that everyone knows about those rights prof nicole busby the acting head of the law school at strathclyde university described the findings as shocking but said they would come as no surprise to lowpaid workers there is a right to request flexible work but this is of no practical use to those on zerohours contracts who often dont even know their working hours in advance even where it does apply it is merely a right to ask for a particular arrangement and your employer can refuse on a range of different business grounds sarah jackson the chief executive of the charity working families said parental rights are meaningless if parents cant use them for fear of being seen as unreliable or of getting special treatment workers blamed an irregular hours culture with many saying their employer could change their shift on a whim one in four parents said they had their shifts changed at short notice the tuc is calling for all workers to have the right to be notified of their shifts one month in advance it is campaigning for all working parents including those on zerohours contracts to have the same parents rights the union said these rights were only available to workers with employee status meaning million will not have these rights if they become parents busby said to give working parents real choice about how they balance paid work with family commitments the government needs to ensure that workers are provided with guaranteed working hours and that individuals feel able to ask for suitable adjustments as and when family circumstances require them without fear of repercussions there is also a real need for affordable good quality childcare which is accessible for all working parents as this would go some way to removing the daily anxiety experienced by lots of parents a department for business spokesperson said the continued strength of our economy is built on the flexibility of our labour market more than million people in the uk are eligible to request flexible working and businesses must have a legitimate reason to refuse a request we commissioned matthew taylor to review modern working practices to ensure our employment rules and rights keep up to date to reflect new ways of working we are considering his report carefully and will respond in due course,2017-08,boss punishing parent taking sick child hospital according shocking tuc study find many

children from families most in need will receive a startlingly low proportion of government spending on early years education and childcare a report warns the report which was published on thursday by labour mp lucy powell and the social market foundation smf found that a mere m worth of the extra bn of spending over the next five years will reach the most disadvantaged uk families it also found that the governments new childcare spending will largely be enjoyed by the wealthiest parts of the population the smf figures showed that around of the spending will go to families in the top half of the population by income the report in particular criticises the governments houraweek offer for free childcare for infants aged three and four years which is to begin operating nationally next month powell said with a singular focus on early years policies which subsidise the already welloff the government is leaving disadvantaged children lagging further and further behind powell the mp for manchester central and a member of parliaments education committee said the uk lagged far behind other countries in tackling disadvantage and promoting social mobility far from addressing this over the next parliament this is set to get significantly worse with just of new money for early education and care dedicated to the most vulnerable children and only a quarter benefiting the bottom half by income of families this huge skewing of resources seriously risks a widening developmental gap between disadvantaged children and their better off peers at the age of five creating a lost generation who will struggle to ever catch up powell said before the reports publication the research looked at the total new spending on early years education and childcare projected for and found that government policies skewed distribution towards a collection of retail political offers to parents the bulk of the additional bn comes in the form of taxfree childcare for three and fouryearolds the majority of extra funding appears to be going to higher income parents with children from the most deprived backgrounds more likely to miss out there are concerns that the hour expansion could damage early education and care as it stands pushing up the price for parents and reducing quality the smf report claims evidence from pilot areas suggests competition for a limited number of places means that school nurseries and maintained preschools will have to prioritise those wanting hour provision and so halve the number receiving the current allocation of hours per child powell proposes replacing the taxfree childcare with more progressive childcare support with universal free early education from ages one to five she said ministers should scrap tax free childcare and reverse their inheritance tax giveaway refocusing this investment to close the preschool attainment gap forever,2017-08,child family need receive startlingly low proportion government spending early year education

the womens minister anne milton has accused sir philip hampton who is leading a government review of the role of women in business of failing to understand the barriers facing women in the workplace after he suggested female bbc presenters were partly to blame for allowing the gender pay gap to happen milton is the first minister to contradict the remarks made last month by hampton a highprofile businessman who is chairing a government review looking at increasing the number of women in senior corporate roles i think philip hampton did not fully appreciate some of the barriers that women face i dont think he fully understood the barriers that women face milton said she was speaking as the government launched a scheme that will establish new training courses and support for parents returning to work after taking time out to look after children and those who have had breaks to care for elderly or disabled relatives asked whether there was any truth in the idea that women less often asked for pay rises milton said women like to do things properly and i think they are probably less demanding and the reasons for that are complex none of these things are straightforward and none of them are reasons why women should be paid less than men absolutely not it is inexcusable hampton said last month that bbc women paid less than their male costars had let it happen and claimed women had never asked him for pay rises in contrast to their male colleagues at the time no declined to comment directly on the remarks after an outcry from senior women in politics and broadcasting hampton later insisted he was not blaming women but acknowledging differences in behaviour under the governments new equalities scheme the first programmes using money from a m fund announced at the budget will be for social workers civil servants some health professionals and teachers ministers are particularly keen to help women returning to work after children because the gender pay gap of increases to among workers in their s milton said there were economic reasons why companies should not neglect female talent in their workforce but her main reason for supporting the policy was about encouraging women to fulfil their potential women returning to work sometimes settle for something slightly less she said on average womens earnings decrease by for every year they have off so over say an eightyear period your chances of earning are significantly reduced the senior mp who was elected at the age of after a career as a nurse said the overall gender pay gap was not closing sufficiently quickly change is not happening fast enough she said look back to the second world war when women were beginning to work in factories weve shifted but not far enough but she argued that legislation forcing big companies to disclose their pay figures by april next year would be a first step towards changing corporate attitudes and the institutional sexism that she said still existed it is a wakeup call to organisations to say if there is a gap why do we have a gap and ask are we missing out on the female skills of the workforce she said the scale of the gender pay gap in some sectors was underlined last month when the bbc was required to publish the salaries of its highestpaid stars showing that only onethird of its top earners were women and the top seven were all men with male copresenters frequently earning more than their female colleagues while stressing the bbc was just one organisation milton said diversity of workforce is good for an organisation so why dont they recognise that why did the bbc not recognise the value of the women i dont know milton said she thought employers should take the lead in reducing the gender pay gap but there also needed to be wider shifts in attitudes in society towards accepting more flexible work and the sharing of domestic labour nothing is inevitable and that is where it gets quite complex she said i think there are attitudinal shifts that are necessary women even in fulltime work tend to perceive that they are responsible for the childcare even if they are not doing it who employs the childminder and who sorts out the nursery is it always the woman or is it sometimes the man we need to find out a lot more about that sort of thing if you are both working fulltime and have friends round for supper who cooks who bears responsibility for how dirty the lavatory is who takes on things its something as women we do for ourselves there are cultural and attitudinal things we do need to shift,2017-08,womens

with each year comes a new wave of data about hollywood salaries and with each year they remain astronomical ascendant and to no ones surprise inequitable recently released studies by variety concerning television salaries and forbes detailing the highestpaid actors in film attest to an industry thats outmoded exhibit a its persistent gender and racial pay gap and adapting to a future shaped by cashcow streaming services such as netflix amazon and hulu some statistics from these studies will shock no one the stars of the big bang theory for instance remain the most handsomely compensated on television after contract restructuring kaley cuoco johnny galecki simon helberg kunal nayyar and jim parsons are to earn per episode and dwayne the rock johnson a boxoffice juggernaut and actionmovie mainstay is again near the top of the forbes list having raked in m last year for his work in the films baywatch and jumanji and on the hbo series ballers the rock topped last years list but was dethroned this time by mark wahlberg but theres more to be gleaned from the numbers than just how deep the pockets of alist actors are they show among other things that hollywoods superheroindustrial complex is mainly a boys club that television as has long been suspected is kinder to women these days than film is and that streaming services and cable networks emboldened by big gambles that paid off are aggressively courting actors with the meaty roles and lump sums they once earned in film for men the money is in sequels and superhero franchises mark wahlberg who came in as the topranked actor on the forbes list made the brunt of his income from daddys home and transformers the last knight both sequels the trend continues after marky mark as the list is mainly comprised of actors whove starred in uberlucrative franchises or bigbudget superhero movies films for which there are conspicuously few female roles theres vin diesel the fate of the furious robert downey jr spiderman homecoming tom cruise mission impossible chris hemsworth thor ragnarok and chris pratt guardians of the galaxy to name a few welltodo capewearers and action sequel dwellers the women on the list by contrast earned their keep in slapstick comedies or awardsworthy dramas emma stone in la la land amy adams in arrival jennifer lawrence in mother mila kunis in bad moms and melissa mccarthy in ghostbusters but women and minorities still make significantly less the variety and forbes lists show significant gender pay gaps while emma stone dethroned jennifer lawrence for the title of highestpaid female actor she was just the th highestpaid actor last year with men receiving more than the highestpaid woman moreover the top male actors on the forbes list hauled in a cumulative m last year while the same crop of women a list including stone lawrence jennifer aniston watson and mccarthy earned m as forbes notes the disparity has a lot to do with the roles being offered wellpaid gigs in blockbuster franchises and superhero movies most often go to white male actors while there remains a dearth of opportunity for women and minorities across the board not a single woman of color appears on the forbes list while just two kerry washington and sofia vergara are among televisions highestpaid actors a usc study from last year found that in feature films from women made up just of all speaking roles in television the number marginally improves but remains shy of the study also analyzed the prevalence of minorities in film and television but noted the percentage of underrepresented speaking characters did not meaningfully vary by media platform they found that just of speaking roles were performed by people of color showing the disproportionate nature of available roles compared with the broader ethnic makeup of a country where nearly of inhabitants are racial minorities so theyre moving to tv where the disparity is less extreme the horse race between streaming services such as netflix amazon and hulu plus the continued strength of cable networks like hbo showtime amc and fx has lured to television some of the industrys biggest names robert de niro for instance clocks in as the highestpaid drama actor on television for a show that hasnt even aired and doesnt yet have a name hell make per episode for his forthcoming amazon series a mafia drama developed and written by the silver linings playbook director david orussell and costarring julianne moore only the stars of the big bang theory a network comedy whose ratings remain untouchable earn

varietys earnings report sit the much younger stars of much younger shows that in their debut seasons were praised by critics and showered with love by awards bodies many of these shows such as nbcs

her performance as the young queen elizabeth the emmy frontrunner claire foy earned just per episode and the stars of the hugely popular this is us mandy moore milo ventimiglia sterling k brown chrissy metz and justin hartley took in between and per episode for an episode season for atlanta a show he created wrote and stars in donald glover made just per episode although its likely that number will increase the fx comedy was universally beloved by critics and its fanbase is expanding the numbers suggest that while television is more than willing to shell out big paychecks for unreleased and unproven shows featuring movie stars de niro stone thornton its understandably more conservative when negotiating with young guns even if their shows are equally successful now that

reporting child neglect were dealt with by the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children in the last months the charity said a growing number of callers were concerned about children some under the age of five being left at home unsupervised by parents struggling with alcohol and drug use however it warned the true scale of the problem could be much greater and urged the government to commission a national study to measure the extent of the problem the nspcc chief executive peter wanless said neglect can have severe and longlasting consequences for children and can also be an indicator of other forms of abuse it is vital we understand the true nature and scale of child neglect in the uk so we can collectively tackle the fundamental causes therefore a governmentcommissioned nationwide prevalence study on child abuse and neglect needs to be conducted and sooner rather than later according to the nspcc child neglect was mentioned in more than a quarter of calls to its helpline last year the charity received reports of child neglect in compared with in a increase the department for education which has been running a campaign to encourage more people to report instances of child abuse and neglect said the government was investing m in the childline service and giving m to the national crime agency to tackle online child sexual exploitation a spokeswoman said we are helping to make sure people feel confident about reporting abuse and neglect through our national awareness campaign and are improving the way the police social services and other agencies work together to keep children safe however a report released a fortnight ago by action for children suggested tens of thousands of children were being failed by local authorities in england kate mulley the charitys director of policy and campaigns said investment was needed in early stage intervention as vulnerable children were only receiving state help at crisis points we know that raising awareness of the issue means that there are more referrals but its what happens next its what happens to the children mulley added when weve spoken to professionals particularly those working in child protection services they were well aware of the issues but the problem is the lack of resources to do something about it her charitys research found that children were falling through the cracks in the system and that although these children were highlighted as needing help they did not meet the criteria for receiving statutory support mulley added the government simply cannot continue asking local authorities to provide childrens services with one hand tied behind their back savings targets have left them with little option but to close family support services that are proven to spot and address the signs of neglect before its too late we urgently have to reinvest in communitybased family support services to prevent this crisis spiralling,2017-08,report child

access their accounts thompson said the number of people experiencing significant difficulties was low around of all applicants and said the system was on course to meet the department for educations

the equality and human rights commission is right to highlight that progress on closing the gender pay gap is woefully slow advertise all uk jobs with flexible working to tackle pay gap august it will take another years before pay equality is reached according to analysis by deloitte one of the main problems is the lack of women at the top specifically at executive board level a recent report by lord davies set a target of of board positions on ftse companies to be held by women by it currently stands at according to boardwatch however to meet targets many of those companies have been proactively targeting female nonexecutive directors with far fewer appointments at executive level although nonexecutive positions are important and certainly preferable to no female representation these directors are less visible and have less voice in the drive for change it is women in executive board positions who have the real power they are role models to other women have greater visibility operational responsibility and can implement policies that importantly drive through real cultural change deborah casale employment lawyer london join the debate email guardianletterstheguardiancom read more guardian letters click here to visit gucomletters,2017-08,equality human right commission right highlight progress closing gender pay gap woefully slow advertise uk job flexible working tackle pay gap august take another year pay equality reached according analysis deloitte one main problem lack woman top specifically executive board level recent report lord davy set target board position ftse company held woman currently stand according boardwatch however meet target many company proactively targeting female nonexecutive director far fewer appointment executive level although nonexecutive position important certainly preferable female representation director less visible less voice drive change woman executive board position real power role model woman greater visibility operational responsibility implement policy importantly drive real cultural change deborah casale employment lawyer london join debate email guardianletterstheguardiancom read guardian letter click visit gucomletters,"['equality', 'human', 'right', 'commission', 'right', 'highlight', 'progress', 'closing', 'gender', 'pay', 'gap', 'woefully', 'slow', 'advertise', 'uk', 'job', 'flexible', 'working', 'tackle', 'pay', 'gap', 'august', 'take', 'another', 'year', 'pay', 'equality', 'reached', 'according', 'analysis', 'deloitte', 'one', 'main', 'problem', 'lack', 'woman', 'top', 'specifically', 'executive', 'board', 'level', 'recent', 'report', 'lord', 'davy', 'set', 'target', 'board', 'position', 'ftse', 'company', 'held', 'woman', 'currently', 'stand', 'according', 'boardwatch', 'however', 'meet', 'target', 'many', 'company', 'proactively', 'targeting', 'female', 'nonexecutive', 'director', 'far', 'fewer', 'appointment', 'executive', 'level', 'although', 'nonexecutive', 'position', 'important', 'certainly', 'preferable', 'female', 'representation', 'director', 'less', 'visible', 'less', 'voice', 'drive', 'change', 'woman', 'executive', 'board', 'position', 'real', 'power', 'role', 'model', 'woman', 'greater', 'visibility', 'operational', 'responsibility', 'implement', 'policy', 'importantly', 'drive', 'real', 'cultural', 'change', 'deborah', 'casale', 'employment', 'lawyer', 'london', 'join', 'debate', 'email', 'guardianletterstheguardiancom', 'read', 'guardian', 'letter', 'click', 'visit', 'gucomletters']",120
a gender imbalance across local government has been exposed in a damning report that suggests councils especially the new mayoral authorities are lagging behind even westminster in taking steps to improve equality the study published on sunday by the institute for public policy research reveals that only of councillors and of council leaders in england are women something the thinktank suggests is causing a democratic deficit in the new mayoral combined authority boards only of constituent members those with full voting rights are women and all six bodies are led by men the west midlands cambridgeshire and peterborough the liverpool city region and the west of england authorities are all without any female constituent members the ippr calculates that to achieve equal numbers of male and female councillors in england more women need to be elected an increase of more than on the or so currently in power the thinktank estimates that to achieve parity in gender balance more than women would have to apply for elected positions on councils the shortfall means many policies that have a direct impact on womens lives are being drafted at the local level by male councillors with little practical experience of the issues at stake the report power to the people tackling the gender imbalance in local government amp combined authorities finds that women face a number of barriers to entering local government and progressing into leadership roles despite calls from politicians on all sides for more women to enter politics the percentage of female candidates selected by parties to stand in council ward elections has flatlined at around a third since by contrast there have been much faster gains in parliament the number of female mps elected rose by in the general election compared with in the past years the proportion of women councillors has grown by but at this rate it will take another years to reach equal representation labour mp jess phillips said it was time to consider a change to the law councils and public bodies in the future need to look at whether they want to have targets that lead to local action without a target or a quota nothing is going to change despite a new generation of young women participating in politics with voter turnout among women aged to reaching at the last election compared with just in the report finds that political parties are failing to engage more women with the result that they are less likely to go on to become local councillors women make up only of labour party members and only of conservative party members it cannot be right in that there are barely any women represented in the leadership of our newest democratic institutions the combined authorities said clare mcneil ippr associate director efforts made to address this in greater manchester and elsewhere are to be welcomed but radical change is needed if devolution is to be about bringing power to the people rather than consolidating it among white middleaged men the report states many local government policy areas have a much greater impact on women than on men for example local government has oversight of childcare provision as well as responsibility for delivering and funding social care women who in still shoulder the greatest burden of caring responsibilities in the family are simply more affected by decisions on who gets statefunded care and how it is delivered the ippr wants leaders of political parties to commit to achieving a balance in malefemale party membership and it wants authorities to make a commitment that at least of those on combined authority boards are women if significant progress towards greater gender balance in local government and combined authorities cannot be achieved through these changes then it says legislation should be introduced requiring elected positions to be filled equally by genders or with a split of or better political institutions and parties must introduce more ambitious quotas to improve representation in the short term mcneil said and local government should do more to encourage women to stand and support them effectively once they have been selected without these measures representation will continue to be deeply unequal leaders of political parties should back our call to recruit the women needed to stand for election to achieve a better gender balance in local government by this would be a fitting way to mark next years anniversary of years since the first women got the vote marianne overton vicechair of the local government association believes that

widening gaps at one in four government departments over the past decade figures in the ehrc report show that while the gender pay gap is there is also an ethnic minority imbalance of and a disability pay gap of while the differences are smaller than between men and women there are stark contrasts for certain groups male bangladeshi immigrants had the largest pay gap of compared with white british men while men with epilepsy earn less than those without the condition despite these figures most female ethnic minority groups had a pay advantage over white british women research from the resolution foundation thinktank published earlier this month found that minority ethnic families in the uk earn as much as a year less than their white british counterparts men with depression or anxiety have a pay gap of about while women with mental health problems earn less according to the ehrc report the research also shows that women disabled people and people from ethnic minorities are more likely to be paid less than the national living wage of per hour for over s the ehrc said the public sector has a smaller gender pay gap than the private sector while countries across europe in

leftwing men cant live with them cant shoot them instead they can be splattered with faint praise for being wellmeaning jess phillips the marmite mp i love marmite has taken a little pop at lefty men at the edinburgh book festival she was asked about the behaviour of men on the left and said they are the absolute worst sexists they claim that they want to see women treated the same as men but they are guilty of benign neglect and dont really fight for gender equality they were worse she said than the out and out sexists of the right phillips has long been critical of jeremy corbyn surrounding himself with male advisers although his new cabinet now has more balance but she was stirring about more than just corbyn she is surely right when she says many men pay lip service to better female representation but when it comes to risking their own jobs say oh you mean me but i am so clever ive got so much to offer the world she added that women were entirely missing from the labour partys industrial strategy because that was all about men with shovels this may be broadbrush stuff there are a lot of brilliant women in the labour party who battle away but it remains embarrassing surely that the tories have had two women leaders and labour none leadership is one issue and culture another but they are connected many men on the left hum the tune of antisexism they just have no idea of the words the far left is dire on womens rights better at commemorating dead revolutionary women its cult leaders engage in abuse while reassuring us that gender equality can only flourish after the class revolution historical memory omits mo mowlam or even harriet harman current mps like luciana berger naz shah or stella creasy are told they are never good enough and of course its a shame they get abuse but what matters is their support for corbyn with what they do for women coming second some of this is personal and some of it is political but it is certainly isnt the leaders fault alone it is the product of the kind of male leftism that is prevalent now the hopeful populism of football chants and absolute boydom is fun maybe the laddishness of slagging off melts and liberals as heretics is part of the fandom a little macho a little silly what is more serious though is that the preoccupations of these guys are pretty regressive as far as feminism is concerned cuttingedge issues are the rights of trans people and sex workers thats fine but where else do womens concerns figure sure i was pleased when momentum provided a creche at its conference but much more needs to be done and addressed take surrogacy ivf postcodes midwife shortages cuts to dv shelters trafficking tampon tax the pay gap and social media abuse just for a start reproductive rights only became an issue for the many men on the left when the dup were brought into alliance with the government this reminds me of prochoice marches i used to go on when men came along and demanded to walk at the front the phenomenon of grooming gangs should not be used to fuel racism but for the left to deny the scale of child abuse and its relationship to patriarchy is a cop out male sexuality is surely not something that has passed leftwing men by on their way to the high moral ground surely there can be no discussion of neoliberalism austerity and automation that leaves out gender but that is what is happening of course race and class interwine with this too the sexism of leftwing men is often simply down to an absence of selfreflection it too often manifests in them telling us how to do feminism properly for only they understand what the priorities are as for us we should just wait our turn,2017-08,leftwing men cant live cant shoot instead splattered faint praise wellmeaning jess phillips

tens of thousands of vulnerable children in england flagged to social services because of neglect or abuse are not being offered any help by local authorities a report warns research by the charity action for children warned that children were only getting help when they reached crisis point and that they were ending up in a revolving door of being rereferred to services it found that children were falling through the cracks in the system these are children who were highlighted as needing help but did not meet the criteria for statutory support sir tony hawkhead chief executive of action for children said many children were simply falling through the cracks social care cant just be there for when a family is in meltdown he said every day too many childrens lives are overshadowed by drugs alcoholism domestic violence and neglect a toxic recipe for all kinds of problems now and in later life responding to the report richard watts chair of the local government associations children and young people board said it rightly highlighted increased pressures he said in many areas services were being pushed to breaking point by law councils must provide services for children deemed in need or at risk of harm but setting this threshold has always been controversial in most cases a social worker will assess whether a child needs statutory support when a child does not meet these criteria he or she should be referred to other services including parenting programmes however action forchildren said this wasnt happening the report was based on a series of freedom of information requests to councils in england the charity found that in childrens needs assessments were closed as no further action because they did not meet the statutory criteria for help of these around one in four families received other help through services such as being referred to childrens centres leaving an estimated children with no further assistance the charity blamed austerity measures that they say had led local authorities to drastically shrink or abandon services leaving a large number on the fringes of social care statistics show of children in the uk live in poverty and over children are homeless or living in temporary accommodation the lga estimates there will be a bn funding gap to support vulnerable children by a study by ofsted in found that if children dont get help early their problems get worse and they are often rereferred to social services the report found regional variations the numbers of children who didnt get any help was highest in the southeast and london and lowest in the northeast of england the early intervention grant designed to help families who need support before crisis point has been cut by m since the lga said it will drop by a further m by watts said not all referrals will need a formal intervention however and referrals closed with no further action will not necessarily leave a child in need it is important that local authorities and their partners work closely to help children and families to access the support they need when they need it he added councils are facing a bn funding gap for childrens services in just three years time its more important than ever that the government commits to the life chances of children and young people by acting urgently to address the growing funding gap a department for education spokeswoman said councils will receive more than bn for local services up to and spent nearly bn last year on childrens social care but we want to help them do even more our m innovation programme is helping councils

it will take the civil service more than years to achieve pay equality between men and women and one in four government departments and agencies have seen the gender pay gap widen over the past decade according to a guardian analysis data shows that the average male civil servant in is paid and the average female employee a gap of or down only slightly from in labour said it was morally wrong for such a gap in pay to exist in the civil service and feminist campaigners said the public sector should be leading the way on the issue but the cabinet office said the gap was at a record low and the government was committed to closing it in a generation figures covering the period from and reveal that the gap has widened in out of government departments or bodies the office for budget responsibility obr a very small organisation was the worst offender on average with the gender pay gap rising by percentage points from in to the gap at the attorney generals office which also has few staff grew by points to men averaged per annum and women business energy and industrial strategy is one of the worst of the major whitehall departments with a gender pay gap in at the cabinet office which oversees civil service pay the disparity has grown by two percentage points since to ministers have promised to take action on the national gender pay gap which stands at in both the public and private sectors all employers with more than staff will have to publicly report their gender pay gap in the next year sarah champion labours spokesperson for women and equalities said it was appalling that the governments own departments harbour this level of pay and disparity between men and women it is not only morally wrong it makes no economic sense she claimed tory ministers had turned a blind eye and allowed discrimination to flourish on their watch the conservatives were happy to talk the talk on the gender pay gap she said but they had been dragged into taking action on inequality the fawcett society a campaign group for gender equality and womens rights said public services should be leading the way in closing the gender pay gap so its disappointing to see that progress has been so slow in the civil service if government is committed to delivering the best possible public services we cant afford to wait almost years for the gap to closea cabinet office spokesperson said the most recent ons report shows that overall the civil service gender pay gap has narrowed but in small organisations it is very sensitive to minor changes in staffing the pay gap is affected by differences in seniority profession and regional distribution of staff which can be very different across departments and are not controlled for in the raw data in autumn this year we will be launching our new diversity and inclusion strategy which outlines plans to achieve our aim of becoming the most inclusive employer in the uk by the strategy will set out how we will continue to improve the gender balance of the civil service at all levels including in the most senior posts both the obr and the attorney generals office stressed that they were very small organisations in which minor staffing changes could make a big difference to the average an obr document released in response to a freedom of information request shows that the department has a number of senior male economists and that the figures are more equal at senior levels although campaigners argue there is still a problem to be addressed justine greening the conservative minister for women and equalities and the education secretary has stressed the importance of organisations opening up about the pay gap in order to trigger action im proud that the department for education has taken an important step in reporting its gender pay gap setting an example to other employers as we build a stronger economy where success is defined by talent not gender or circumstance she said last month bbc figures revealed a gulf between the pay rates of highearning men and women the data showed that male and female presenters on the same shows such as newsnight and radio s today programme were receiving significantly different amounts a string of highprofile women including clare balding emily maitlis kirsty wark and the one show host alex jones were among female stars who wrote to the bbc director general tony hall to demand action hall responded by saying he hoped to close the gap before the civil service figures which come from the office for national statistics to which departments report their data annually reveal a mixed picture some departments such as education scotland and the department for international development have made progress on the pay gap the scottish public pensions agency and the driver and vehicle licensing agency have maintained pay parity between the sexes from to the department for work and pensions and new brexit department have no pay gap while the departments for education and transport are at a number of others the wales office the criminal injuries compensation authority and the national archives have reversed a pay gap over the past decade where women were previously paid more with men now having higher median earnings a spokeswoman for the obr said the size of the organisation meant raw pay differentials did not provide a meaningful likeforlike comparison of pay fairness and were volatile because of staffing movement salaries at the obr are set within ranges that reflect the responsibility of posts and the experience and expertise required of them she said the obr board and management certainly believe that we should and do pay our female staff fairly we are also determined to attract excellent female staff at all grades and we would not want movements in misleading metrics like these to deter us from doing so,2017-08,take civil service year achieve pay equality men woman one four government department agency

threequarters of councils have overspent their childrens services budget by a total of more than half a billion pounds as a growing financial crisis engulfs childrens social care council leaders have warned analysis by the local government association lga which represents more than councils in england and wales has revealed that in of councils exceeded their childrens social care budgets by a total of m at the same time the lga said councils are dealing with an unprecedented surge in demand for childrens social care support with a increase in child protection inquiries in the past years the lga analysis also highlighted the particular shortfall facing early intervention work as a result of a m cut in government funding since with further projected cuts of m by which will represent a overall reduction the reality is that services for the care and protection of vulnerable children are now in many areas being pushed to breaking point said richard watts the chair of the lgas children and young people board councils have done everything they can to respond to the growing financial crisis in childrens social care including reducing costs where they can and finding new ways of working however they are at the point where there are very few savings left to find without having a real and lasting impact upon crucial services that many children and families across the country desperately rely on according to watts childrens services are facing a bn funding gap by with early intervention at greatest risk as councils struggle to deal with growing numbers of children and families already at crisis point he said there is no question that early intervention can help to limit the need for children to enter the social care system lay the groundwork for improved performance at school and even help to ease future pressure on adult social care by reducing the pressure on services for vulnerable adults however cuts to the early intervention grant have exacerbated a difficult situation where councils cannot afford to withdraw services for children in immediate need of protection to invest in early help instead more than children were subject to child protection inquiries in compared with in and the number of children on child protection plans increased by almost over the same period in the face of growing demand and dwindling budgets the lga says councils have been forced to make tough choices childrens centres and youth centres have closed since according to the government spending on childrens social care has gone up by about m since to nearly bn last year every single child should receive the same highquality care support and protection no matter where they live a government spokesperson said councils will receive more than bn for local services including childrens social care up to this is part of a historic fouryear settlement which means councils can plan ahead with certainty councils are doing excellent work spending nearly

minority ethnic families in the uk earn as much as a year less than their white british counterparts according to a study bangladeshi and pakistani households earn about a third less on average than the median for white families while earnings in black african families are typically about a fifth less the resolution foundation thinktank found however the study also said bangladeshi households experienced the fastest income growth in real terms between and while pakistani households income grew in that period differences in living standards between ethnicities in britain too often go ignored said adam corlett the senior economic analyst at the foundation this matters because income gaps between different minority ethnic groups and white british households are significant and persistent however we should be encouraged by the fact that there have been big improvements in some instances such as the impressive employment gains seen among black bangladeshi and pakistani men and women thanks to this and other factors since the turn of the millennium bangladeshi and pakistani households have actually seen the fastest income growth the report found that typical bangladeshi household incomes were or lower than the white british median for pakistani households the deficit was and typical black african households earn less the thinktank said the gaps were even larger when housing costs were taken into account it said that more than half of white british families owned their homes compared with only a quarter of bangladeshi black and other white which it defined as primarily european as a result the disposable income gap between white british households and bangladeshi households increases to when housing costs are considered it said the analysis suggested that while still significant the gaps had narrowed in places the income growth for bangladeshi households for example was nearly three times the rate of white british families while pakistani households also made up some ground theresa may promised during the general election to tackle the injustice of pay inequality saying firms should be made to disclose how pay rates vary by ethnicity from next year large companies will have to report on the extent of the gender pay gap in their businesses last year the prime minister announced an audit of how people of different races are treated by public services including examining relative incomes but she has been criticised for postponing the publication of the report until autumnfollowing the release of the resolution foundations analysis on monday the prime ministers spokesman said this is a hugely important issue which is why the prime minister ordered a race disparity audit to confront and address unfairness in the system we have never shied away from the fact there are disparities between how people are treated depending on their race we remain committed to addressing these issues headon and will be publishing the results of the audit in the autumn the foundation said the gap between the employment rates for men and women partly accounted for the income disparities it said a pakistani or bangladeshi woman was about half as likely to be employed as a white woman though that rate represents an increase and may explain some of the recent improvements in those groups living standards the thinktank added employment rates for pakistani bangladeshi and black men have also increased substantially with growth of and six percentage points respectively since while the rate among white men has been flat,2017-08,minority ethnic

two years ago i opened an email with a job offer it contained lots of flattering things about how great i was and how much the organisation wanted to work with me it also contained a takeitorleaveit salary offer that was explicitly nonnegotiable if employers such as the bbc are serious about closing the gender pay gap banning individual pay negotiation is a policy they should adopt as well its worth mentioning i quite like negotiating my salary i started out in a pr agency where i learned pretty quickly that if i didnt advocate for my own pay rise i wasnt going to get one i had some positive early experiences where i asked for more money and was given it but most research shows im the exception not the norm there is plenty of evidence that employers respond differently when men and women ask for a pay rise one particularly depressing study found women who asked for more money were penalised for it as they were perceived as demanding and not nice ive experienced this firsthand in a job that allowed negotiation but like the bbc also made peoples salaries public when i spotted two men were being paid more money but doing equivalent jobs to mine i raised it with my manager he got offended that i thought he was sexist and reported me to hr experiences such as this teach some women its better not to ask they also show up as ridiculous the likes of sir philip hampton the cochair of a governmentcommissioned review into increasing the number of women in senior business roles who said women at the bbc allowed the pay gap to materalise in fact these studies suggest that by not negotiating women may be adopting the best possible strategy in a sexist workplace this is undoubtedly reflected at a national level women working fulltime in the uk earn on average less than men and the gap is much wider for parttime workers and black and minority ethnic women so why allow employees to negotiate for most of us being good at negotiating your pay has nothing to do with how good you will be at your job the job offer i got from my current employer the global consumer group sumofus said every employee should be paid the same whether or not they are a good negotiator that made sense to me and it was a relief to know the offer was takeitorleaveit the salary i was offered was based on the organisations pay grades which all staff members have access to and can only change when i get promoted or for a costofliving increase the result a recruitment process that focuses on testing candidates for the job they applied for which eliminates the negotiation stage where we know sexist implicit bias can affect the outcome altogether getting rid of salary negotiations and introducing public pay scales is only one piece of the puzzle at sumofus weve put a lot of thought into how to hire for excellence and diversity we often advertise a senior and junior role at the same time to get a diverse pool of candidates this is a deliberate way to attract applicants who may be a good fit for the senior role but who underrate their own experience instead of relying solely on interviews and cvs all candidates take online tests these are marked blind and are likely to be a better predictor of how good someone will be at their job we also have targets to ensure we get a diverse pool of people applying for a job and when we dont meet them we reopen applications large employers such as the bbc have the resources to introduce such policies instead of requiring female employees to petition for what they earn they should focus on the structural changes to pay and progression that eliminate bias and sexism the sooner they start making these changes and stop listening to people such as sir philip hampton the sooner we will close the pay gap the gender pay gap is only one indicator of sexism at work offering flexible working good parental leave regardless of gender and allowing staff to unionise are as important as paying people what they are worth because sumofus campaigns for better employment rights around the world we work hard to be a great employer we still have room to improve but the structural changes weve made have had a real impact getting rid of individual pay negotiations means i no longer have to worry if male colleagues are getting paid more than me to do the same job i know that they arent carys afoko is the communications director at sumofus,2017-08,two year ago opened email job offer contained lot flattering thing great wa much organisation wanted work also contained takeitorleaveit salary offer wa

once there were housewives then there were stayathome mothers and now they too are fast disappearing official figures this week revealed the number of women who have dependent children and go out to work has gone up by a million in two decades in england almost threequarters of mothers with dependent children are now in full or parttime work according to the office for national statistics it is the latest marker of the dramatically shifting landscape of modern motherhood and family life the change has been driven in part by new childcare policies and improved working practices and parental leave but annemarie oleary the editorinchief of the parenting website netmums says the immediate driver is often money it takes two salaries to raise a family these days its not people sitting around and thinking i fancy being a working mum they are not doing it to buy a second home in the south of france or a sports car they are not doing it for any highfalutin reasons they are doing it to pay the bills and keep a roof over their heads women enjoy greater financial independence and equality of opportunity but there are downsides it means we spend less time at home as families says oleary who laments the rise of what she calls tagteam parenting i do dropoff you do pickup ill work monday you work thursday theres lots of juggling going on and less time where whole families spend whole days or weeks together guardian analysis of the ons data reveals much of the rise has been driven by mothers of three and fouryearolds in fulltime work it also shows a quarter of working mothers with dependent children are in professional occupations including teaching medicine and it the rise coincides with the launch of hours of free childcare in with an increase of eight percentage points in women with children in paid work from this month that rose to hours of free childcare for working parents with the expectation that the trend will continue its a picture we already knew about says sam smethers the chief executive of the fawcett society which campaigns for gender equality and womens rights we knew mothers were returning to work in particular if you look at the figures over the last years there has been a big rise in employment among single parents she says childcare is still not adequately subsidised statutory maternity pay is lower than in many comparable countries and there needs to be more workplace flexibility and better support for families many of whom are in poverty despite parents working mothers with very young children still have the lowest employment levels of all parents with dependent children at far behind the of fathers with children of the same age the model of the stayathome wife and the breadwinner dad belongs to the s it leaves women dependent on a man and thats not a good thing if we really want to get the best out of our female labour force we need to do a lot more to support them and to support dads to share the care mothers may be working in ever greater numbers but the chatrooms of parenting websites reveal old anxieties persist the young mother who has had to call in sick on her first shift after maternity leave i feel so bad i just dont know whether they are going to want me to even come back another wrote on mumsnet last week that she had been back at work for seven weeks and felt awful im miserable leaving my baby and going into a job where i feel im not wanted tell me it gets easier another mother who returned to work fulltime when her son was months old wrote in search of moral support i still love my job but am exhausted guiltridden and a bit broken most of the time another wrote am i the only person in the whole wide world thinking what is the point in working after paying out for nursery and after school clubs each month literally half my salary is to pay for a stranger to look after my children slightly more encouragingly another mother wrote i work to keep my career going i went to uni and i do a job i studied and trained to do giving it up after having children seems to be more of a waste and expense than just keeping going through the expensive childcare years justine roberts the ceo of mumsnet says going to work often brings great satisfaction parenthood is glorious and lifechanging but for many meeting the needs of young children can feel like the domestic equivalent of painting the forth bridge if the forth bridge was covered in mashed peas and refused to put its shoes on heading off to a workplace and being paid can affirm mothers sense of themselves as capable valued intelligent adults the downsides she says lie in the cost of childcare the lack of truly familyfriendly roles and the continuing imbalance between mothers and fathers when it comes to domestic labour however she adds that the minority of woman on mumsnet who dont work outside the home feel quite a lot of angst and even anger at the portrayal of stayathome mothers as dimwitted and cloistered equally many of those in paid work want to be around for their children especially in the early years so end up putting their careers in the slow lane fundamentally society needs to change its assumptions so that mothers and fathers are truly free to choose what suits them best thankfully there seems to be a growing body of evidence that millennial dads are much more open to the idea of being very handson with their children right from the start,2017-09,housewife stayathome mother fast disappearing official figure week revealed number woman dependent child go work ha gone million two

the number of mothers with dependent children employed in england has surged by more than a million over the past two decades according to official figures the office for national statistics said there had been a stepchange in the employment rate for working mothers since records began in with almost threequarters of women with dependent children either in fulltime or parttime work encouraging women with young children back into the jobs market has been a priority for labour and conservative governments with the latest initiative an offer of hours free childcare for eligible working families the ons said the figures showed there were million mothers with dependent children in work in up from million in the employment rate rose by percentage points to over the same period although the ons said women with three and fouryearold children were least likely to work fulltime and the most likely to work parttime it found there had been a marked increase in employment among this group mothers were more likely to have a fulltime job when their children went to secondary school at the ons said childcare responsibilities tended to make it more likely that mothers of younger children worked parttime the ons statistician emily glastonbury said the continuing rise in the number of working mothers has been a major feature of the labour market in england in the last two decades reasons for this might include more flexible working practices shared parental leave and changes to government policy on the availability of childcare the ons said single parents were less likely to be in employment than parents in a couple in of single fathers were working compared with of fathers in a couple and of single mothers were in employment as opposed to of mothers in a couple single

a new public information campaign is needed to raise awareness of domestic abuse a major new report will say this week according to its authors publicity modelled on past public health campaigns would raise the profile of the issue and make perpetrators think twice before abusing partners what we are talking about is thinking about messages in the way health have done around smoking and alcohol and other things said eleanor schooling ofsted national director for social carei realise that domestic abuse is of a different order and so the way that message is put across is going to have to be worked through and would be complex because you would have to target difference audience in different ways past campaigns against domestic abuse have included a womens aid initiative working with football clubs and fans last year essex police launched a new video campaign urging abusers to reflect on and change their behaviour while this month saw the release of a new video highlighting coercive behaviour which norfolk police will promote on social media the report due to be published on tuesday by ofsted and three other agencies deals primarily with the impact of domestic abuse on children it will say one of the things we know is that domestic abuse can be easier to stop early on if you realise that something is having a deep effect on your children schooling said one in five children had witnessed some form of domestic abuse its a vast proportion of the population thats six children in a class of for example so this is a longterm thing and if we are going to stop it then we need to catch it early on the review by ofsted the care quality commission her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and the inspectorate of probation examined six local authority areas around england it concludes that while the agencies had overcome many problems associated with the sheer volume of domestic abuse cases far too little is being done in term of prevention we other public services people who are dealing with housing as well as the judiciary need to think about this in a better way schooling said its going to be difficult because a perpetrator might often for example be the owner or tenant of house but i think we need to look at inventive ways that can make sure families can stay where their support networks are fresh thinking was needed she said to focus more on perpetrators than victims and develop research on interventions that are proved to work one idea would be to borrow from the model of the family drug and alcohol courts developing a new approach to child protection cases where one or both parents have drug or alcohol problems i am not saying you could do the same thing with domestic abuse but we could trial some work that might actually galvanise something better for those families early on she said the report quotes one survivor of domestic abuse as saying i called the police on him multiple times and they just kind of patted him on the back and said calm down son and im like hes just thrown me down the goddamn stairs in many cases undue pressure was placed on the mother to protect her children according to the report which criticises how professions have dealt with victims who were subject to coercive or controlling behaviour this included the clearly inappropriate use of written agreements that place responsibility for managing the risk to children with the victim similar to contracts used when social workers and parents agree a set of terms that the parents sign women were variously asked to commit to ending a relationship with an abusive partner to not allow him into the house and to cease all contact we saw no evidence that written agreements were effective given that the focus of written agreements is often not the perpetrator who is the source of the abuse and therefore the risk it is unsurprising that they are ineffective says the report,2017-09,new public information campaign needed raise

women in asx companies hold just of highlevel management roles such as ceo and only of executive team functional roles such as senior positions in strategy it and legal the findings were published on friday by chief executive women the peak organisation representing australian women leaders from the corporate public service academic and notforprofit sectors data on executive leadership teams was collected in august during a census of asx companies it found that asx companies or had no women in their executive leadership team had no women in line roles in their executive leadership team and had no women in functional roles in their executive leadership team line roles were defined as highlevel management positions such as ceo that directly influence key commercial outcomes with those roles usually involving profit and loss accountability functional roles described as roles that perform functions or duties for the company such as it corporate affairs and legal positions women comprise of chief financial officers roles and of group executive chief operating officer roles the report found however there has been improvement over the past nine years the data was compared to a similar government analysis of asx leadership conducted in when of asx companies had no women in their executive leadership teams compared to in only four women held ceo positions in compared to women in chief executive women president kathryn fagg acknowledged the gains had been small but said progress should still be recognised we would have loved to have seen more progress theres no question but there has been movement in the right direction she said the analysis would be conducted at least annually from now on fagg said i think it is important to look at what top companies are doing as theyll be making the changes at the forefront of what happens in out communities the report concluded that achieving gender balance would require leadership research and our experience confirm that the chairman board ceo and leadership team must all be committed to gender balance as a priority otherwise the company is unlikely to make progress the report said this leadership commitment must also translate into visible action and regular communication on why gender balance matters and how everyone benefits eva cox a sociologist and former political adviser who runs a research and policy consultancy said women were judged and paid differently at every level of the workforce you cant say okay we will only fix this for people at the bottom as the top is more influential im not saying people in asx companies will change the world but they are just as entitled to opportunity and fair pay cox said it was not enough to just increase the representation of women in senior executive positions rather women had to be involved in changing the structure of organisations and company goals and strategy she said a lot of the womens movements have swallowed the neoliberal cordial and assumed we could make it on mens terms but we should be trying to get women valued on their terms she said to do this we need to start making the social aspects of businesses and society more valuable than bloody economics women are often more present in human resources positions which are lower paid than executive financial roles because for some reason its considered much harder dealing with money than people we had a badge in the seventies that said women who want equality with men lack ambition they knew we had to change the values and basis on which power was allocated but we seem to

the government has rejected all six proposals to give parliament more equal female representation prepared by the commons women and equalities committee including fines for parties that do not select enough women as candidates the women and equalities committee chair maria miller said the response showed a lack of ambition by the government which she said was content to sit on its hands with an approach which had yielded depressingly slow progress so far the committees report published in january said there was a serious democratic deficit because of the lack of female representation in parliament where men make up of the total mps the committee recommended radical changes to the law before the next election with the uk languishing at th in the world for female representation though up eight places since the june poll however the government has rejected all six of the committees proposals including any legislation to force parties to have a minimum proportion of female parliamentary candidates in general elections with the option to consider fines if targets were not met the committee also recommended the government set a firm target of representation of women in parliament and local government by in the response the government said increasing womens representation was an important aim but did not feel legislation was the answer the government shares the committees view that political parties have primary responsibility for ensuring that women come forward to represent them and are put in positions from which they can win seats the reply said the government does not believe that the best way to achieve this is through legislation and placing an additional regulatory burden on political parties any proposal to sanction parties who did too little to meet diversity targets was also rejected the government does not support quotas set out in legislation and therefore does not agree that sanctions should be introduced the reply said the reply also rejects the committees proposal that parties be required by law to publish their parliamentary candidate diversity data citing concerns about the potential regulatory burden which this would impose particularly on smaller parties miller the former conservative cabinet minister said the response showed the uk was failing to be a world leader on womens representation the governments failure to accept any of the committees recommendations shows a complete lack of action and ambition to bring about real change she said the early general election in june means that government parliament and political parties have a window of opportunity now to make the changes that are needed to ensure a more representative group are elected at the next general election sophie walker the leader of the womens equality party said the response was deeply disappointing by rejecting every one of the women and equalities committees recommendations the government has let all women down and continues to stifle true democracy in which all voices are heard she said walker said there was clear evidence that quotas had been key to increasing the number of women in parliament they are a shortterm solution to fix a longterm imbalance of power and they are a stepping stone towards a political system that sees everyone and is open to all she said we will continue our challenge to the old politics of westminster by mobilising our activists on our clear pathway to getting more women into politics,2017-09,government ha rejected six proposal give parliament equal female representation

a crescendo of nursery rhymes is not what youd expect to hear in an care home for older people but arriving at nightingale house in south london you can hear the children before you can see them isnt it fantastic its the highlight of my week says yearold fay garcia while bouncing baby sasha on her knee its like being reborn garcia never had children but is one of the regulars at the baby and toddler group its been running since january in preparation for the new nursery which opened this week the apples and honey nightingale nursery run by founder judith ishhorowicz is the first of its kind in the uk the concept of intergenerational care began in when a nursery school and a care home were combined in tokyo since then there have been successful schemes across europe australia and the us in singapore the government has committed bn to initiatives to improve ageing in the country including new intergenerational housing developments the uk is still catching up with the idea says stephen burke director of united for all ages for seven years the development agency has worked with a range of organisations including local authorities housing providers care homes and community centres to encourage them to think more broadly about opportunities for combining care interest is growing burke expects the uks first housing development for students and older residents as seen in the netherlands to launch soon and representatives from torbay council in devon will travel to the us this autumn to see examples of best practice nurseries are run near to care homes in cities such as chichester and edinburgh but apples and honey is the first to run a nursery within a care home itself with daily joint activities for the children and residents including exercising reading cooking and eating meals its about bringing people together says burke by getting people talking to each other you break down some of the barriers and challenge some of the stereotypes particularly around ageism dementia and other conditions affecting older people we see this having benefits for all generations ishhorowicz came up with the idea many years ago after bringing children from her first nursery in wimbledon to visit nightingale house each term the new nursery housed in the care homes refurbished maintenance block has places for two to fouryearolds and a number of spots reserved for the children of care home staff everyone ive spoken to loves the idea says ishhorowicz the ofsted registration process went smoothly although there were issues finding insurance we had to explain to them that we werent going to leave the children in the care of the residents or the other way around and they didnt all need to be dbs checked she says ishhorowiczs proposal came when the home was reassessing its own approach to care says simon pedzisi director of care services at nightingale house who had consulted students of medicine occupational therapy and nursing for new ideas our average age on admission is so we have to think in an innovative way about activities says pedzisi care has to be more meaningful deeper and measurable its about social interaction because thats what older people really need when care for older people faces staff shortages funding cuts and estimates that another care home places will be needed by its understandable that innovation is in short supply but pedzisi insists that any extra money needed to support the nursery will be well spent there can be economic benefits for care homes considering sharing their sites says burke including gaining additional rent and sharing administrative ground maintenance and catering costs colocation can also improve recruitment and retention of staff who take advantage of flexible onsite childcare or find satisfaction in the increased variety in their roles the health benefits of alleviating residents social isolation may also lead to savings elsewhere if people are well stimulated and live meaningful lives theyre going to eat well theyre then at less risk of dehydration and falling therefore youll lower the risk of hospital admission says pedzisi increased social interaction is linked to a reduced risk of disease in elderly people which was recently highlighted in channel s old peoples homes for year olds documentary eleven residents of bristolbased st monica trust were found to have improved moods mobility and memory after spending six weeks with children the trust has since committed to adding a fulltime nursery to one of its residential care homes playgrounds at a number of other sites and is developing a new retirement village weve always done intergenerational activities but we wanted evidence so we could roll out wider programmes says david williams the trusts chief executive it has created a buzz and a feeling that we can do things differently its also had an impact on our staff if youre working in an organisation you feel is making a difference you want to be part of that innovation as apples and honey nightingale welcomes its first class of nursery children ishhorowicz is optimistic for the future of intergenerational care theres such a positive feel around this you know its going to work she says its about learning through generations and caring about each other this kind of thing can change society and the community join the social care network for comment

gaby hinsliff provides a searching analysis of how child ab has become a pawn in a bigger political game who will safeguard the victims of our cultural wars september however as well as highlighting the positive contribution of foster carers mention should also be made of kinship carers grandparents uncles and aunts or close family friends it is now little abs grandmother who will be responsible for her care research shows that kinship carers provide a strong family and cultural identity with the child not seeing themselves as in care and they stick with them through troubled times although they often lack the financial practical and personal support they need analysis of census data carried out in showed that just under children in care in england were looked after by kinship carers and a further or living in informal kinship care it is also of note that in the uk just under of young people are placed with kinship carers compared to just under half in spain more than those living in foster or residential care and that there is great variation in usage between english local authorities this evidence clearly suggests the need for kinship care to receive far greater recognition and resources as part of a continuum of care services for children unable to be cared for at home mike stein emeritus professor university of york gaby hinsliff as ever is so perceptive and spot on with one slight exception she says when the report came back positive the judge effectively rubberstamped the decision i do not want readers to have the impression that judges ever rubberstamp decisions they most certainly do not i spent years as a judge now retired dealing with issues surrounding children and parents and always considered all the circumstances evidence reports and the law before reaching a decision all judges do as a matter of course i think gaby accepts this because elsewhere in the piece she says and it is only thanks to that judges published ruling that we now know no decision is ever a foregone conclusion especially where the welfare of a child is concerned david shannon woore shropshire gaby hinsliff provided a wise comment on the socalled muslim fostering row and how biased reporting had created a misleading and mischievous story some surprise then to find that an editorial on the same day the remedy for biased reporting of family courts is more openness september argued that the press should have more access to the family courts and access to personal information about children and families this will not reduce press bias and bile it will though provide easy fodder for salacious and sensational reporting and increased intrusion and exposure for those who are already in difficulty and distressed dr ray jones emeritus professor of social work kingston university and st georges university of london what i find most depressing in the miasma of prejudice and invention surrounding the case of ab is the unquestioning assumption that a fiveyearold child should be a christian or a muslim or anything else she may have parents who subscribe to that religion although in the current case given the family background that seems open to question but the child herself is not old enough to make any such decision as gaby hinsliff says finding a loving family is what matters as for the religion i suggest that a child is old enough to have a religion ascribed when its old enough to take criminal responsibility and thats far too young in this country judith martin winchester hampshire join the debate email

its a sad truth that the care of lookedafter children tends to surface in the national consciousness only as a result of reports that something has seriously gone wrong and so it proved last week with the suggestion that a child of christian origin had been inappropriately placed in the care of a muslim family in the ensuing media furore the judge took the rare decision to publish the case management order which raised serious questions about the accuracy of the narrative pushed by some parts of the press the pressures the foster care system is operating under are rarely accorded the same levels of attention children in the care system are some of the most vulnerable in society six in are there as a result of abuse and neglect threequarters live in foster care placements the quality and stability of those homes are critical in helping children cope with the adversity they have experienced yet there is a chronic shortage of foster carers currently estimated at around which makes finding a stable placement for each child much more difficult foster carers are also facing increasingly difficult conditions which makes it harder for them to provide the support and care these children need carers are often expected to give up work or scale back hours in order to care for children with complex needs yet four in foster carers surveyed by the fostering network say they receive no fee above the allowance to cover the costs of looking after a child and more than half said this allowance did not meet those costs fully for those who received a fee the median was a week but there is evidence that councils have been reducing these fees with little justification or warning provision for respite from providing what is often very complex and emotionally taxing care is very patchy alarmingly foster carers are not protected by whistleblower legislation and are often denied access to due process according to one barrister children can be removed from their care out of the blue official reviews take place in secret and foster carers can be banned from working with children again without recourse while a childs interests must always be put first they are hardly likely to be served by carers too intimidated to speak out about alleged wrongdoing for fear of the consequences the poor conditions many carers face are a product of the nomansland they occupy between quasiparental volunteers and child professionals what was once an informal and voluntary activity has over time developed into a professionalised and regulated system driven by the increasing complexity of the needs of children being taken into care and recognition of the depth of the states responsibility the relationship between a foster carer and a child in their care cannot solely be characterised by the professional the whole point is to provide love attachment and relationship stability yet they have a professional relationship with childrens services they are trained supervised and accountable to the local authority they must follow care plans and have personal development plans they are expected to regularly attend meetings and work with specialist agencies and the birth family one foster carer describes how she often stays up all night waiting for the police to visit when a child absconds from her care the local government association has cautioned against the further professionalisation of foster care arguing that offering better remuneration might attract the wrong person into foster care this feels spurious surely it is the job of vetting and selection procedures to ensure foster carers have the right motivations this fear cannot be allowed to prevent foster carers being paid at a fair level at the other end of the spectrum unions representing foster carers argue that they should become employees this would indeed give foster carers new rights that might prevent for example councils arbitrarily cutting back allowances but there are surely risks that full professionalisation could undermine the very nature of foster care a failure to treat foster carers with the respect they deserve is undoubtedly having an impact on the quality of care provided for societys most vulnerable children there must be a concerted effort to improve the rights and conditions for carers in a way that is consistent with the unique status of foster

the governments childcare record has come under renewed fire this weekend after it emerged that large numbers of children in some of the countrys poorest areas are missing out on a flagship programme introduced by the coalition government to give disadvantaged twoyearolds a better start in life the scheme to provide hours free childcare for of the most disadvantaged twoyearolds was introduced four years ago yet nearly three in children are still not getting the places intended for them according to research by a leading thinktank and the labour mp lucy powell while children are eligible for the scheme the latest statistics from government show that are still missing out a total of children additional analysis by powells office and the social market foundation smf found that disadvantaged twoyearolds in the most deprived areas are twice as likely to miss out on free childcare designed to to help with their development than their counterparts in more affluent areas many of the target parents seem to be unaware of the scheme powell blamed a lack of ministerial focus austerity measures which had reduced local authorities roles and cutbacks in programmes such as sure start which meant that resources were not being put into signposting parents towards the scheme naomi eisenstadt a social policy expert who was the first director of the sure start unit said it takes what we used to call in sure start intensive outreach thats people health visitors or perhaps those who work in the nursery or the childrens centre to understand the demographics of their locality and knock on doors be there walk with the parents with the most disadvantaged families it takes a lot of work but there are good reasons to do it and it needs resources nick clegg who championed the scheme as deputy prime minister also warned that the scheme for twoyearolds was now in danger of withering on the vine and being squeezed out by this great stampede towards providing hours for older children fiercely proud of the initiative clegg also claimed last week that subsequent attempts by him to expand it were blocked by david cameron because the editor of the daily mail would oppose it recalling a meeting in the runup to the coaltions final budget when a few hundred million had become available from the treasury clegg told the observer i remember vividly cameron saying oh we cant possibly do that because paul dacre doesnt like it he thinks twoyearolds should stay at home local authorities with the highest proportions of twoyearolds missing out include many that are marked by high levels of deprivation according to the smf report among them are london boroughs including tower hamlets newham and hillingdon as well as nottingham slough and coventry according to figures compiled by crosschecking with indices of deprivation powell said ministers fixation on delivering on their election bungs to betteroff parents means theyve taken their eye off the ball when it comes to the disadvantaged twoyearold offer this flagship policy will be ruined if it is not given more priority particularly in areas where so few toddlers are benefitting from the scheme the evidence is now clear that this quality early education for disadvantaged twoyearolds can be lifechanging given this it is scandalous that so little is being done to ensure as many children as possible benefit from it the hours scheme launched last friday promises that amount of free childcare for working parents of three and fouryearolds however three quarters of nurseries and childcare providers say that the money offered by the government to fund its election pledge will not cover costs the hours provision was born twoandahalf years ago amid what clegg described as a dutch auction between the tories and labour who had made similar promises i remember david cameron saying i want to shoot labours fox clegg said im afraid it is a very depressing saga once again of shortterm political gimmickry consuming huge amounts of public resources not being properly delivered and actually not helping children that are most in need of help the minister of state for children and families robert goodwill said every child should receive the same highquality care and support regardless of their background or where they live we are spending over bn on hours of free childcare for disadvantaged twoyearolds over five years we know that the takeup of this offer is rising with of disadvantaged twoyearolds accessing a place an increase of percentage points since our independent evaluation of pilot areas where nurseries were delivering the hours offer showed that it did not have any significant adverse effects on the twoyearold offer,2017-09,government childcare record ha come renewed fire weekend emerged

the nature of fatherhood is changing in the past fathers bore the burden as a familys sole breadwinner nowadays just as many mothers want to to pursue their careers many fathers want to be actively involved in raising children gennaro folino a retail design manager is one such dad he took time off work to support his wife when she wanted to return to work and became the main carer for his baby son i iost my father a couple of years ago i didnt get to see him that much when we were growing up because he was working long hours in a factory and i didnt want to miss out on time with my son julian folino was lucky because his employer stockland provides parental leave benefits which he was able to take knowing that it would not negatively impact his career but not all australian fathers have the same opportunity data from the workplace gender equality agency shows that only about half of nonpublic sector organisations with more than employers offer paid primary carers leave however unsurprisingly the data also shows a predictable pattern of primary carers leave being taken overwhelmingly by women when primary carers leave is available to men during the first year of a childs life it creates the opportunity for men to take up the fulltime caring role when their partner is ready to return to work a true winwin but even when it is offered many employers tell us that men are often reluctant to take up their parental leave entitlements it is a similar situation with flexible working arrangements the other crucial element in encouraging fathers to take on caring responsibilities our data shows almost twothirds of nonpublic sector organisations with more than employers had either a flexible working policy or strategy in place yet far fewer men than women are accessing flexible work so why is it that more men are not taking parental leave and working flexibly one of the reasons is gender bias in the workplace the impact of workplace gender bias on women is severe however it can also affect men particularly fathers a report by the australian human rights commission for instance found that of fathers and partners reported experiencing discrimination related to parental leave and return to work men are also more likely to have their requests for flexible work rejected and may be considered less committed to their job the example of andrew jamieson debunks this notion before starting work at notfor profit aged care provider benetas jamieson had deeplyheld assumptions about the role of men i was fulltime the main breadwinner and left the majority of caring responsibilities to my wife who is a teacher i think there was a belief that there was a tradeoff between flexibility and career and you couldnt have both jamieson purchased leave to have an additional two weeks leave each year which he uses to share caring responsibilities for his son he now thinks differently about being a father husband and working professional a career can coexist with flexible working and im hoping this will also allow my wife to develop her career further without many of the impediments that existed previously achieving gender equality in the workplace requires more employers to introduce parental leave and flexibility policies that encourage takeup by men but changing mindsets and workplace cultures is equally important these two stories show how it can be done for the benefit of employers and employees alike stocklands parental leave scheme for example has seen a higher returntowork rate and increased loyalty from employees gender equality is about women and men working together to create more equal opportunities and genuine choice for everyone this fathers day lets talk about ways to make it easier for dads to share the caring responsibilities for their children it will help us all in the long run libby lyons is the director of the workplace gender equality agency,2017-09,nature fatherhood changing past father bore burden

childcare costs have risen up to seven times faster than wages according to tuc research average costs in england for parents with a oneyearold rose between and and single parents have been hit hardest spending more than of their wages on childcare while the government subsidises to hours of childcare for three and fouryearolds most parents with oneyearolds get no help in the meantime some nurseries and childminders are struggling or closing because while their workload and obligations have increased state funding is inadequate reading this i realised that ive been relatively lucky with childcare although i was a single mum for years i could mainly work from home and childcare became akin to an ongoing game of logistical twister if i do this i can just about do that and if i put my child there i can just about make it to there a patchwork of nurseries babysitters help from other parents afterschool clubs and sometimes in emergencies taking children along to assignments jimmy mcgovern was particularly good humoured about the flying lego bricks sometimes it was all a twisterstretch too far and i ended up in a disorganised undignified heap but i got through later i had huge amounts of help from grandparents the uks notsosecret army of childcarers like i say lucky as the research suggests other people arent so fortunate indeed away from the top tier of childcare livein nannies upmarket nurseries for too many people the first questions always have to be what can we afford and whats flexible flexible usually meaning can you drop the kids off early enough so that you dont get a reputation for being late at work and can you pick them up late enough so that you dont get a reputation for sneaking off early in this context other important questions who can you trust is the child happy are you happy could start to seem almost frivolous when your childs welfare ultimately depends on you keeping your job childcare goes from being a choice to being a basic utility as indispensable as the water from your taps and the electricity that powers your lights its at this level that people are hardest hit by substandard state provisions and of these people it would seem that women are the hardest hit of all in particular very low earners and single mothers so whats new right indeed its amazing that for so many women childcare and childcare costs remain the single biggest thing they have to sort out before theyre even allowed to work while there will always be exceptions increasingly so as families base decisions on who is the highest earner it still seems that women bear the brunt both of the aforementioned issues of childcare and of not having childcare giving up jobs cutting back hours stalling careers although women are on the childcare frontline ultimately its the family as a whole that pays the multifaceted cost financial logistical and emotional thats if the cost can be borne at all part of the problem seems to be this absurd antiquated view of childcare as a kind of lifestyle whim an indulgence resulting in a government that seems bewildered by criticisms of its inadequate underfunded system why are so many younger children not being funded why are childcare professionals pressured to such a degree that they must pass on additional costs to parents when will it be acknowledged that for many families wages are intolerably out

the cost of childcare for young children in england has risen up to seven times faster than wages since analysis shows tuc research published on friday shows that childcare costs for parents with a oneyearold have soared by almost half over a period when their wages have fallen after adjusting for inflation albeit rising by in cash terms the difference in the rate of increase was greatest in london where childcare costs rose times faster than pay between and and the east midlands where they rose seven times quicker unlike parents with older children who have not started school most of the working parents with oneyearolds do not get any state help meaning the costs are eating into their family budgets the union says the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said the cost of childcare is spiralling but wages arent keeping pace parents are spending more and more of their salaries on childcare and the picture is even worse for single parents nearly a million working parents with oneyearold kids have eyewatering childcare bills there is a real gap in childcare support for oneyearolds until government assistance kicks in at age two parents need subsidised affordable childcare from as soon as maternity leave finishes to enable them to continue working and so mums dont continue to have to make that choice between having a family and a career the union found that a single parent working fulltime with a oneyearold in nursery for hours a week spent more than a fifth of their wages on childcare last year where one parent was working fulltime and the other parttime the figure was and for two parents working fulltime it was a single parent working fulltime with a oneyearold child in nursery for hours a week spent twofifths of their salary on childcare last year in each case the percentage was up on the equivalent figure the wage figures were drawn from the labour force survey published by the office for national statistics ons average wages have slumped further in real terms this year with the latest ons report published on wednesday showing that adjusted for inflation they are at the same level as they were in february the tuc has long been urging the government to address the pay squeeze including by scrapping the public sector pay cap to coincide with the publication of the figures showing the relative rise in childcare costs it is demanding that the government also does more to increase affordability of nursery places it proposes universal free childcare from the end of maternity leave more funding to enable local authorities to provide care and a greater role for employers either through direct subsidy to employees or the provision of onsite creches the childcare cost figures provided by the family and childcare trust fct showed that they rose the most in the west midlands followed by the east midlands and the northeast the smallest increase was in the east of england which saw childcare costs rise times faster than wages since the fct chief executive ellen broom said childcare was as vital as the rails and roads to making our country run she added for too many parents however high childcare costs mean that it does not pay to work lowincome families claiming universal credit typically take home just per hour after childcare costs have been paid and some get even less than this we must make sure every parent is better off working after childcare costs purnima tanuku chief executive of the national day nurseries association ndna blamed the increase in costs on the governments policy to extend free childcare for three and fouryearolds to hours without adequate investment she said nurseries are left with a shortfall which can only be passed on to parents in the form of higher fees for paidfor hours the children and families minister robert goodwill said the government was providing taxfree childcare to about million households helping families access affordable childcare is at the heart of this

the number of children in care in england has gone up for the ninth successive year and stood at at the end of march according to figures published last week there are many reasons to feel sad and angry about this with local authority leaders blaming rising poverty levels and singling out universal credit delays as one reason why vulnerable families are finding life increasingly difficult but we should not assume that being taken into care means that these childrens lives are blighted for ever we are constantly bombarded by stories and statistics that reinforce a widespread negative impression of children growing up in care in england children in care are five times more likely to be cautioned or convicted of an offence than children in the general population asserted a prison reform trust report earlier this year while homeless charity shelter has found that between a quarter and a third of all people sleeping on the streets have spent time as children being looked after by local authorities half of children in care agree with the statement people think that it is childrens fault that they are in care according to a recent report from become the charity for children in care and care leavers so great was the stigma associated with being in care that following the children act professionals and others were encouraged to refer to lookedafter children instead such negative images have an effect on kids in care kids such as me who have never thought that they would go to prison and have always wanted to achieve highly within education some of the children in local authority care have undoubtedly experienced difficulties and many will experience more but each one of them also has enormous potential it often feels as though the media and by extension the public are only interested in the systems failures and not in young people such as me who are thriving with futures that look bright rather than focusing on the care systems flaws it is important to appreciate what a vital resource it is i believe the problems of people who have grown up in care stem predominantly from their experiences before they entered the system and from the damage done early on that cannot easily or sometimes ever be reversed in particular we should recognise the progress of recent years before the children leaving care act of care leavers frequently received inadequate support as this was provided at local authorities discretion many young people were thrust out of the care system without financial support or emotional guidance the act forced authorities to provide care leavers with support until the age of as an yearold care leaver today this change has ensured that i continue to excel within education and feel safe and secure in the knowledge that there are people i can turn to for advice the act has allowed me to continue to live at home with my loving foster parents rather than being forced to live independently before i am ready the support that the uk provides for care leavers can be appreciated further when it is compared to the support that other countries provide in israel there was no specific foster care law until while a study by the university of york discovered that albanian children are expected to become completely selfsufficient from the age of another positive development in the uk is the requirement that all local authorities have a children in care council meaning they must actively listen to the voices of children and young people in care and give those who are most affected by decisions a say in decisionmaking when i chaired the one in york i was involved in the recruitment and training of key professionals and developed campaigns to combat the stigma faced by children growing up in care such councils serve to remind professionals of their purpose of course the uk does not have a perfect care system there is vast room for improvement however those of us who have grown up in care and had good experiences would like those experiences to be represented alongside less positive portrayals so we no longer feel invisible above all its worth reflecting on how far we have moved on from the care system of the past the care system is a work in progress and more changes need to be made for example extending the age of support for care leavers to and ensuring that kinship care is promoted and kinship carers are entitled to the same support as foster carers the care system needs to become more standardised to ensure all children and young people in care can expect the same treatment regardless of their local authority rather than the current acceptance that different levels of service are offered this could be achieved if the government were to create clear primary legislation that outlines the key principles that all local authorities must adhere to as was the case with the children leaving care act but i believe that progress is being made in the uk and also internationally we mustnt believe that it is beyond our reach to build a care system that can help make up for the disadvantage faced by young people who for whatever reason are unable to live with

social services in rotherham are looking for a new adoptive home for four sisters because their foster mother feels she is too old to look after them a care plan approved by a judge has ruled that the girls all under cannot be separated their yearold foster mother who has been kept anonymous to protect the identity of the children said the girls needed a home for at least the next years and that she and her husband were unable to provide that theyre lovely she told the guardian im not going to say theyre easy work no children are i dont know anybody who finds parenting easy but considering what theyve gone through theyre lovely they do ask when theyre going to get a new mummy and daddy and we keep saying that theyre looking i just hope there is someone out there who will take on four little girls because they would have a lovely readymade family rotherham council said finding people who were willing to adopt groups of siblings was particularly hard there are only groups of four or more siblings needing adoption nationwide two of which are in rotherham the local authority offers a package of support for anyone willing to adopt a larger group of siblings including financial help to buy a bigger car and other items for the home the girls were brought into care because of neglect and their foster mother said the eldest had been playing the role of a mother to her sisters when they first arrived with the family the eldest was like a little mum and she isnt now she knows that she can go off and do her own thing on her own if she wants she doesnt have to worry about the others she said they love each other and theyve always been together it would be devastating for these children to be split up the foster mother and her husband have seven children six of whom they have adopted and three of whom were siblings they have fostered more than children over the past years they have grandchildren and say they will continue to foster for another couple of years gordon watson the deputy leader of rotherham council and the cabinet member for children and young peoples services said having children was a gift and something to be treasured but that some were not lucky enough to be born into families where they are put first in this way and for some children keeping bonds they have already developed with their siblings can make all the difference in order for them to be able to thrive he said this group of four young girls have a very close sibling bond and it would no doubt cause them further grief if they were to be split up in order to find them permanent

some children a day were taken into care last year and the total number of children in care is now at a new high according to the latest statistics and care numbers are rising at the fastest rate for five years financially this is unsustainable but in human terms too it cant carry on because where does it leave the thousands of traumatised and grieving mothers and their broken families who must stumble on with no support and no hope leah was when we met in her solicitors office a care leaver herself this young mother had just lost her second son to adoption aged nine months he was meeting all his developmental milestones and she loved him deeply her first baby had been removed earlier at just four months old leah was so traumatised she could barely speak but i already knew the background in two scathing judgments the senior family judge who removed her second son set out just how thoroughly this young woman had been failed by the state throughout her own childhood and beyond sexually abused by her stepfather and stepbrothers when she was finally taken into care as a teenager she had had changes of foster home in months she received no support from childrens services to cope with the transition to adult life leah was effectively abandoned unsurprisingly when she had her first baby she couldnt look after him well enough he was forcibly removed and soon adopted psychologists are clear that specialist therapy can offer mothers like leah a genuine chance to care for their children well enough to keep them a realistic cost would be one session a week for a year at an average of each time but women often dont get the right help before they become pregnant and they dont get it after a baby is removed either with the baby rescued the child protection concerns melt away exactly at this point young women have told me over and over social services just drop you i met leah two and a half years ago despite repeated calls for specialist therapeutic support from the judiciary family rights groups and women themselves its clear that nothing much has changed there is a vast human cost to this failure to support to vulnerable mothers according to recent research from lancaster universitys longitudinal study into recurrent care proceedings the number of women going to court to fight for their children has doubled in seven years from nearly in to nearly in yet there is still no statutory entitlement to trauma support or specialist ongoing therapy for women like leah last month leahs judge published a judgement in which he described yet another truly wretched public law case reading the judgement induces a miserable sense of deja vu in it stephen wildblood qc echoes his own words in leahs judgement as he again deplores the lack of help for another young mother with a background in which she has experienced extreme abuse and deprivation whom i am told by everyone involved in this case has not been offered therapeutic support despite the authorities knowing full well for the last three years that this second young mother had difficulties and therefore plenty of time to offer her the kind of specialist therapy that would have given her a fighting chance to keep at least her second baby nobody made that call and so another young woman has had trauma heaped upon trauma any parent understands that she will never recover lack of access to mental health services creates a deep sense of injustice for mothers in this situation notes lancaster universitys social work professor karen broadhurst at around adoptions a year more children are adopted in this country than in any other eu nation so why are we still failing to step in early consistently and with commitment to help young women in urgent need of support its certainly isnt that we cant afford itcare cases cost a small fortune to take through court and foster placements are vastly expensive the annual cost of care is put at between and though ostensibly cheaper because of being a oneoff adoption costs are rising as it is increasingly understood that adoptive families need longterm professional support to cope in short untold millions are spent on rescuing children but we wont fork out considerably less to help birth mothers whose lives have been shattered though the groundbreaking pause programme offers intensive support to women who have had children removed it only operates in a few areas of the country and is dependent on individual local authorities choosing to fund it the fact that pause must be specially commissioned and that the few other similar services must scrabble desperately for funds perfectly highlights the fact that supporting such women is seen as optional not fundamental mental health care for a trauma survivor what seems to be forgotten is that leah and other women like her usually are that vulnerable child everyone insists they are so concerned about but unfortunately now the wrong side of and therefore unrescueworthy the european court of human rights affirmed last year that the state has positive obligations to keep families together but our system illogically splits parents welfare from childrens welfare under the lazy mantra the childs welfare is paramount you cannot have one without the other the result of this blinkered focus is that their mothers are brutally written off some women kill themselves when their children are removed for those who physically survive the retraumatising effects of losing child after child destroys a persons psyche yet we turn away from the human ruins our system has created and work hard to ignore the damage that travels down the generations we cant afford to do otherwise or wed see that the destruction of these women is due to our failure to address the fallout of the poverty social alienation and violence that degraded their own lives,2017-10,child day taken care last year total number child care new high according latest statistic care number

welfare reforms reductions in family support services such as sure start and rising poverty levels are fuelling record numbers of children being taken into care local authority leaders have said the association of directors of childrens services adcs said austerity policies and an increasingly fragmented approach to public services were taking a toll on communities and punishing the most economically fragile households the unintended consequence of the governments austerity programme has been to drive up demand for child protection services as more and more families find themselves at the point of crisis with little or no early help available it said in a report the adcs president alison michalska said long delays for universal credit payments alongside welfare policies such as the twochild limit and housing benefit cuts were causing difficulties for poorer families struggling to pay for food and rent the latest official statistics show children were in care in england at the end of march up on the previous year and the ninth successive year that this number has increased between and the number of children assessed by social workers as as being in need rose by the number of children subject to a child protection plan increased by and numbers in care were up michalska who is the director of children and adult services at nottingham city council said a growing number of families faced a bleak reality she said more support was needed including more flexibility in the benefits regime to prevent families under the stress of poverty from spiralling into crisis we are i think i hope beginning to see a move away from some aspects of austerity which are welcome but families living in deprived areas will continue to suffer unless some flexibility can be introduced to the currently inflexible benefits regime for example in some local areas in which universal credit has been rolled out the wait for benefits is in some cases exceeding six weeks which means that families are struggling to pay for basic essentials such as food and rent the rigidity of the benefits system also compounds the impact of insecure erratic and unstable employment there is a real need for government to consider how the benefit system can reflect and deal with the issues that affect families today speaking at the national children and adult services conference in bournemouth she said that financial pressures in childrens services the nhs police and education alongside reforms in health education and social care were all taking their toll on our communities she added providing help and support to children and families early is the only way to reduce demand for highend statutory services and health and social care in the long run not doing so is a false economy and fundamentally is not in children and young peoples best interests an adcs report a country that works for all children said children living in the poorest areas of the country were times more likely to be put on to a child protection plan or be subject to care proceedings than youngsters in wealthier areas local authorities had suffered an average cuts in funding since and a bn funding gap between demand for childrens services and available resources has emerged it said an estimated youth centres closed between and while childrens centres have shut since the report added the symptoms of poverty are driving increased demand for childrens services and although councils continue to do their best to support vulnerable families and children the lack of sustainable funding must be addressed as a matter of urgency robert goodwill minister for children and families said councils will receive more than bn for local services including childrens social care up to this is part of a historic fouryear settlement which means councils can plan ahead with certainty we have invested m through our childrens social care innovation programme providing councils and the voluntary and

male speakers dominated panel events at fringe meetings at the conservative partys conference in manchester taking up more than twothirds of the speaking slots an analysis by the guardian found that of the more than panel seats available just were filled by women while of the named speakers on the fringe conference programme were women the representation at this weeks tory conference compares unfavourably with that at the labour party conference a week earlier of the available panel seats at labour fringe events were filled by women of the named speakers were women there were fringe events

of speakers on fringe panels were women at the conservative conference in suggesting little has changed in two years this compared with equivalent labour conference events where of speakers were women

carers who voluntarily look after younger relatives to stop them being taken into care are being denied thousands of pounds in welfare entitlements as a result of the twochild benefit cap despite government promises to exempt them campaigners have called on ministers to change rules whereby kinship carers who act as guardians for at least two children are refused child tax credits and maternity grants when they decide to have a child of their own ministers promised kinship carers a year ago they would not be subject to the twochild policy after a defeat over the issue in the house of lords however it has emerged that the exemption only applies to carers who have birth children first and then become guardian to a third child not the other way around although in such cases the third child is the carers first birth child officials have blocked child tax credit payments worth a year because the claimant is considered to have breached the twochild limit that came into force in april melanie onn labour mp for great grimsby said it was unjust that kinship carers who had made great personal sacrifices to care for relatives and saved the state hundreds of thousands of pounds in fostering costs were refused financial support its unfair for people who have given up large parts of their life to take care of their close family they do that with commitment and love and without regret to see them having children of their own and then having state support denied seems so incredibly unfair onn has raised the case of a constituent alyssa vessey of grimsby who was when she gave up college to formally care for her three younger siblings following the sudden death of their mother four years ago vessey was told that her application for child tax credits and a sure start maternity grant before the birth of her baby this summer was refused because she had fallen foul of the twochild rule she appealed twice but was turned down both times her son is now three months old she told the guardian its unfair they are saying if you take on children we wont give you any money if you have a family of your own people who save the government thousands by caring for children should get money and support when they have a family of their own the department for work and pensions stood by the decision to deny child tax credits to carers like vessey saying it ensured fairness between claimants and taxpayers who support themselves solely through work a spokesman said we know some parents and carers are not in the position where their decision rests solely on whether they can afford a third child and thats why we have many exemptions in place we continue to pay child benefit for all children in a household the twochild limit was introduced by the former work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith two years ago on the grounds that it would force parents to take responsibility for their choices and teach them that children cost money since april as a result of the policy families that have a third or subsequent child will no longer be able to claim child tax credits for this child or any future children tax credits are intended to help with the costs of bringing up a child the government expects to save more than bn annually by through the twochild cap although charities estimate it will trigger a rise in child poverty over the same period as affected families stand to lose nearly a year ministers who had previously lauded kinship carers as unsung heroes eventually agreed to exempt them from the twochild cap last year after a defeat in the lords during the passage of the welfare reform and work bill opposition peers had argued that failure to exempt would deter potential carers from coming forward it has emerged that the government was warned about the anomaly affecting carers in vesseys situation by the kinship care alliance last november in a formal consultation response but this appears to have been ignored by officials cathy ashley chief executive of the family rights group charity said it is particularly pernicious that this anomaly impacts on those who have gone the extra mile in caring for their younger siblings often from a very young age we did bring this to the attention of the government before the policy was introduced however we trust that its implementation is oversight and is urgently corrected by ministers children move into kinship care for a variety of reasons including parental death neglect or abuse parental illness addiction and imprisonment an estimated children in the uk are raised by kinship carers saving the taxpayer billions of pounds alyssa vessey teenage carer when her mother died suddenly four years ago alyssa vessey was a grimsby teenager training to become a hairdresser just days later she was asked whether she would be prepared to look after her three younger siblings become in effect their replacement mother she agreed willingly we went to social services and my family said to me wed understand if you didnt want to take them on but my brother and sisters would have gone into care if i didnt step up and bring them up theyd be in the care system becoming a kinship carer aged was she says the hardest thing shed ever done i had to do everything waking them up in the morning and making sure they got breakfast making sure they got to school doing the tea when they got back and making sure they did their homework i was there for every parents evening every gcse meeting i did everything to make sure the children do well in life vessey says she had to give up her social life and she lost friends as a result money was always tight as she adjusted to her new role she got a job at primark to help make ends meet and put a bit put aside to take her siblings to lincoln on a rare holiday she is proud that this year the eldest of her three siblings keeley went to university the first in their family to do so i was determined that they had to make my mum proud get the best grades they can my mum always said she wanted the best for us all to take every opportunity this summer vessey and her partner adam celebrated the birth of their own child joey they have had to cut back hard after being informed that joey did not qualify for tax credits or a sure start maternity grant because they had breached the twochild limit she said i think the twochild rule will put some potential carers off because not a lot of people out there know that when they take on children with guardianship they are not going to get any money for their own children its going to be a lot tighter for them but nobody knows about that,2017-10,carers voluntarily look younger relative stop taken care denied thousand pound welfare entitlement result twochild benefit cap despite

jeremy corbyn is leading a crossparty effort to force ministers to publish details of the impact of their policies broken down by gender race age disability class and region after analysis showed women continue to bear the brunt of austerity the labour leader has signed a letter with other mps including members of his own party the liberal democrats snp and greens calling for an immediate equality assessment of all government policies the letter to the education secretary justine greening whose brief covers equalities accuses the government of failing in its duty to sufficiently consider the impact of its actions on all groups in society labour said its analysis showed that men received more spending in philip hammonds autumn budget a financial model developed by yvette cooper the senior labour backbencher and house of commons library statisticians found that of savings to the treasury from tax and benefit changes since had come from women labour said the latest

shadow equalities secretary jo swinson the deputy lib dem leader angela crawley the snp spokeswoman on equalities and caroline lucas the coleader of the greens said if the government continues in this manner there can be no public confidence that the public sector equality duty is being fulfilled we are calling on the government to undertake and publish a comprehensive cumulative equality impact assessment of all government policies this assessment must include analysis of the impact of all its policies in relation to gender race age disability class and region we urge the adoption of this proposal as a matter of urgency so the government can assess the overall impact of its policies on the population as a whole and specific groups sharing protected characteristics labour is committed to auditing every budget for gender impact and promoting gender equality at the heart of economic policymaking butler said the budget had not once mentioned women and was more of the same from the chancellor with women and our diverse communities again being forced to bear the brunt of this failed tory economic project she said despite theresa may herself warning in that cuts would disproportionately impact on those with protected characteristics her government continues to pursue an economic agenda based on discrimination and inequality which has hit women the hardest a spokesman for the government said the treasury considered the equality impacts of individual policies on those with protected characteristics including gender race and disability in line with its legal obligations and what it said was its strong commitment to equality we are fully committed to equality and carefully consider how those with protected characteristics are impacted by government policy he said about million more women are in work since and the fulltime gender pay gap is at a record low we publish comprehensive distributional analysis at every budget which shows that the state continues to be highly redistributive the treasury said analysis published by others tended to exclude spending on public services that directly benefited households such as the nhs and could assume that all households fully take up all benefits to which they are entitled and exclude tax measures for which there was not sufficient data to attribute the impact to individual households it said

the children and family court advisory and support services new guidance on parental alienation parents at war could risk losing children november is worrying cafcass justifies its groundbreaking approach by a significant rise in alienation cases with of children of divorcing parents being turned against their nonresident parents a process that can profoundly damage the child parental alienation is undeniably damaging especially in its more extreme form nevertheless as early as american researchers were warning that too often in divorce situations all children resisting contact were being labelled alienated and their parents as abusive and alienating parents more recent research fortin hunt and scanlon taking a longer view of contact the perspectives of young adults who experienced parental separation in their youth suggests that it is a mistake to assume that a childs reluctance to have contact with the nonresident parent is simply due to brainwashing by the resident parent our evidence suggests that even relatively young children may have very clear reasons of their own for resistance to contact cafcasss plan to help abusive parents to change their behaviour with the help of intense therapy sounds kafkaesque especially with the ultimate sanction of care proceedings to remove the child hopefully it is considering carefully the extreme dangers of mistakenly diagnosing parental alienation after all failure to establish the real reason for a childs resistance to contact may lead to abuse andor domestic violence being overlooked and worse to the child being removed from a victimised mother seeking only to protect her child jane fortin emeritus professor of law sussex university speaking as someone who was alienated from a parent while growing up and therefore didnt see them for most of my teenage years i read with horror the groundbreaking plans by cafcass to potentially force children to live with the parent they are alienated from and even to cut off contact with the alienating parent parental alienation is damaging to children and to the adults they become but there is absolutely nothing about this proposal that would have helped in my situation and a great deal that would have made it worse parental alienation is rarely black and white most parents who discourage contact with the nonresident parent are motivated by good intentions however misguided the child comes to believe the picture they paint of that parent this means that forcing the child to live with the alienated parent will be extremely frightening for the child the use of the child as a pawn of the state to punish the alienating parent and the threat of cessation of contact with them simply replicates and deepens the coercive abuse of power the child is already experiencing at the hands of their parents either way the child still risks loss of a parental relationship it would be a very different matter if this intervention is trying to find out the authentic views of the child but there is little in this article to suggest this is the plan we need to stop looking to coercive interventions as a tool to fix complex problems in family relationships why for example is the solution to the alienating parent to force them into therapy and what ethical therapist would undertake therapy under duress an alternative strategy which was never offered to me would be to offer longterm advocacy support to the child and therapy if needed to help them pick their way through the mess their parents have created and determine for themselves what they want it is also worth noting that in the absence of legal aid for private law family litigation both parents and the child risk loss of at least one of the most important of lifes relationships without legal representation we would not tolerate this for public law care proceedings even though the outcome may be the same im disappointed that the guardian seems to have presented

have been recognised by the council being crowned overall winner of this years guardian public service awards as well as winning the care category david brindle the guardians public services editor and cochair of the judging panel says hertfordshire has truly broken the mould by going back to the drawing board and thinking from first principles about how to work effectively with families under pressure it is delivering outstanding results its true that the new approach was helped with a significant grant from government but if you dont ask you dont get hertfordshire asked and now not just the council but other public agencies too are reaping big savings and above all children and families are healthier and happier hertfordshires ambition was to keep children safely in their own home taking services directly to the home rather than referring family members to outside services as sue williams director of family safeguarding at the council points out a parent with a heroin addiction is unlikely to make an appointment with a service two bus rides away but is much more likely to talk to a professional who visits their home the new service was born out of a commitment to tackle what williams calls the toxic trio of domestic abuse substance misuse and parental mental health problems the factors that put children at risk of significant harm it also wanted to introduce a less adversarial way of working with families if you call on a parent because youve had a concern expressed about the care of their children then they have a vested interest in lying to you so you dont take their children away says williams this confrontational relationship contributes to a high turnover of staff in childrens social care social workers feel helpless to resolve the problems of the children and families they are trying to support instead of monitoring parents compliance with protection plans the new system empowers social workers to give parents the opportunity to think about what they want to change in their lives it also instils extra confidence in parents that they will be able to meet their childrens needs in the initiatives first year the time children spent in the care system was cut by and with less reliance on expensive agency social workers the authority saved about m staff sickness rates have dropped and turnover has fallen dramatically only of vacancies are unfilled but the successes extend beyond the council the service has also had an impact on domestic abuse the biggest single crime in hertfordshire by the end of its first months there was a reduction in repeat police callouts to domestic abuse incidents there has also been a reduction in emergency hospital admissions for adults and a improvement in pupils attendance at school at the same time social workers were trained in motivational interviewing a technique that involves listening to parents sympathetically and working with them to develop a plan of how they would like to change we start off with the parents asking them to tell us about their lives and their experience we acknowledge the difficult lives and upbringing theyve had it encourages them to open up we talk to them about the services that we could offer to try and help them with their really difficult challenges says williams the project which started twoandahalf years ago is now funded by the council and its partners but other local authorities have shown interest and with the help of m of government funding four other councils luton borough council peterborough city council bracknell forest council and west berkshire council are now testing the hertfordshire model so what of the people who really matter in all this the families an independent evaluation obtained moving testimonies from parents about the effect of the intervention one man who participated in the domestic abuse prevention programme said that he was calmer and as a result his children were happier and a woman who was struggling with

i work at asha a specialist voluntary organisation that provides refuge spaces to women from black and minority ethnic communities in three refuges in south london two of our refuges are for women and children one is for young women but we dont see ourselves surviving if government plans to stop women fleeing abusive partners from using housing benefit to pay for accommodation in refuges goes ahead we are six members of staff three of which are parttime in the past we have offered inhouse counselling and dance and movement therapy and had a childrens worker now we signpost women to dwindling services some of which are inappropriate or unable to provide the support needed or have such a backlog that women can be waiting the majority of their sixmonth stay for an initial assessment foodbank vouchers are standard issue for women arriving at our office in a previous round of cuts many services for bame women lost their funding from local authorities they are always the first to go three years ago we had a funding cut of just over for a woman arriving at asha marks a frightening uncertain time in her life she has already gone through so much abuse she might also have experienced isolation and estrangement from family friends ongoing child contact issues insecure immigration status physical and mental health needs traumatised children debt and destitution and more we support her recovery and her journey towards her new life we help her access counselling support her while she recalls that abuse for police social workers and lawyers embrace her when she is overwhelmed and share in her relief when a perpetrator is convicted or when she receives news from the home office that she can stay the uk we make a housing application so she can finally move to a safe and secure home in the past women who lived at asha refuges had access to social housing today when leaving a refuge women are moved on to insecure unsafe private accommodation thats expensive and frequently unmanageable universal credit has exacerbated the problem this has necessitated the creation of direct action groups such as sisters uncut which campaign against cuts to services and welfare for women who have been affected by violence young women under the age of are particularly at risk a yearold who moves on from our refuge is entitled to a room in a shared house but in london there is a dearth of such property some local authorities simply say they cannot house such women we encourage residents to source their own moveon accommodation but landlords either want more money than the amount covered by housing benefit or they are refusing housing benefit claimants in part because of delays since the introduction of universal credit we have two women experiencing such difficulties they work in lowpaid jobs with insecure hours they have been subjected to eviction threats from landlords or harassment by other tenants one woman said she was offered a room to live in at cheap rent but was expected to accept a landlords predatory behaviour she didnt and became homeless again daily acts of compassion and solidarity do happen pregnant women are accompanied to scans by other women new arrivals understandably fearful and untrusting are befriended by others the death of a terminally ill resident left her sisters in her refuge distraught women are there for one another when they are at their most alone and bereft at each funding round we have to justify the need for specialist services at a time when the government claims to be treating forced marriage and female genital mutilation as a high priority specialist services for bame women like ours are having to justify the need to exist at all the proposal to hand a ringfenced grant to councils to spend on shortterm supported housing for the different people who may need it from exoffenders to rough sleepers as well as women and children fleeing domestic violence is akin to throwing essential support services into a gladiatorial arena and watching them scramble for the rope refuges will close specialist refuges will be most vulnerable and women will return to their abusers we have retreated to a dickensian

more than vulnerable women and children fleeing domestic abuse will be unable to access a refuge if government plans to remove guaranteed funding for the service go ahead an emergency survey has found in a survey of refuge services in england by womens aid said they would have to close for good if they lost the funding while a further said they would be forced to reduce the number of bed spaces available this would result in around more women and more children trying to escape domestic violence and psychological torture being turned away from refuges which can help them rebuild their lives and regain independence the charity said the survey was conducted urgently after the government published plans to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system which would prevent women paying for their place with housing benefit on average housing benefit makes up of refuge funding and as there is no obligation on local authorities to fund refuges is the last remaining guaranteed source of income the predicted losses highlighted in the findings come at a time when demand for refuges outstrips supply on one day this year women and children were turned away from a refuge while of referrals to refuges in were declined katie ghose chief executive of womens aid said demand for refuges already far outstrips supply and the proposed funding model could be the breaking point refuges will be faced with the awful reality of either turning more women and children away or closing their doors forever on average two women a week are killed by their partner or expartner in england and wales a refuge is not just a bed for a night it is a lifeline for thousands of women and children to ignore the advice of experts and put these vital services at risk would be a dangerous and a potentially fatal move over the last year in england and wales about million adults million women and men experienced domestic abuse according to official estimates womens aid and other campaigners as well as survivors of abuse have also called for a funding model for a national network of refuges the shadow cabinet member and former chief prosecutor keir starmer called for mandatory funding for refuges following coverage of the issue in the guardian joining a chorus of voices criticising the plans the labour mp and member of the women and equalities committee jess phillips has sponsored a commons debate on the issue for december the latest proposals drawn up by the department for communities and local government and department for work and pensions are seen as contradicting the prime ministers pledge to prioritise tackling domestic abuse theresa may this year unveiled plans for a major consultation across government which would result in a domestic violence and abuse bill consolidating relevant legislation and introducing new measures to help victims a government spokesperson said until the government is providing m of dedicated funding for tackling violence against women and girls this includes a m fund to support refuges and other accommodationbased services providing additional bed spaces we will publish a landmark draft domestic violence and abuse bill to protect and support victims recognise the lifelong impact domestic abuse has on children and make sure agencies effectively respond to domestic abuse womens aid surveyed about a third of

more than a million people most of them women reported domestic abuse to the police last year according to the latest figures from the ons the hidden crime is slowly starting to emerge from behind locked doors and curtained windows all the same it is estimated that no more than half of all offences are reported while successful prosecutions are still in a minority because so many victims have not yet found the security to feel able to bring charges most tragic are the women who die at the hands of their violent partners two deaths a week often foreseeable and therefore preventable the first step is to find a place where victim and children can feel safe but as the guardian reported new proposals on funding threaten the future of the very refuges that are best able to offer shelter and security last month the department for communities and local government set out plans to take away the entitlement to housing benefit from women using refuges and instead to give councils a ringfenced amount to be spent on all forms of shortstay supported housing the policy paper recognises the particular problems of providing shelter for domestic abuse victims who often need to flee hundreds of miles to escape their partner it argues it would be more efficient to have a stock of emergency housing available for people made homeless for any cause but as our report on the shocking experience of one woman showed accommodation that was supposedly suitable for any homeless person was quite unsuitable for children or for her a victim of abuse councils say they want the opportunity to test different solutions they point to the need to deal with the perpetrator and the unfairness of forcing the victim to flee they argue that it is much better to invest in services to prevent abuse than it is to pick up the pieces afterwards all this is true but it is not happening already a th of domestic violence services dont receive funding from their local authority at all it is all too easy to cut funding for victims of a crime that happens out of sight it is also all too easy to withdraw entirely from funding refuges victims usually flee their home town and become the responsibility of other councils the government proposals do include the nonstatutory obligation to provide spaces for victims of domestic abuse but the emphasis is on the value of local knowledge to meet local need and that often translates into widely varying levels of provision theresa may the prime minister and amber rudd the home secretary have both emphasised their concern to improve protection for abuse victims part of the strategy on violence against women and girls includes a separate review of services for them which does not conclude for another year nationalising the network of womens refuges is one idea that would make it easier to make sure there was an accessible place of safety in every community regardless of the attitude of the local authority it would ensure equal and transparent funding outside organisations could monitor spending levels and mps could hold ministers accountable it is a policy development that organisations such as womens aid believe could make a real difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children local services for local needs are often best but some problems demand a national strategy this is one of them this

keir starmer the shadow cabinet member and former chief prosecutor has called for mandatory funding for refuges amid criticism over a shakeup of funding for womens services abuse survivors and charities have warned the lives of vulnerable women and children will be put at risk by government plans to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system on average housing benefit makes up of refuge funding and as there is no obligation for local authorities to fund refuges is the last remaining guaranteed source of income the plans have been met with fierce criticism and calls for the proposals to be overhauled starmer the former director of public prosecutions dpp and shadow brexit secretary called for mandatory funding the proposals would mean women fleeing abusive partners will not be able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit the last guaranteed source of income available to refuges instead of being able to use housing benefit to fund refuges the government proposes handing a ringfenced grant to councils for shortterm supported housing however this does not exclusively cover refuges it is also aimed at older people homeless people offenders people with mental illnesses and drug addicts starmer was joined by a number of mps in criticising the move david lammy labour mp for tottenham told the guardian we urgently need to save womens refuges and other forms of supported housing that are reliant on housing benefit to stay open the government does not seem to understand that this is genuinely a matter of life and death and that refuges are a lifeline for those most in need we will not let this happen without a fight in the last few years we have seen a number of proposals to change the funding and regulations governing the operation of supported housing each of which have chipped away at these vital services i am seeing the impact of this on the ground in my constituency surgeries and in the casework i am getting every week and it is the same story right across the country sophie walker the leader of the womens equality party said the government must drop these shameful and damaging proposals as a matter of urgency over the last seven years specialist services for victims of domestic violence have been cut to the bone and womens aid are right to warn that it is a matter of life and death for women and children preventing housing benefit from being used to pay for refuges is the latest in a long line of policies that strip vulnerable people of support when they need it most forcing refuges to compete with other nonspecialist services for grants shows ministers have failed to take note of the damage already caused by the introduction of competitive tendering by bringing forward these plans now in the midst of the westminster sexual harassment scandal the government has also made clear that it does not understand or will not take the steps needed to address the endemic power imbalance that drives inequality the document detailing the proposals published in october contains a caveat that funding for refuges will be looked at in november but provides no further details or reassurance a government spokesperson said until the government is providing m of dedicated funding for tackling violence against women and girls this includes a m fund to support refuges and other accommodationbased services providing additional bed spaces we will publish a landmark draft domestic violence and abuse bill to protect and support victims recognise the lifelong impact domestic

freya fled her abusive partner in the middle of the night clutching her children and little else travelling hundreds of miles to escape the rape violence and psychological torture she had suffered for six months forced to sleep on the sofas of friends and an exboyfriend she called the domestic violence hotline to seek a place in a refuge but there were none available i was calling every single day for months begging she said im battered and raped and homeless with two kids in a shutterstock of flashbacks im suicidal how much worse can this be freya wants to share her experience because the government stealthily published proposals at the end of october for changes that would push services to the brink of extinction paragraph on page of a page document drawn up by the department for communities and local government and the department for work and pensions reveals plans to remove refuges and other shortterm supported housing from the welfare system meaning vulnerable women will not be able to pay for placements using housing benefit housing benefit is the last guaranteed source of income available to refuges and makes up about of their revenue charlotte kneer a survivor of domestic abuse and chief executive of the reigate and banstead womens aid refuge in surrey said if this goes ahead every single refuge will close and every woman who presents herself to a refuge is at risk of murder on average two women a week are killed by a partner or expartner in england and wales kneers refuge can house up to vulnerable women and children at a time it offers clean furnished rooms with televisions and teamaking facilities a communal living area and kitchen and a large garden with playground equipmentthe women who stay there have access to counsellors and advice on mental health housing job hunting and navigating the benefits system it needs about a year to keep running and just over onethird of the refuges funding comes from housing benefit a room for a week costs there are two fulltime support workers a parttime childrens worker and a parttime play therapistcumservice manager i dont sleep at night worrying about whether were going to be here next week next month next year kneer said i cant emphasise that to have these reforms on top of that worry it really is exhausting if refuges do not close the chances are that spaces available already outstripped by demand will dwindle furtheron the day she fled freya and her children would not have been alone in not securing a place in a refuge research by womens aid found women with children were turned away from refuge services in one day in from then on her plight worsened she approached a borough council for housing but was asked for a letter from her abuser admitting he had been abusive as well as passports and id she had had no time to gather as she fled evetually freya was able to get a place in a mixedsex hostel but it was not fit for purpose she described an overcrowded building with no fire escapes shared bathrooms without locks on no hot water and faeces and blood on the walls homeless men with monitoring tags on their ankles roamed the corridors its likely youre housing perpetrators with survivors she said every night i was listening to people suffer trauma fighting when i was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder after complaining she was moved to a womens hostel which was more secure but still unbearable babies were being born in there she said we were forced to sleep on tile floors with plastic mattresses there were no blankets pillows toilet paper sanitary provisions we were forced to sleep under our coats she complained again and was permanently discharged into the private rental market then moved to a neighbouring authority she has been in a dilapidated property with her two daughters for a year freya mused on what life might have been like had she accessed a refuge you have no support and get better yourself while being responsible for children she said if i had been able to gain access to a refuge it would have been far less traumatic she pointed out that when faced with such dire circumstances women will often return to their abusers im fleeing from my life as it is and ive fled and im still probably going to die she said very often i felt it would be easier to go back to my abuser and tolerate that abuse helen another domestic abuse survivor came close to missing a space in a refuge she had been with her partner for a few months when he started pushing her on her birthday he threw her to the floor and strangled her she was able to fight him off and fled the house with her baby daughter he was convicted but handed a conditional discharge she was placed in a hostel in another county in the room next to her was a drug dealer she slept with the bed up against the door but a space in a refuge came through and after a week in the hostel she was moved i walked through the door and i was asked what do you need she said and i just started crying i told them i needed sanitary towels baby milk nappies they provided me with items i had taken for granted for so long over seven months the refuge provided her with the assistance needed to transition back into a normal life advice on claiming benefits finding a home assistance with the courts and food donations now she is married with two more children and works as a social media manager if that refuge and that support i received was not there i would have gone back and would still be in that position today she said helen said blocking refuges from accessing housing benefit undermines the women who have been abused survivors of domestic abuse already find it hard to admit that its happened to them theres still a taboo around it and this decision will make women feel like theyre not being believed she said kneer believes she has taken in about women since she started working at the refuge if a room becomes available it will be taken up within a few hours during her time with her husband kneer was struck on the head with a lamp and threatened with a knife she fled to a refuge but returned to her abuser after one night later they split and she was able to start a life without him two years after joining the refuge in kneer supported a prosecution against her exhusband along with two other women he was convicted of causing actual bodily harm and threats to kill and was jailed for four years she was haunted for many years by the emotional and psychological effects of abuse if i see someone come in and theyre totally broken ill make sure they know were going to hold them until theyre able to hold themselves kneer said freya and helen agreed to their names being changed for this piece to protect their identities,2017-11,freya fled abusive

the lives of vulnerable women and children will be put at risk by proposed changes to funding for refuges abuse survivors and charities have warned in littlepublicised proposals the government plans to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system it would mean vulnerable women fleeing abusive partners will not be able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit the last guaranteed source of income available to refuges on average housing benefit makes up of refuge funding katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said the governments proposed reforms to supported housing will dismantle our national network of lifesaving refuges and put the lives of women and children trying to escape domestic abuse at risk this is a matter of life or death on average two women a week are killed by a partner or expartner in england and wales under the current spending model womens aid found women with children were turned away from refuge services in one day the warnings come as days an international campaign to end violence against women and girls is launched instead of being able to use housing benefit to fund refuges the government proposes handing a ringfenced grant to councils for shortterm supported housing however this does not exclusively cover refuges it is also aimed at older people homeless people offenders people with mental illnesses and drug addicts refuge staff and survivors of abuse told the guardian that while they have a positive relationship with some authorities others are less engaged more than of domestic abuse organisations receive no council funding the majority of women in refuges come from outside the authority with some travelling hundreds of miles from the far reaches of england and wales for security reasons councils can be reluctant to spend cash on those from other counties and are more likely to focus on local people meaning a higher probability of a ringfenced grant being spent on homeless or elderly people ghose said if pursued the reforms will result in a postcode lottery of domestic abuse support services with further refuges being forced to close their doors and more women and children being turned away from the lifesaving support they offer she said without a safe space to escape to more women and childrens lives will be lost to domestic abuse the document detailing the proposed changes contains a caveat that funding for refuges will be looked at in november but provides no further details or reassurance the reforms fly in the face of pledges made by the prime minister to make it a key personal priority to transform the way the uk tackles domestic violence a government spokesperson said domestic violence and abuse is a devastating crime that shatters the lives of victims and families this government is determined to ensure anyone facing the threat of domestic abuse has somewhere to turn to until the government is providing m of dedicated funding for tackling violence against women and girls this includes a m fund to support refuges and other accommodationbased services providing additional bed spaces we will publish a landmark draft domestic violence and abuse bill to protect and support victims recognise the lifelong impact domestic abuse has on children and make sure agencies effectively respond to domestic abuse earlier this year theresa may unveiled plans for a major consultation across government would result in the domestic violence and abuse bill consolidating other relevant legislation and introducing new measures to help victims the latest threat to funding is a particular blow as campaigners and charities had been cheered by a government uturn on plans that would have seen refuges hit by the housing benefit cap if you have a new law that improves the criminal justice response you can have the best police response in the world for a woman who is seeking to escape an abusive relationship but if she doesnt have the specialist services in her community to go to then that response will be really undermined ghose said,2017-11,life vulnerable woman child put risk proposed change funding refuge abuse survivor

text messages sent by a university student who killed herself following an abusive relationship will be shared on campuses across scotland as part of a campaign to raise awareness of domestic violence among young people emily drouet then studying law at aberdeen university texted friends in the weeks before her death in march she described her emotionally and physically violent relationship with fellow student angus milligan insisting its my fault i made him so angry and i deserve it this litany of selfrecrimination is being publicised with the permission of emilys mother fiona who is spearheading a poster campaign to alert young women to the insidious nature of domestic violence and calling for university staff to be trained to recognise signs of abuse the texts make for distressing reading in one exchange emilys friend told her sweetie please you dont deserve i do replied emily no you dont insisted the friend you dont deserve to be hit or strangled report him to the police emily i am serious emily replied i deserve it in another exchange the student described being choked by her boyfriend saying it scared me so much i just cant bear it i know i should do something dont be alone please begged another friend fiona drouet said sharing her daughters messages had been painful it was really sad for us to read through the texts on her phone after we lost her but its important to show that this is all part of the manipulation that happens emily was a strong young woman and yet she was made to feel this way the text messages were in stark contrast to her abiding memories of her daughter the best word for emily was bubbly she bounced into rooms always smiling she said for drouet the challenge is clear how do we get young women to understand that this can happen to them and that help is available young women dont imagine themselves as being victims of domestic violence its that word domestic they imagine it has to happen in a family home or in a longterm relationship its getting them to understand that there is no discrimination when it comes to violence against women wed also emphasise that violence against women takes many forms emily was subjected to significant mental abuse and you can see that emotional abuse is just as damaging as physical milligan who admitted assault and threatening behaviour was sentenced in july to hours unpaid work noting it was not appropriate for the court to speculate on the reasons for drouets death sheriff malcolm garden went on to characterise milligans controlling and ultimately violent approach to their relationship the couple started dating after meeting during their first term in at his trial at aberdeen sheriff court milligan a descendant of the philanthropist andrew carnegie who attended fettes college in edinburgh before enrolling at aberdeen was described by students as the alpha male on the campus he pleaded guilty to assaulting emily eight days before her death when he seized her by the neck choked and slapped her and also admitted sending her offensive text messages over a sixweek period calling her a slut and bitch and behaving in a threatening manner five other charges including over an alleged attempt to choke his girlfriend minutes before she killed herself were dropped because of a lack of evidence milligan was subsequently expelled from his psychology course by aberdeen university supported by nus scotland the poster campaign that carries a striking portrait of emily will launch on saturday with student associations across the country encouraged to lobby their institutions to improve oncampus services so that students and staff know where to get help drouet has also developed the emilytest which asks would this have helped someone in emilys situation to ensure policies and procedures would help in reallife situations key to her campaign is a call for mandatory training for staff drouet said she was haunted by what ifs after learning her daughter approached a student resident assistant in aberdeen before she died when asked if the difficulties she described included physical violence emily denied it and said she did not want to get her boyfriend in trouble no further action was taken nor were the police or her parents contacted aberdeen university has since said it has to balance students rights as adults with its responsibility to offer support and that the action taken was appropriate based on the information received i would like to see mandatory training for university staff rolled out across scotland and then into england and wales said drouet part of that training is bystander awareness encouraging nonprofessionals to find safe ways to intervene and interrupt abusive behaviour its not just listening to what people are saying but also observing behavioural changes emilys friends are heartbroken that they didnt recognise the gravity of milligans actions if you suspect someone is being abused and speak up you can save a life emilys mother described a young woman who enjoyed baking sailing and playing the clarinet she adored justin beiber and was a francophile having spent many holidays in her fathers home country she had so many dreams and would have fulfilled them all if she had just been given the chance in the uk samaritans can be contacted on in the us the national suicide prevention lifeline is in

more than nurseries and childminders have gone out of business in england since the conservative government was elected in with a promise of hours of free childcare for working parents official ofsted figures obtained by tracy brabin the shadow minister for early years show there has been a net loss of nurseries and childminders from the early years register since in total childcare providers have left the register while only have joined fourfifths of those who left the register had been rated either good or outstanding by ofsted the tories promised to be the most familyfriendly government ever but time and again they are failing working families said brabin ministers ask earlyyears providers to do more and more but refuse to give them the necessary funding if they were serious about giving every child the best start in life they would give providers the resources they need instead of managing the decline of the sector content to see thousands of providers lost year after year brabin was alarmed that so many of the providers leaving the register were rated good or outstanding we need to do more to encourage those that are known to deliver to stay in the sector the loss of over providers since may is a sign of a system in crisis brabin has repeatedly criticised the government for underfunding the socalled free scheme which entitles the parents of three and fouryearold children to hours of childcare during term time equivalent to weeks if both work and each earns less than the preschool learning alliance and the professional association for childcare and early years say local authorities typically pay nurseries and childminders just an hour to provide the free hours to parents leaving nurseries facing an average annual shortfall in funds and the average childminder out of pocket by more than per child per year as a result of nurseries and childminders have been unable to offer the hours entirely for free according to a recent survey of childcare providers by the champagne nurseries on lemonade funding group similar research published in nursery world reveals some nurseries have come up with unethical ways to pass the cost of providing the scheme back on to parents sanjay morzaria who runs little darling childcare in harrow faces a daily shortfall in funding from his local authority for each hour place he provides but under the rules of the scheme he is not allowed to openly charge parents a compulsory topup fee to make up the difference he thinks this is unfair ive had to think in a very deceitful way to find a way around a government policy that would hurt my business he has started charging parents of children who are eligible for hours of governmentfunded childcare a day for lunch these parents can opt instead to take their child home for the lunch hour but they must arrive dead on time each lunchtime or pay a penalty for every five minutes they are early or late for pick up and drop off the contract was drawn up by one of our parents who is a senior partner in an international law firm says morzaria parents who do not qualify for the hour scheme are offered a different contract with no lunch fees or late penalties to pay its unethical and totally unfair but i dont have a choice either i do this or i say sorry im not having your child because i cant afford it or i accept the child and i go bankrupt parents whose children are eligible for the hour scheme pay a new charge of a day to cover the cost of lunch and extracurricular activities at the abacus ark chain of nurseries in london we have to do what were doing because wed shut down otherwise said owner anthony ioannou parents who do not agree to pay the voluntary contribution are not offered places at his nurseries ethically it doesnt feel right im being asked to lie to parents i wish the government would stop saying the hours are free because theyre not the sector has written an open letter to chancellor philip hammond before the budget on wednesday pleading for the government to increase its funding of childcare and warning that the situation is about to reach a crisis point nearly of childcare providers surveyed by the preschool learning alliance think their businesses will no longer be sustainable at the end of this academic year children and families minister robert goodwill said we are determined to support as many families as possible with access to highquality affordable childcare and earlier this year we fulfilled our promise to double the free childcare available to working parents to hours a week saving them up to a year per child hundreds of thousands of hardworking families are already benefiting from that offer,2017-11,nursery childminders gone business england since conservative government

local authority childrens services are being reduced to crisisdriven firefighting as a result of crippling central government funding cuts according to a report three leading childrens charities are warning that early intervention services designed to prevent problems escalating and children suffering a crisis have been hardest hit by budget cuts as a result councils can only afford to get involved when children have already reached crisis point which may then result in more costly interventions such as being taken into care the charities say the turning the tide report by the childrens society action for children and the national childrens bureau says council spending on early intervention services designed to spot signs of neglect and abuse fell by between and the bn government funding cuts come at a time of growing demand for childrens services with a increase in child protection investigations according to the report the report also claimed that the poorest children have been the hardest hit with the most deprived councils in england cutting spending on childrens services by almost a quarter six times as much as the least deprived councils sir tony hawkhead the chief executive of action for children said leaving local authorities without the necessary resources to help children and families at an early stage has a devastating cost both in social and financial terms with no longterm solution on the table childrens services are on an unstable and dangerous footing were calling on the government to prioritise the services children need before this crisis turns into a catastrophe for the next generation of children and families among the early intervention services affected by the cuts are parenting classes childrens and youth centres substance misuse prevention teenage pregnancy support and short breaks for disabled children matthew reed the chief executive of the childrens society added councils are being denied the funding they need to provide safe effective childrens services and spending on vital support is collapsing as a result we are at a tipping point with more cuts yet to come the government must step up and give councils the funds

its that time of year again yesterday marked the day in the calendar when women start working for free it has become a grim marker of gender inequality and a stark illustration of the fact that womens labour is effectively treated beyond a certain point as slavery but even with this stark fact that the gender pay gap remains so large that were women to refuse to accept it we could down tools in november we are at risk of becoming acclimatised to it approaching it with outrage but also resignation at the rate at which the gap is narrowing or not in some cases for women in their s it is now widening it will take over a century to close how do we climb out of this mire equal pay for equal work it doesnt sound unreasonable but the discount applied to womens labour is part of a much bigger economic equation one that factors in childbirth and maternity leave as net drags on womens contribution crucially the discount is also founded on the notion that a womans pay is a womans problem as if women live in a parallel universe it is the same attitude that considers maternity leave or flexible hours a sort of indulgence rather than the necessary arrangements that often allow another partner to go to work it is overwhelmingly when it comes to equal rights for women and minorities that people lose their imaginations and view disparities and unfairness as immutable facts of biology or economics they simply are not the same was thought once of votes for women unequal pay in the uk now stuck for the past three years at around persists because of legislative footdragging and cultural complacency after the bbcs yawning gender pay gap was revealed what was shocking wasnt only that the institution felt it was appropriate in the first place for male presenters to earn so much more than women it was also the sort of shrugging sheepishness with which some of the men involved not all responded as if to say well this is rather awkward but how is it my fault that i benefit from institutional sexism take it up with the man upstairs do you really expect us to unilaterally split our pay cheques with women to walk out in protest well no but men can lobby on womens behalf and we can all if they are public figures take them to task if they fail to be vocal and if things do not change a grilling by mps last week resulted in a concession from the bbc director general tony hall that there will be pay cuts as well as pay rises this is a good example of how public scrutiny can yield results the way forward is a combination of policy and cultural initiatives neither of which comes about without some unpleasantness unequal pay is like all the other things from which women suffer such as sexual harassment or their careers stalling after having children exposure and shaming of offenders and the public application of pressure are all necessary if action is to match the severity of the problem legislation that came into force in april meanwhile seems more likely to make things worse in demanding that companies publish general averages of mens and womens pay without a breakdown or any remedial plan the governments new rules are shaping up to be another boxticking pain for companies that will do nothing but entrench the view that hiring women is a reporting headache the gender pay gap is also intersectional with the data showing that for women from minorities and disabled women it is larger illustrating how this reflects societal imbalances people being overpaid for no other reason than their gender class or race is being dressed up as experience of course there are challenges that are not all rooted in institutional sexism its always easier to start employees on less than they should accept than give them a raise or pay them more than they would expect all the more reason that aggressive corrective measures need to be taken without delay,2017-11,time year yesterday marked day calendar woman start working free ha become grim marker gender inequality

the exclusion of fostered children from the additional hours of free childcare a week available to parents in england is discriminatory and inexplicable charities have said the governments flagship childcare policy which takes the potential number of free hours for parents of three and fouryearolds up to in total was introduced in september but contained a specific exclusion if the child is your foster child thirteen charities including action for children become the british association of social workersand the care leavers association have denounced the prohibition and are demanding that it be removed in a letter to the guardian they write children aged three and four across england are now entitled to an extra hours of free childcare each week with the exception of fostered children who have been explicitly and inexplicably excluded we are calling on the childrens minister robert goodwill to urge him to reverse this discriminatory decision with immediate effect fostered children must have access to the same opportunities as other children the charities say grandparents and others who foster members of their own family would particularly benefit from access to the additional hours a week as would longterm carers the signatories which also include children england coram baaf and the national association of independent reviewing officers stress that foster carers who are often struggling to make ends meet should be given as much help as possible a survey published by the fostering network last month found that the majority of foster carers in england are unpaid or underpaid with only one in receiving the equivalent of the national living wage for a hour week additionally childcare costs charged by nurseries have risen steeply in recent years daniel sinclair communications manager at the fostering network which also signed the letter said not all foster parents will take up the hours but it ought to be left to their judgment and that of the social worker some fostered children thrive when surrounded by their peers this government and the previous government have encouraged people to foster by saying you can combine fostering with working outside the home but the foster parents will have to pay for the additional hours or enter into difficult negotiations with the fostering service theres no obligation for the fostering service to pay for that to claim hours of childcare both parents must be in work and earning at least the national living wage or for those under the national minimum wage for hours a week when the inclusion or otherwise of foster carers was discussed in the house of lords in july the schools minister john nash said whether foster care is considered work under the eligibility criteria for this additional childcare support is complicated lord nash was responding to representations by the crossbench peer francis hare who said research showed that many of the young children going into care had mental health issues that had not been flagged up so he said it was important they got the opportunity of being in a highquality early years setting where those missed mental health issues may be identified hare said it was crucial for foster carers to have all the possible incentives to continue in what they do the policy has been criticised for targeting working parents who can earn up to each and still be eligible rather than prioritising access for the most deprived families who may not qualify the other organisations that signed the letter to the guardian were coram voice the national youth advocacy service

it was like a slave and a ruler who stayed together says sahila ahmed describing her relationship with her husband of years as the kids got older things actually got worse i didnt want them to see those fights and ask mummy why are you angry ahmed who arrives at the offices of slough childrens services trust looking calm collected and wearing a delicately flowered headscarf gives a tentative smile as she recounts fleeing with her children to a refuge hundreds of miles away after more than a decade of conflict that included occasional violence i was really suffocated in the relationship i got to the point where it was affecting me mentally and physically and then my children i thought my boys will grow into that man like my husband is it might seem that ahmed had taken a firm decision to leave her husband for good but in fact within weeks she opted to go back this is a yoyo pattern all too familiar to police and social workers with domestic abuse victims often blamed as a result for failing to keep their children safe but judging women in this way fails to address the reality that when children are involved mothers will often want to keep the family together last week womens aid lambasted the governments new housing support proposals which would devolve funding for domestic violence services to cashstrapped local authorities the charity warned that the proposals would lead to more refuges and domestic violence support services being forced to close endangering the lives of women and children katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said the government will remove a womans individual entitlement to support with her housing costs when she flees domestic abuse to a refuge as well as refuges last secure form of funding on the same day buttle uk a charity providing financial support to help children in crisis released figures showing it had seen a surge in the number of grant applications by families affected by domestic abuse up by last year compared to there is no doubt that the stakes are high according to the most recent crime figures for three women are killed every fortnight by a partner or expartner the usual response to domestic abuse from social services is either you leave and we support you or you dont and we do something with the children and that might be to remove them says sue penna a psychotherapist specialising in trauma and recovery from domestic abuse and though some people do need help to leave there has always been she says a complete lack of services for couples who despite worrying levels of emotional and physical abuse choose to stay together its why penna created a week programme called inspiring families it was piloted last summer by slough childrens services trust the vehicle set up by the government to run sloughs childrens services department in after a critical ofsted report and a review the programme is specifically aimed at couples who have chosen not to separate and offers weekly twohour small group sessions run by trained facilitators who are all qualified social workers and family support workers the womens groups take place separately to the mens and the programme aims to give social work professionals a robust assessment of the current level of danger the likelihood of future risk and importantly a detailed insight into the couples ability and motivation to change the dynamics destroying their relationship couples then have homework to do typically doing nice joint activities with their partners and any children as well as keeping reflective diaries about their own and their partners behaviour thoughts and feelings if you look at serious case reviews after child deaths or domestic homicide reviews after a domestic murder what keeps coming up is that there wasnt an understanding of the dynamics within that family says penna as well as being an assessment tool the programme also acts as an early intervention to help individuals examine and address the relationship issues that are troubling them we do quite a lot about what the impact of domestic abuse is on children that is something people often dont realise and its a big motivator to take part says penna albert ashton the facilitator of the mens group says that participants are constantly challenged in the sessions what men find really hard to own is the physical abuse he says you see how they compartmentalise they start with we argue and its her as much as me i say yes but lets look at your behaviour there is a lot of shame in the room participants on the inspiring families programme have been ethnically mixed although only couples of asian or mixed asianeastern european origins agreed to speak to the guardian ahmed and her husband nasser khan were referred on to the initial pilot by their childrens social worker on ahmeds return to slough from the refuge for both husband and wife the process appears to have been transformative some of it is quite painful it puts a mirror up to your personality says khan speaking to me separately from the interview i do with ahmed emotionally it was draining ive done a lot of soulsearching its given me a new perspective on life he agreed to go on the programme because he was worried he would lose contact with his children if his wife left again financial pressures have clearly had a major impact on this familys wellbeing working seven days a week all i remember is being in a daze because youre so tired says khan its an absolute struggle when youre working all hours under the sun and still cant make ends meet you reach a tipping point its not about pinning the blame on your upbringing but seeing youre stuck in a cycle and how to get out he has he says had to do a complete relationship reset ahmed says that though she was a bit scared about rekindling their relationship she has since gained a lot of self confidence and courage from working through the homework with her husband after each weekly session there have been no more violent episodes since they started on the pilot and their case is now closed to childrens services ahmed looks happy and self assured and not frightened any more but when i meet deepa kumar who has come into the trust for her final group session its evident that the programme is not a magic wand a violent incident leading to police involvement prompted her and her husbands referral but kumar does not seem entirely confident that the improvement she describes in her home life will be sustained does she feel she can trust her husband there is a long pause he is not a bad person she says quietly i think i can trust him but sometimes things go wrong i interview her husband nav kumar separately does he still worry about violence his tone is serious yeah because all couples fight but its about how you deal with it my wife and kid are my future and theyre the priority asked if the programme puts women in more danger penna replies were not making the situation any more dangerous because that risk is there anyway and we are seeing them every week so were proactively managing that risk and there have been incidents where a decision has been made to escalate of the families who took part in the first three cohorts only two have so far been rereferred because of domestic abuse incidents inspiring families also claims to provide good value for money with domestic abuse costing the public sector an estimated bn a year an independent assessment of the first nine couples showed overall savings to the taxpayer of for every pound spent through reduced demand for nhs police child protection or other services and increased wellbeing of participants and their families and the programme is attracting attention from other charities and local authorities it is already being implemented by an organisation in wales and another in sussex says penna with six more interested including four councils my hope is that by better understanding the dynamics we can help families make better sense of whats going on and be active in managing their lives says penna says ahmed i used to be scared of my husband but he knows how he has to behave and how he has to control his temper

following a colleagues retirement i have now become the safeguarding lead for children at my gp practice this means that i review cases update our practice policies on safeguarding children and act as a liaison between staff families school nurses paediatricians and social services like many other gps i come across cases of emotional or physical neglect through poverty or parents having mental health or substance abuse problems sometimes it is the police aampe or health visitors who alert me to concerns they have about a childs welfare but worryingly for every child on the child protection register there are another eight who are not known to agencies according to the nspcc and this can only get worse as cuts to local authority childrens services continue since the care quality commission asks that all gps do at least two hours safeguarding training a year mine has focused on real cases of neglect and abuse we discuss these cases with failings highlighted often at multiple points where a child may have come into contact with health professionals it has helped us to make informed and early referrals to child protection the decision to make a safeguarding referral is not one taken lightly but once done often help is either very hard to access or just not available its usually not the social workers fault the reality is that the child protection system is simply unable to keep up with demand for example when i refer daisy not her real name who is three years old to the child protection team for neglect her mother is struggling with alcohol use and daisy is malnourished and physically and emotionally left to fend for herself her nursery attendance is poor after some delay the social worker decides that daisy should not have a child protection plan but is a child in need instead an allocation that comes with little resources or practical support for daisy or her mother the systems focus is on severe cases such as those of physical or sexual abuse rather than prevention through early help for less severe cases childrens social services have lost bn in savage funding cuts despite the growth in safeguarding referrals up between and for adults and children vacancy rates for social workers are high and longterm sickness common meaning caseloads often have to be reallocated childrens social services cuts have also slashed the early help and intervention that young people and families used to receive such as through sure start or similar schemes social workers do a very difficult job in a system under huge strain yet from a doctors perspective it often feels as if the threshold for accepting safeguarding referrals is governed more by the level of demand or staffing on the day than the severity of the case this is particularly true for issues of neglect or where there are parental mental health or substance misuse problems when i have been asked to access help for the parent rather than focus on the child as well my experience is echoed across the country many gps says they find it hard to access timely support from social services and lengthy delays unclear pathways or ineffective responses to safeguarding concerns are common complaints where is the effective response for them when thresholds for taking action remain ambiguous or sky high or funding cuts mean that early help is lacking as gps become more proficient in spotting the signs of neglect and abuse we are likely to make more safeguarding referrals but without more funding for childrens services we will be only adding to the pressure on social workers it seems illconceived that the government has pushed for widespread safeguarding training but not planned at all for its aftermath zara aziz is a gp partner in northeast

two years after new domestic abuse laws made coercive or controlling behaviour criminal offences for the first time police forces remain poorly trained and illequipped to deal with the new crimes mps and campaigners say latest official figures show that only eight out of police forces across england and wales have rolled out a new national training programme and this lack of training is reflected in the low number of prosecutions involving the new offences a recent freedom of information request by the bureau for investigative journalism revealed that just charges have been brought under the new laws in the police force areas that responded to the request six police forces have brought five charges or fewer since the new offences were brought into force on december the office for national statistics says police forces recorded only cases of coercive or controlling behaviour in the months to march this is against a backdrop in which it is officially estimated that million women and men have suffered some form of domestic violence in the past year a recent university of gloucestershire report found that controlling behaviour was an element in of domestic murders they had studied elfyn llwyd the plaid cymru mp whose minute rule bill in february first proposed the new offence said he was frustrated that there had been such a poor takeup of training by police forces across the country which had been reflected in the low number of prosecutions the official definition of coercive and controlling behaviour is an act or a pattern of acts of assault threats humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used by an individual to harm punish or frighten their victim controlling behaviour is officially defined as a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate andor dependent by isolating them from sources of support exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain depriving them of the means needed for independence resistance and escape and regulating their everyday behaviour examples can include preventing victims from seeing friends stopping them from having hobbies controlling their finances or where they are allowed to go llywds private members bill led to the government bringing forward its own legislation which was due to be enacted in march however concerns raised by plaid cymru about the need for police training before the new offence came into effect led to its delay and it finally reached the statute book on december exactly two years ago llwyd said it was important that coercive and controlling behaviour were made criminal offences and i am proud to have secured that step forward but that it has been so poorly followed up by the westminster government is very frustrating particularly given the warnings plaid cymru made at the time that the police needed to be trained the poor takeup of training amongst the welsh and english police forces is reflected in the low number of prosecutions the westminster government must now ensure that training is made mandatory and funded centrally the home office minister nick hurd told mps in a commons written answer earlier this month that the new college of policing training programme domestic abuse matters which focuses on improved evidence gathering and understanding of controlling and coercive behaviour had been rolled out in eight police forces so far and plans were in place to roll it out in a further two in addition the college national curriculum relating to domestic abuse and coercive control is embedded in full into national recruit training and the college has published authorised professional practice on investigating domestic violence and abuse capturing controlling or coercive behaviour the minister added but llwyd and plaid cyrmus home affairs spokesperson liz saville roberts said the home office needed to fund a centrally procured training programme for the police to ensure there were adequately informed on the new law harry fletcher director of the victims rights campaign who was involved in drafting the new law said it was essential that ministers recognised that psychological abuse in a domestic setting was made an offence but training was critical indeed we asked for a sixmonth delay so that it could be delivered to the police the latest figures for prosecutions started is extremely worrying and is no doubt related to the training failures there needs to be a cultural shift amongst police mangers and first responders we would urge that government invest in such training without delay he said,2017-12,two

around police scotland officers are to receive specialist training in preparation for a new domestic abuse crime coming into force in scotland which is believed to be unique in law internationally the training will help officers spot seemingly innocuous actions which are in fact part of a cycle of psychological abuse or coercive control although an offence of coercive control was introduced in england in the scottish legislation takes a unique approach which has been hailed as offering victimless prosecution it reflects a growing understanding that domestic abuse is often a course of behaviour that extends over a period of time and includes not only physical violence the domestic abuse bill which reaches its final stage through holyrood early next year will create a specific offence which will cover not only physical domestic abuse but other forms of psychological abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour that cannot easily be prosecuted using the existing criminal law it allows the police and courts to pursue someone on a course of conduct offence that is a single offence where physical psychological and coercive behaviour can be prosecuted at once this course of conduct offence includes a reasonable person test for example would a reasonable person consider that limiting a womans access to her bank account or prescribing her meal times amounted to controlling behaviour the chief executive of scottish womens aid marsha scott said women have been telling us for years that it is emotional abuse that is most harmful this is a unique way to draft legislation that allows for victimless prosecution of domestic violence because you dont have to prove harm to the victim because of the reasonable person test it could reduce the revictimisation of women in court its a shift in the culture to focus on the perpetrator rather than the victim and concentrating on the key question of how we stop men abusing since the introduction of the english coercive control legislation concerns have been raised that it is not being used enough and has created an unhelpful hierarchy of harms in part due to a lack of specialist training for police officers committing to funding the officer training on thursday the justice secretary michael matheson said attitudes towards domestic abuse are changing its no longer seen as a private matter or no business of criminal law were doing everything we can to tackle the scourge that is domestic abuse at every opportunity supporting victims tackling perpetrators with enhanced legislation and also tackling the underlying attitudes and inequalities that very often create the conditions for violence against women and girls to take place theres no place for it in scotland and this new funding will greatly assist in tackling it the assistant chief constable of police scotland gillian macdonald said specialist training would help officers to spot the signs of domestic abuse we know that the controlling behaviours used by perpetrators to maintain power and control over victims can be both devious and devastating however to those outside the relationship the ways in which a perpetrator will conceal their actions can often make them appear innocuous in isolation we have committed to this critical training to address these issues so our officers and staff can better recognise the signs of controlling behaviours in domestic abuse support victims and bring perpetrators to justice,2017-12,around police scotland officer receive specialist training preparation new domestic abuse crime

financial restrictions on access to justice are always problematic but further restrictions on legal aid for victims of domestic violence introduced in were particularly egregious just how much hardship these cuts have caused in the past five years has been made plain in new figures from the ministry of justice in the first nine months of this year alleged victims faced at least one family court hearing without representation more than double the number in the situation had become so clearly awful that campaigners succeeded in getting some restrictions lifted as of january evidence of abuse occurring after five years have passed will be admissible and the evidence of support groups will be allowed also a wider review was launched in october into the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act of legislation that removed more than m from the legal aid budget leading to what amnesty has described as a twotier justice system the idea that you can litigate in person armed only with the simple sword of truth is a romantic one the reality is that legal processes are highly formalised with amateur involvement inevitably causing expensive adjournments foreseeable delays and multiple returns to court inadequate representation burns money and time inching back towards the status quo is not enough especially in those cases involving domestic abuse even in an alarming people were representing themselves sometimes for the incredibly frustrating reason that the financial assets of the relationship they wished to escape looked healthy but in reality were still controlled by the partner who was allegedly abusing its often said that its hard for victims of domestic abuse to represent themselves because they risk coming face to face with their abuser its easy to understand why someone would be afraid to be in a room with a person who has hit and physically abused them but thats only part of the story physical violence is in the majority of cases preceded by psychological and emotional abuse its in that period that the victim is primed to stay even when the relationship becomes violent even if it never does become violent psychological abuse can be more debilitating than physical abuse and even harder to prove the grooming is hard to shake off too it fosters guilt and shame in the victim she though its by no means always a she assumes a feeling of responsibility for the aggressors behaviour but the really crucial thing to understand is that the primary motivation of the abuse is not even to make the victim feel bad its to make the aggressor feel good and in a remarkably creepy way not only does the victim assume responsibility the aggressor also absolves himself of responsibility his projection works both ways she feels guilt

thousands of domestic violence victims are having to represent themselves in family courts with government figures showing the number without lawyers has doubled over the last five years following cuts to legal aid the labour party and campaigners expressed alarm after figures from the ministry of justice moj showed victims had no legal representation in at least one hearing during the first nine months of this year this contrasts with the same period in when there were victims had no legal representation gloria de piero the shadow justice minister said the figures showed the need for urgent government action to address the issue these figures show the shocking effect of the governments cavalier changes to legal aid she said thousands of victims of domestic violence are being forced to represent themselves in court against their abuser to seek protection for themselves and their children refuge a charity that helps women who experience domestic violence said increasing numbers of them had no option but to face their abusive expartners in the courts sandra horley the chief executive of refuge said legal aid cuts have had an enormous impact on women escaping domestic violence she said countless are forced either to fund their own case or remain at risk many of the women refuge supports have no choice but to represent themselves in court where they can end up face to face with abusive expartners earlier this month the moj scrapped muchcriticised restrictions on access to legal aid for victims of domestic violence which limited the categories of acceptable evidence and said aid would only be given where abuse could be shown to have taken place in the previous five years horley said the move was welcome but did not go far enough much more needs to be done to ensure that the legal aid system recognises the unique financial challenges faced by the women refuge supports too many women are currently turned away because they appear to own assets or savings which are actually under their abusers control an moj spokesman said it has long been the case that some people represent themselves in the family court but we want to increase the support available to them since the government has invested m of funding to support litigants in person through a range of measures designed to provide additional information support and guidance led by the advice voluntary and pro bono sectors the government has faced widespread criticism for making significant cuts to legal aid in in an attempt to save m a year as part of wider austerity measures critics of the the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act including judges and human rights groups say family courts in particular have been inundated with unrepresented litigants and that the cuts are a false economy because they usually result in other spending elsewhere government statistics show spending on legal aid fell from bn in to bn in with a significant decline in when the new rules came into force in october the new justice secretary david lidington said his department would review the impact of the cuts de piero said however that rather than wait months for the

foster children will be entitled to the same amount of free childcare as other children a minister has announced the governments flagship childcare policy which increased the potential number of free hours a week for three and fouryearolds up to in total was introduced in september but contained a specific exclusion if the child is your foster child which campaigners branded discriminatory and inexplicable the uturn was announced by the children and families minister robert goodwill during a westminster hall debate tabled by the labour mp lisa nandy who has been leading the campaign on the issue according to the minister in the first term of the new policy children were in a hours place with more than already signed up to access the offer in january goodwill said in a statement we want to build on this great start which is why im pleased to announce today that we will be extending our hours offer to foster carers we will set out more detail about how we will deliver this in the debate goodwill called the issue vital and said that children in foster care should have access to the same support and opportunities he said since it was brought to my attention i have been looking carefully at the issue of the current exclusion from the hours policy for children in foster care i have instructed my officials to work up plans to allow children in foster care to take up the additional hours where it is right for the child to do so we will work with local authorities fostering service providers and others in the sector to ensure we implement this change in a way that promotes the best interest of the child and i will set out more detail on how we will deliver this shortly nandy tweeted that she was grateful that ministers had acted campaigners fostering providers and childcare organisations celebrated the successful campaign in a statement the fostering network charity said it was delighted by the decision and expressed thanks to the department for education for hearing their concerns the statement said it is vital that fostered children are not discriminated against and the reversal of this decision will ensure that for this particular issue they are being treated in the same way as their peers neil leitch the chief executive of the preschool learning alliance welcomed the change he said all too often discussions around the hours are fixated on the backtowork agenda with little consideration given to the impact of policy decisions on the child and so todays decision marks a welcome change of focus it is of course vital that alongside muchneeded general early years funding reforms the sector is adequately supported to deliver the additional places that will be needed as a result of this change and we await further information on how the government intends to ensure this but were clear that this was the right decision to take it is unclear when the change will come into force the fostering network said it did not believe the change would come into affect until september an education department official could not confirm this however and said more details would be released shortly,2017-12,foster child entitled amount free

essex police and county council have defended a social media campaign on domestic violence after critics accused it of encouraging survivors to stay with perpetrators the police force came under fire on social media after posting a tweet about sheila which told the story of a woman who knew that the abuse in her relationship was wrong but the couple had been supported and stayed together but safely essex police attracted further criticism after writing on their facebook page that the stories included people who had left abusive relationships and those who wanted to stay in a relationship where less harmful abuse was taking place and had found safety and happiness doing that the force apologised for its use of clumsy language on twitter our message in this campaign isnt stay in any relationship no matter how abusive its if something is happening in your relationship even if youve been with someone for decades there is help you can get the writer and campaigner jack monroe had previously tweeted the story was released as part of a campaign on the living well essex website by the southend essex and thurrock domestic abuse board councillor dick madden the chair of the board said it had been developed in consultation with specialists refuges and survivors the focus of the campaign is people aged over who are too often a forgotten group of victims some of whom have suffered in silence for too long he said the messages are designed to help victims reach out and seek support it includes seven scenarios based on reallife experiences the scenario which has prompted debate on social media was one we thought very carefully about not all domestic abuse cases are the same and not all victims will want to leave or consider reporting to the policewe think it is positive that the campaign has sparked a debate on a very important issue katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said a campaign targeting older victims was welcome but the charity was extremely concerned about the message that a woman could stay safely in an abusive relationship studies showed that working with perpetrators could reduce physical violence but had only a limited effect in tackling coercive and controlling behaviour she said we believe that every woman deserves to live a life free from abuse however we understand that for many reasons some women are unable to leave an abusive partner she said the message that a woman can safely stay in a relationship that is or has been abusive is extremely dangerous it minimises the devastating impact of coercive control and could leave women stuck in an abusive relationship and feeling that there is nowhere to turn for help sandra horley the chief executive of the national domestic violence charity refuge said the campaign was misguided and dangerous it is the job of the police to arrest and charge domestic abuse perpetrators but only last month the third hmic report into the police response to domestic abuse victims found fewer perpetrators were being arrested as well as grave inadequacies in practice she said refuge supports abused women in the choices that they make but believes these choices should always be made with the benefit of specialist support from organisations like refuge that have decades of experience in understanding all forms of abuse including psychological being safe is not the end of the story it is just the beginning and skilled support to enable survivors to rebuild their lives is crucial,2017-12,essex police county council defended social medium campaign domestic

the first time women set foot in lambeth refuge some of them are still wearing pyjamas when you hear this it can take a few seconds for the penny to drop they are in pyjamas because fear has driven them to leave their homes in the middle of the night without stopping even to get dressed often they arrive with their children tania the manager of lambeth and other refuge services doesnt sugarcoat it they are fleeing in fear for their lives refuge has been helping domestic violence victims in lambeth for over a decade right now there are women and children housed across three locations it means theyre full to capacity for december as tania puts it a space is like gold dust look around and the staff have done all they can to create a welcoming place for christmas theres a special workshop for families to decorate cards together and safe places where the children here can play and make a mess without fear their mum will get hurt as punishment tania explains this is a time for family isnt it a woman has to be in dire fear to come here particularly at christmas ask her about the work the refuge does throughout the year and tania emphasises a space is more than just a safe bed for the night for an abuse victim its about building them back up the women come to lambeth from all over the country the central tenet is placing a woman where shes safe and she wont be found which means many find themselves in london with no possessions no support network and no knowledge of the area they are in each woman receives her own emergency toiletries as well as clothes to get her through theres a welcome pack to the area even local bus timetables everyone has a designated key worker to plan a future help with education or job searches and longterm safe accommodation and new schools for their children this all costs money and in a climate of squeezed council budgets its money thats being pulled fast since refuge has had cuts to of its services while the wider fabric of community safety nets childrens centres libraries or legal aid centres fall victim to austerity refuge figures show local authorities are reducing funding for domestic violence refuges on average by about for lambeth that shoots up to the size of the refuge network shelters spread across local authority areas means the national organisation can work to protect lambeth and ensure the women coming through the doors are still receiving the service they need but the another cut for the refuge could be round the corner thats the reality and a second devastating funding cut could soon be hitting refuge services under the governments proposed changes to refuge funding women fleeing domestic violence will no longer be allowed to pay for their accommodation with housing benefit a survey carried out by the charity womens aid last month found more than a third of refuges across england would subsequently have to shut their doors in effect locking women and children out of refuge protection when i ask what this would mean for refuge the response is brutal decimation of the sector already it is relying on charity to fill the gap the state has left christmas is a key time of year for fundraising as refuge tries to meet costs anything from emergency toiletry parcels to support for women taking their abusers to court or gifts for children at lambeth the refuge team works with local organisations to provide food gifts and a christmas dinner for everyone but tania stresses the funding drive is needed all year round domestic violence happens all day every day there are certain times of year when it becomes more poignant but theres always a need that need is palpable this week the independent using freedom of information requests painted a picture of growing domestic violence levels and a declining police response with forces across england now failing to attend one in nine domestic violence incidents the government is planning further culls to refuge provision and theres already insufficient space for women who are able to escape last month it emerged that every day about women and children fleeing domestic abuse are turned away in england under our noses refuges like lambeth are in effect being removed from the welfare system in this costcutting era a safe place for a woman fleeing for her life is somehow not an essential service the words tania utters to me are what motivates her to help the women spending christmas in the refuge but they could easily be a lesson for politicians we want them to know we care to support refuges work this christmas you can make a

some of the most vulnerable looked after children in the country are being failed by privately owned residential homes that are contracted to care for them it has been claimed undercover reporters

runs close to in covert filming for an itv documentary that airs tonight they found evidence of understaffing inadequate training and an admission by cambian employees that poorly performing homes are temporarily closed to avoid failing their ofsted inspection the documentary who cares childrens homes undercover also shows money being given to underage children to buy tobacco goading and public humiliation of a teenage boy and a physical intervention classified by a child protection expert as restraint which is played down and then recorded as a less serious form of intervention a school in shropshire run by cambian for lookedafter children attending its homes recently rated by ofsted as good is also reported to be in chaos one pupil repeatedly escapes on to a roof and a member of staff admits on camera that its awful i dont know why they even call it a school they dont do anything another employee says i dont think theyre learning anything here at the end of march this year there were more than children living in residential homes children are not placed in institutions except as a last resort so it is likely that for the majority of children in residential care multiple foster placements will already have broken down as a result of their early childhood experiences of neglect and abuse these young people often have complex needs and may require urgent therapeutic support however child psychologist professor tanya bryon commenting on one episode where a care worker publicly shames a yearold boy in a restaurant questions the training and expertise shown describing it as an example of everything you shouldnt do when working with vulnerable children residential care does not come cheap the filmmakers confirmed with cambian group that one home that employed their undercover reporter charges a week a keys home that features in the film charged a council a week meanwhile care staff are told to keep to tight budgets one worker quoted a day per

for cambian said until we see the programme we are unable to comment on it however the care of our children who are some of the most vulnerable in society is at the heart of everything that we stand

these claims we will act on any findings in conjunction with our regulator as a matter of urgency keys group said it had responded fully to the points raised with it by the programmemakers ofsted said it expects lookedafter children in residential homes to receive the highest standard of care as such we are naturally concerned about the allegations in the film it says it has recently inspected some of the settings involved and identified concerns which led to enforcement action being taken childrens homes are inspected frequently at least twice a year for those rated requires improvement or less

louise tickle importantly identifies the legal barriers to kinship carers receiving financial support family carers need our help december the statistics are stark in only of the children in kinship care were legally entitled to financial and professional support it is also of note that in england only of looked after children are placed with kinship carers compared to just under half in spain and there is also the injustice of opportunity arising from great variations between english local authorities research shows that kinship carers provide a strong family and cultural identity the child not seeing themselves as in care and they stick with them through troubled times even when lacking financial practical and personal support this evidence clearly suggests the urgent need for all kinship carers to receive legal recognition and resources as part of a continuum of preventative and care services for vulnerable children and their families professor mike stein university of york finally a call for financial support for kinship carers weve campaigned for years to end the discrimination that pays strangers for foster care but not grandparents who often have to fight to stop children being adopted but what about supporting mothers so children can stay with them women of whom are mothers suffer of austerity cuts including benefit sanctions which drive thousands to food banks of single parents overwhelmingly mothers with jobs live in poverty singlemother families are of the statutory homeless and nearly threequarters of families affected by the benefit cap section of the children act instructs local authorities to promote the upbringing of children by their families by providing accommodation and giving assistance in kind or in cash the care act entitles disabled mothers to extra help why are these entitlements rarely implemented the cut in early intervention highlighted by the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell is not the only reason an ideology of blaming mothers even for the domestic violence they suffer devaluing the childmother relationship regardless of its impact on children promoting forced adoptions and privatisation of children services has resulted in nearly children in care england and scotland in some workingclass areas of children are being referred to social services in ruling against a forced adoption the european court of human rights said that article respect for private and family life placed the state under a positive obligation to keep families together it blamed public and private services provided by saviours for child maltreatment and discrimination mothers and kinship carers picket londons family court every month demanding to be reunited with their children they ask when will they get the support they are legally entitled to nina lopez support not separation micheleine kane scottish kinship care alliance kim sparrow single mothers selfdefence i felt heartened by louise tickles piece it because it highlighted the situation for some children and their carers my wife and i are special guardians to our grandson who is seven he first came to us at christmas at six months old after being in care for five months at the age of five weeks he had suffered serious physical abuse by his father one of his injuries was almost impossible to imagine having one leg twisted until it snapped while many are quick to attack social services i have nothing but praise for the local social services they were helpful in any way they could be to us and were supportive throughout the process of obtaining special guardianship and after while acting as a kinship carer for two other toddlers beforehand i discovered that not all social services teams are as forthcoming naturally being a de facto new parent in advancing years is hard but i can honestly say that it has been the most rewarding time of my life i agree that more should be done to enhance the status of kinship carer and special guardians who do what they do not because of financial assistance or assistance in any form because in some cases there is none but because they are good people trying to do what is right for the child again thank you ms tickle and i really do mean it name and address supplied i agree with louise tickle that as an alternative to adoption the relatives of vulnerable children should be offered funding and practical help if they can provide a home for them the fact remains however that the twoparent family is still the bedrock of society and its most costeffective system of social care in the long term where

of the women killed by men in england wales and northern ireland last year died in their homes according to the femicide census an annual analysis by the charity womens aid nine in women killed during died at the hands of someone they knew of these women were killed by their current or former intimate partner three by their sons and five by another male family member nine were killed by a stranger womens aid said that the census revealed patterns in the killings many were committed in similar locations a sharp instrument was used as a weapon in cases more needs to be done to address mens fatal violence against women as once again the femicide census reveals fatalities not as isolated incidents but as part of a repeated pattern of male violence against women said katie ghose chief executive of womens aid shockingly in over twothirds of women killed by a man were killed by a current or former intimate partner of these women were killed at their own home or the home they shared with the perpetrator the government must urgently put the prevention of femicide at the centre of its work to combat male violence against women and girls women escaping domestic violence can be rehoused in refuges but ghose warned that the government was planning to remove supported housing funding for refuges placing women in greater jeopardy without a safe space to escape to more women will be killed by men that they know ghose said the government must act now refuges are a vital lifeline not an optional extra they are not just a bed for a night but essential for women and their children to safely escape domestic abuse and rebuild their lives away from the perpetrator a crucial part of preventing more fatalities must be to ensure sufficient provision for domestic abuse and sexual violence

the childrens services departments of more than councils in england are in special measures an observer analysis has revealed the survey comes amid claims that the child protection sector is experiencing a funding crisis similar to the one that engulfed adult social care two years ago of the record authorities currently under some form of intervention including birmingham buckinghamshire norfolk and tower hamlets are subject to statutory directions in which the education secretary legally requires an authority to take action the remainder which include manchester and surrey have been issued with improvement notices richard watts chair of the children and young people board of the local government association lga said across the sector there is basically no dispute that there is a larger number of councils struggling to cope than anyone is comfortable with pretty much every council in the country now considers childrens social care to be their biggest headache not adult social care a couple of years ago adult social care was under enormous pressure and the government found more money but now councils are saying that childrens social care is the biggest single funding pressure that local government faces at the moment a combination of rising demand and shrinking budgets has conspired to place childrens services under acute pressure since the baby p scandal in haringey in there has been an almost doubling of demand for childrens social care as councils adopt a more cautious approach to child protection there has also been a rise in the number of children who have joined gangs being cared for austerity too has proved a major factor families are really struggling at the moment there has been a noticeable increase in neglect cases and i think there is a link between that and the financial pressures that many families are under said watts some bn has been cut from budgets for childrens services since in addition to bn of cuts to early intervention funding anna feuchtwang chief executive of the national childrens bureau said there is a relentless squeeze on funding for childrens services and councils are seeing budgets dwindle at an alarming rate we need urgent investment to alleviate the mounting pressure on childrens services and a commitment from government that all children should get the right support at the right time andrew gwynne the shadow communities and local government secretary said we often discuss adult social care but the crisis facing childrens services poses an even greater threat to public services and to the financial sustainability of local authorities in the past seven years budget cuts have left councils with little option but to close family support services that are proven to spot and address the signs of neglect before emergency intervention is needed that an increasing number of councils are subject to intervention has become deeply contentious many local authorities believe that the framework for monitoring performance introduced in fails to recognise the complexities of child protection and is too quick to draw negative conclusions these concerns have prompted a rethink by the government which next month will roll out a new framework trialled in several pilot areas it appears to be a tacit acknowledgement of research commissioned by the lga which has shown that councils deemed inadequate often deteriorate rather than improve watts said inevitably good staff look elsewhere and it becomes more difficult to recruit theres often a leadership change at either a political or managerial level birminghams childrens services were rated inadequate in and have struggled to recover since the latest ofsted report published in october said that senior managers are aware that

when people think of gender equality they probably dont immediately think of snow but the small swedish city of karlskoga did just that when five years ago the city reviewed the way it cleared its streets officials realised that clearing the main highways first benefited car drivers more of whom tended to be men rather than footpaths and cycle paths more often used by women so the city decided to start by snowploughing the streets and paths around daycare centres then areas around the largest workplaces and schools before moving on to office districts and main roads the result genderneutral snow clearing with fewer injuries since pedestrians are more likely than motorists to be injured in icy weather thats just one example of what can happen when officials consider the impact of everyday policies on women sweden is the leader in this regard and not just when it comes to snowclearing the country has a feminist foreign policy and each year its budget is analysed by the swedish womens lobby to see how resources are divided and whether the government is living up to its promises on gender equality a recent oecd report the pursuit of gender equality an uphill battle outlines the size of the problem young women in oecd countries often now have more years in education than young men with of women in higher education compared to of men but women are still despite a narrowing employment gender gap less likely than men to have a job of men in oecd countries have a job compared to of women gender pay gaps widen with age as having a family usually has a negative impact on womens earnings and career prospects while the gender gap between childless men and women is that gap widens to between men and women with at least one child in the uk the gender pay gap between men and women is still at women are also less likely to be entrepreneurs and are underrepresented in private and public leadership positions the oecd wants gender to be central to policymaking or at the very least it wants countries to think about how policies will impact men and women differently its done a roundup of countries that are trying to do this in canada each federal department is responsible for incorporating the governments commitment to gender equality within its work progress is measured through a process called genderbased analysis plus in mexico the government has made it mandatory for all planning fiscal and budgeting legislation to consider gender mexico also systematically tags budget allocations for gender equality and makes this information available to the public allocations are tracked as they are approved modified and spent and this information is presented in quarterly reports and annual public accounts its something the uk has still to learn here we are seeing the impact of what happens when gender is not taken into account since the uk governments austerity policies including welfare cuts have impacted massively on women according to research by the house of commons library of funding cuts have come out of womens pockets as a result of tax and benefit changes such as a cap on housing benefit that means the cuts since will have cost women a total

labor has joined calls for all employees to get days paid domestic violence leave in line with a campaign from the australian council of trade unions bill shorten will announce on tuesday that if elected labor will legislate for days paid domestic and family violence leave in the national employment standards paid leave gives employees time off to meet legal medical counselling relocation and other administrative commitments to deal with or exit abusive or violent relationships the workplace entitlement would be available to all employees if they or an immediate family member experience family or domestic violence at the election labor promised five days of paid leave but the commitment to days brings it in line with the actu and the greens who promised last week to introduce a bill for days shorten said labor had upped its commitment because we recognise the need to improve workplace support for survivors of family violence weve listened to victims frontline workers business and organisations that deal daily with domestic violence he said their clear message is that people who have experienced domestic violence need more support in the workplace in women have been killed through domestic violence and it is the leading cause of death disability and illness among women aged to years of age the australian bureau of statistics estimates that around two out of every three women who experience domestic violence are in the workforce in a joint statement with the shadow minister for women tanya plibersek and shadow employment minister brendan oconnor shorten said that workers should not have the stress of seeking legal advice and medical treatment compounded by fear of losing your job or the financial disadvantage of going without pay labor accused the turnbull government of vacating the field because they do not support paid domestic violence leave they see domestic violence leave as a cost to business and in a terrifying display of how out of touch they are argue that it will make women less attractive to employers they said in july the fair work commission rejected the actus bid for days paid domestic violence leave to be included in all modern awards but left the door open to the possibility of unpaid leave employer organisations opposed the new entitlement the australian chamber of commerce and industry claimed it could cost employers as much as m to create just one day of domestic violence leave per worker per year unions dispute the figure and suggest the cost would be closer to m based on estimates that of female workers and less than of male workers take the leave each year when it is available to them labor said domestic violence leave would help businesses prevent loss of productivity and increases employee retention and reduces unpredictable absenteeism about m workers currently have access to paid family and domestic violence leave through enterprise bargaining or company policy labor acknowledged the many employers

time limits preventing victims of domestic violence from obtaining legal aid for court hearings will be scrapped from january the ministry of justice has announced the heavily criticised restrictions which have resulted in large numbers of women confronting abusive expartners without representation will also be relaxed to accept evidence from victim support organisations the changes deliver on signals that the system would be reformed given by the moj and revealed by the guardian earlier this year confirming the new guidelines for the legal aid agency the justice minister dominic raab said we have listened to victims groups and carefully reviewed the criteria for legal aid for victims of domestic abuse in family cases these changes make sure that vulnerable women and children get legal support so their voice is properly heard in court legal aid has usually been available to victims of domestic violence and child abuse or those deemed at risk as long as they could provide evidence of abuse within the past five years removal of the fiveyear limit and admission of fresh categories of evidence will help large numbers of women and some men who have been deprived of legal advice and representation in family court disputes over custody and contact with children the narrow evidence requirements were first imposed under the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders laspo act of the moj has launched a broader formal review of the impact of the legislation on access to justice the new regulations will be detailed in a statutory instrument put before parliament this week statements from domestic violence support organisations and housing support officers will in future be accepted as evidence of past abuse as well as those from social services law enforcement agencies and medical professionals earlier this year the government announced a m fund to support projects across the country to tackle violence against women and girls steve hynes the director of the legal action group who has campaigned against legal aid cuts welcomed the change its taken a long time because of the general election and other delays im very pleased they have made the announcement they realised its a priority it wasnt working women who experienced domestic violence were not qualifying for representation the amount of civil legal aid granted has fallen by since laspo was introduced elspeth thomson chair of the legal aid committee at the family law organisation resolution said weve been calling for changes to the evidence gateway since laspo was implemented in and welcome this news parliament has committed to protect victims of domestic abuse so ministers have a duty to ensure that those who need legal aid are able to access it these changes made in consultation with resolution and others are a step in the right direction allowing the justice system to better support atrisk and vulnerable people at perhaps the most difficult time of their lives when the family unit is breaking down ultimately these are real people not statistics and we must protect them and their access to the justice system estelle du boulay the director of the rights of women said the changes will make a significant difference to women experiencing or at risk of domestic abuse to access legal aid in private family law cases the previous system was so clearly unjust leaving many genuine survivors unable to access the legal aid they were entitled to because the evidence requirements were narrow onerous and unrealistic we fought the government through the courts to bring in these reforms we are particularly grateful to the many women survivors who provided testimony that enabled us to prove our case their voices have finally been listened to today cris mccurley a family law lawyer at the law firm ben hoare bell who has sat on the independent advisory group helping the moj throughout the review process said in spite of the un convention on the elimination of discrimination against women committee ruling that the uk government had to urgently review and ensure victims of violence would get legal aid for private family law proceedings in october these changes have only come about as a result of the hard work dedication and courage of rights of women in pursuing their case against the moj on domestic violence eligibility for legal aid all the way to the court of appeal the president of the law society of england and wales joe egan said legal aid is a lifeline for those who have suffered abuse it is often the only way someone can bring their case before the courts todays positive decision is the end result of work the law society and other organisations have been doing with the moj for many months sophie walker the leader of the womens equality party saidthe ministry of justices decision to lift these damaging restrictions on legal aid is welcome and long overdue too many women have been denied justice over the last seven years as a

the government has been cowed into clarifying the facts about its free childcare offer after a father complained to the advertising watchdog that the department for educations description was misleading the complaint centred on the governments marketing of the scheme as hours of free childcare a week implying it is available all year round in fact the hours entitlement is available for just weeks of the year a point the government only clarified on its childcarechoicesgovuk website after the advertising standards authority flagged concerns over the mans threeyearold son the clarification matters because children are only eligible for the scheme if both parents work and most working parents are not able to take weeks holiday a year the dfe also amended the website to clarify that nurseries and childminders are entitled to charge a fee for meals nappies and day trips many providers have started levying these and other charges since the introduction of the scheme as they claim the governments funding is inadequate leaving them with a shortfall the father who made the complaint to the asa who wished to remain anonymous said as my threeyearold son hopefully will learn there are weeks in a year however the scheme assumes there are only when the hours are stretched over a full year it only delivers about hours per week what is the government going to tell us next that its pledge to deliver a sevenday nhs was limited to the first weeks of the year he added that he thinks the governments website is still misleading on a wider point the free childcare pledge is not being delivered its galling that the government are still saying its free they are using taxpayers money to tell us lies neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance said at the root of this confusion is the governments unwillingness to admit that the true cost of free childcare can only be met by asking parents to foot the bill childcare providers are being forced to ask parents to effectively subsidise a service that has been advertised as free often by charging for goods and services previously offered for free or risk facing closure after meeting with childminders and nurseries some local authorities such as suffolk and east riding of yorkshire have already removed the word free from their marketing and publicity about the hours of entitlement other councils including bromley somerset and surrey already refer to it as a funded scheme the conservative party has been on the back foot since it rolled out the childcare scheme in september it has now said it will hold an independent evaluation of the implementation and impact of the beleaguered scheme it plans to publish the report next september the asa stopped short of taking formal action against the government after the dfe moved to resolve its concerns children and families minister robert goodwill said the childcare choices website helps parents understand what support they are eligible for it is routinely updated with additional information and resources for parents the advertising standards agencys response shows that the information available is sufficient for parents to make informed choices a dfe spokesperson later confirmed that the website had been updated directly in response to the concerns raised by the asa,2017-12,government ha cowed clarifying fact free childcare offer

the care of kids and i use this colloquial term deliberately for that is how i was taught to name children as a workingclass mum from yorkshire is debated ad nauseum the stats tell us there are a million more working mothers today than years ago we know mothers give the bulk of care to children at home but when the need to work arises and maternity and paternity leave have been exhausted they resort to a variety of providers statefunded or private nurseries creches andor relatives usually when childcare is discussed as a policy issue the attention is on cost with political parties competing to make it more affordable this it is often assumed will make them more popular with female voters the idea that both parents should be out at work and their children cared for by other people is rarely questioned this is as true on the left as on the right and as true of female politicians and commentators as it is of men not without good reason feminists fear that standing up for the idea that babies and young children should be cared for by their parents is a short step from forcing women out of the workplace yet many women and some men particularly those in lowpaid and unsatisfying jobs go out to work only reluctantly and in spite of the fact that they do not believe separation from their very young children to be in their best interests today as in the th century the main reason for many mothers going out to work is that male wages are too low to support a family yet history tells us that there is or once was another way during the industrial revolution mothers used the same childcare model they had in preindustrial times and worked with their babies and toddlers alongside them in my work as a historian i have discovered accounts by female mill workers of how they took their infants with them to the factory placing them at the side of the loom in a basket similarly female salt mine workers around manchester carried their infants to work and once there breastfed them and placed them down safely to sleep women nailmakers hung swings from the ceiling as soothers and used large egg cartons to make cots while birmingham buttonmakers used sawdust tubs for the same purpose for many women workers in the th century taking their babies to work was their legal and customary right this is not to idealise the victorian working environment which was harsh and dangerous the abolition of child labour in favour of education was one of a huge raft of measures that made th and stcentury workplaces easier and more safe but we can still learn from the example of the women workers who had no choice but to set about softening strengthening and shaping their workplaces around their maternal needs they domesticated workshops and mills by building makeshift cookshops as they needed to eat in order to produce enough breast milk and employed girls to run errands and clean for them some of these women were also topclass trade unionists in an allfemale strike committee the dewsbury and batley heavy woollen weavers association successfully opposed a wage cut put to workers and their families in mills women trade unionists did not suddenly emerge for the match girls strike or indeed to become the dagenham girls years later unfortunately these innovative childcare practices were outlawed after in favour of the male breadwinning wage this meant that men had the sole responsibility of providing for their families a political choice enshrined by david lloyd georges welfare state reform in via male unemployment insurance i say unfortunately in part because the hopes built upon the male breadwinning wage that it could provide for families on its own were vastly overplayed the consequence was millions more families in poverty and a situation that continues today in which if the mother of a baby or small child wants to help boost her familys earnings she must effectively split her wage with a carer of course punishing poor women is nothing new under the cruel thcentury poor law mothers had to pass their children over to a nurse upon entry to the workhouse the economic difficulty facing single mothers is legendary and forced many thousands into lifetimes of pain in the last century when they were forced to give their babies up for adoption even today single mothers disproportionately bear the scrounger label as do some married mothers who have to rely on state benefits because they cant take their babies to work ten years ago the parenting in the workplace institute was founded in the us with the aim of providing resources for a growing number of employers allowing new parents to bring babies to work currently it suggests there are around companies with such programmes who have between them hosted babies usually for the first six months of life typically parents who join such schemes are able to interact with their babies at all times while their workplaces have designated rooms for changing and feeding in the uk our much stronger parental leave entitlements mean such arrangements are arguably less urgently needed particularly by professionals who can afford to take time off but many others cannot afford to take full advantage of their leave entitlements meanwhile thousands of home workers are already combining paid work with parenting in many small familyowned businesses such as local shops having children around playing behind the counter or helping out has long been the norm nannies and childminders too sometimes combine looking after their own children with the paid work of looking after other peoples extending such working patterns to other professional settings wont appeal to everyone and in places such as hospitals or building sites it would clearly be unsafe but the idea that taking a baby or young toddler to work might be one of a menu of options would provide further choice for parents facing difficult decisions and reduced incomes in the first year of a childs life ask yourself if it would really be so difficult to buy a frock from a shop assistant with a baby in her arms or sleeping in a swing or sling would this stymie anyones sales technique perhaps we should be shocked to see a new mother in a shop without her baby rather than with it wider acceptance of breastfeeding in public places is arguably a first step towards more childfriendly workplaces to get any further down this road will take committed campaigning and backing from unions mps and feminist groups but we can find succour in womens history which reminds us that in the th century some working women found ways to combine employment and motherhood that i believe meant they had more rights and independence in respect of childcare than many women do today melanie reynolds
