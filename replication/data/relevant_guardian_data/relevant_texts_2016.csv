thousands of families have started receiving official letters telling them they need to set up a pension plan for their nanny during the next few months many of those receiving the act now letters from the pensions regulator probably dont think of themselves as employers and will feel daunted by the prospect of having to set up a staff pension scheme for their nanny both the employer and the nanny will have to contribute to this pension calculations done for guardian money suggest that by the amount a typical family is required to pay in could easily be a year with the nanny having to pay in perhaps of her or his annual pay those receiving the letters are being warned they must comply with their new legal duties or risk a fine of and then a day families who employ a nanny are the latest category of employer to be affected by automatic enrolment a shakeup of retirement saving designed to get millions more people paying into a pension auto enrolment went live in late and requires all employers to automatically enrol eligible workers into a workplace pension where both the worker and their employer pay some money in big companies such as supermarkets were the first to sign up now the focus has switched to the millions of small and micro employers such as those who employ someone like a nanny or personal care assistant employers must automatically enrol any employee who on the date the law applies to them is at least years old but below state pension age earns more than a minimum amount currently a year which is the same as gross earnings of a month and is not in a workplace pension scheme those who employ a nanny or carer will typically receive a letter from the pensions regulator months before the date that the law applies to them this is called their staging date sarah rogers who lives in south london with her husband and two children aged seven and three employs a nannyhousekeeper for hours a week she pays the nanny who lives out an hour after tax and national insurance rogers received a letter earlier this month informing her that her staging date is february that date might be a year away but the regulator says employers should start planning months before their duties start and choose a pension scheme around six months before rogers says i dont mind paying into a scheme for my nanny as i think its important that everyone benefits from a pension when they retire but on a practical level trying to balance a job and two small kids it does feel like just another paperwork headache she is planning to enrol her nanny into nest national employment savings trust the giant workplace pension scheme set up by the government so how much might rogers and her nanny have to pay into the pension under automatic enrolment the total minimum amount paid in is currently of qualifying earnings typically made up of from the worker from their employer and in tax relief from the government rising to in april typically from the worker from their employer and in tax relief and then in april typically from the worker from their employer and in tax relief just to complicate matters further these percentages dont apply to all of an individual workers salary only to their qualifying earnings which is what they earn over a minimum amount currently a year and up to a maximum amount currently a year the nannys net wage of a week translates into a gross wage takehome pay plus tax and national insurance of a year we asked nest to calculate how much would need to be paid into her pension it told us that the employer contribution would start at around a year rising to a year from april and then a year from april onwards over the same period the nannys contributions would start at around a year rising to and then to the tax relief from the government would start at around a year rising to and then payroll companies are targeting those affected by this and are offering to help those with nannies to comply with their pension duties in return for a fee of typically a year karen kemp at waypaye says a lot of clients dont class themselves as employers its childcare we had one who said im not doing that she made her nanny redundant and put her child into nursery asked about the fee her firm charges kemp didnt wish to disclose it but says there is quite a lot of work involved as well as calculating pension payments the firm takes care of other jobs such as completing the declaration of compliance which confirms someone has met their legal duties with the pensions regulator the law sets out various employer obligations for example they must write to their employees within six weeks after their staging date to explain how automatic enrolment applies to them and must declare their compliance within five months after that date helen dean nests chief executive says if you employ a nanny you may have to enrol them in a pension soon youll be helping them build up a nest egg for their future but we know the idea of setting up a pension scheme can sound daunting luckily it doesnt have to be difficult you can set yourself up really easily online with nest or use a payroll package that will do the admin for you workers can opt out of automatic enrolment ie say no to being put into a pension scheme but they cant opt out until after they have been enrolled and they have to do all the

thousands of kinship carers adults who step in to look after the children of relatives to prevent them being taken into care will be exempted from controversial twochild benefit limits after a government uturn ministers announced in the house of lords that they were now in favour of exempting kinship carers and parents who adopt sibling groups from their plans to limit the child tax credit to the first two children from april the government backed down after warnings that the twochild benefits policy would deter potential kinship carers from coming forward resulting in increasing numbers of children being placed in the care system however welfare reform minister david freud said bereaved parents and families fleeing domestic violence will continue to be covered by the cap on child tax credits the shadow work and pensions minister maeve sherlock said these were important concessions that would make a huge difference to very vulnerable children she said having resisted

children through the care system to exceed m family rights group said that the prospect of being forced into poverty and debt would deter potential kinship carers from taking on children it is unclear whether kinship carers will be exempted from the benefit cap which will limit total benefits claimable by unemployed workingage households to or a week or in london plunging many of those affected

linguists call it collocation the likelihood of two words occurring together if i say pop your mental rolodex will begin whirring away coming up with candidates for what might follow music song or star are highly likely sensation or diva a little less so snorkel very unlikely indeed what do you think of when i say the word rabid one option according to the dictionary publisher oxford dictionaries is feminist the publisher has been criticised for a sexist bias in its illustrations of how certain words are used nagging is followed by wife grating and shrill appear in sentences describing womens voices not mens one of the points of oxford dictionaries part of oxford university press oup is to show how words are used in the real world and that is their response to allegations of sexism the example sentences we use are taken from a huge variety of different sources and do not represent the views or opinions of oxford university press they said in a statement in other words its not the dictionary thats sexist its the englishspeaking world why choose feminist over say rightwinger communist or fan though as if not quite convinced by its own explanation the oup is now reviewing the example sentence for rabid to ensure that it reflects current usage that can only be a good thing but a word of warning it might not deliver the answer youd hope for perhaps rabid is collocated with feminist more often than with those other words if the data the oup uses includes online discussions i wouldnt be surprised if this was the case sexist assumptions find their way into speech and writing for the simple reason that society is still sexist language as the medium through which we conduct almost all relationships public and private bears the precise imprint of our cultural attitudes the history of language then is like a fossil record of how those attitudes have evolved or how stubbornly they have stayed the same when it comes to women the message is a depressing one the denigration of half of the population has embedded itself in the language in ways you may not even be aware of often this takes the form of pejoration when the meaning of the word gets worse over time linguists have long observed that words referring to women undergo this process more often than those referring to men here are eight examples mistress the female equivalent of master and thus a woman having control or authority in particular one who employs servants or attendants it came into english with this meaning from french after the norman conquest from the th century onwards it was used to mean a woman other than his wife with whom a man has a longlasting sexual relationship hussy this once neutral term meant the female head of a household hussy is a contraction of thcentury husewif a word cognate with modern housewife from the th century onwards however it began to mean a disreputable woman of improper behaviour thats now its only meaning madam the female equivalent of sir a woman of high rank is still used in formal contexts as a mode of address from the late th century it was also used to mean a conceited or precocious girl or young woman a hussy a minx alternatively a kept mistress or prostitute and finally from the late th century the female manager of a brothel governess from the th century onwards a woman who holds or exercises authority over a place institution or group of people compare it with governor over time it drastically narrowed in scope and fell in status coming to mean a woman responsible for the care supervision or direction of a person typically a child or young lady spinster this occupational term originally meant simply someone usually a woman but possibly a man who spun yarn or thread since a woman without a husband might have to rely on spinning as a source of income the term became associated with unmarried women eventually becoming the legal way to refer to one the more loaded use of it to refer to a woman still unmarried esp one beyond the usual age for marriage an old maid begins in the early th century courtesan one of the most dramatic shifts in meaning from the female equivalent of courtier someone who attends the court of a monarch to a form of prostitute which is now its only meaning wench a thcentury word meaning a female infant or a young unmarried woman quickly acquired negative connotations from the late th century in langland and chaucer it is used to mean a wanton woman a mistress tart collins dictionary says that this is a thcentury contraction of sweetheart a term of endearment particularly to women from however it is attested as meaning a female of immoral character a prostitute thinking about the male equivalents of some of these words throws their sexism into sharp relief master for mistress sir for madam governor for governess bachelor for spinster courtier for courtesan whereas the male list speaks of power and high status the female list has a very different set of connotations these are of either subordinate status or sexual service to men the crucial thing to remember is that at one time they were simply equivalents these eight words show how social conditions leave their mark on the language the process of pejoration may take place below the level of consciousness but in historical perspective the direction of travel is obvious have the achievements of the feminist movement percolated down through the many layers of our language the oxford dictionaries controversy suggests not can the words we use to describe women avoid the fate of hussy mistress and courtesan theres hope but only time will tell,2016-01,linguist call collocation likelihood two word occurring together say pop mental rolodex begin whirring away coming

when her daughter turned five in november alexa clarke couldnt afford to celebrate nor could she afford to heat her house put healthy food on the table or buy her daughter new shoes for school the fiveyearolds birthday had seen clarkes benefits halted and her transition on to universal credit uc the governments flagship welfare reform that rolls six benefit payments currently paid weekly or fortnightly into one monthly lump sum it took seven weeks for clarkes first uc to arrive and she had only an advance of which she had requested as an emergency interestfree loan to live on as the bills piled up i was scared to even pick my daughter up from school sometimes because i felt like i was failing her says clarke whose name was changed for this story everyone else was carrying christmas shopping and i couldnt even keep my house warm tameside in greater manchester was the first local authority to initiate the welfare reform programme in clarke had been living on weekly and fortnightly benefit payments since her daughter was born before being moved on to uc last year she had never missed a rent payment and had mastered the art of budgeting her benefits but just as her daughter started school and clarke began applying for restaurant jobs everything fell apart in the wait for initial payment the heating shut off then the electricity failed clarkes phone credit ran out and she had no choice but to approach a nearby foodbank at the same time an adviser at tamesides jobcentre plus insisted she spend hours each week looking for work or risk sanctions a condition of the new uc clarke couldnt even afford the bus fare she needed to hand out her cv to local restaurants in may uc will extend to all new claimants of jobseekers allowance employment and support allowance income support housing benefit working tax credit and child tax credit it is currently paid to more than claimants who are registered at jobcentres across the uk and full transition is scheduled for completion by the government says uc will encourage personal budgeting improve incentives to work and respond flexibly to the transition into work but research by citizens advice bureaux and social housing landlords has found that the wait for initial payment usually five or six weeks can throw claimants like clarke into shortterm crisis that often spirals into longterm debt sixteen citizens advice branches found that up to june almost of their clients on uc had waited more than seven weeks for the first payment when the money arrives the bills get paid but the debt continues to take its toll when clarkes first cheque for arrived on january a monthly sum of had been skimmed off as a partial payment for the advance she had received she owed in rent so she handed over to her social landlord a recovery proceedings letter from tameside council had arrived in the post too she had missed council tax payments and it threatened to take her to court its like its set up for you to fail clarke says i want to get into work but they now want me to spend money searching for jobs within minutes of home for hours each week when theyve deducted my money and im worse off than ever when im in arrears nigel morgan the chief executive of the tameside citizens advice bureau says that since the expansion of uc in the area rent arrears and other forms of debt have snowballed people are borrowing money to cover shortterm losses and then struggling to pay it back he says and anecdotally loan sharks are hitting the most vulnerable people when the national federation of almos nfa surveyed its members who manage more than council homes across england on arrears in october and november last year the policy director chloe fletcher had to doublecheck the figures they showed that of uc claimants in social housing had fallen into rent arrears compared with of all social tenants in my time researching rent arrears ive never seen figures like that for a cohort of tenants says fletcher she has worked in housing policy for years the arrears often plague tenants for months or even years and they also pose an extra burden on social landlords and housing associations new charter group clarkes social landlord found that tenants on uc have seen arrears grow on average since they transitioned onto uc new charter also estimates that once universal credit is rolled out to all its eligible tenants it could see a increase in overall debt fletcher says that the financial stress of these arrears could mean cuts to new building plans repair and maintenance services or tenant support work in sutton south london where a small digital pilot of universal credit is now under way the councils social landlord is trying to mitigate major arrears it tracks tenants who are moving on to uc identifying those with a history of late payments and advising them to request that housing fees be paid direct to the landlord upfront in this setup the claimants also forfeit of their remaining monthly allowance to gradually pay landlords back for existing arrears while monica prempeh was waiting for her first uc payment in sutton she borrowed cash from each of her three daughters she was already late on her rent payments and she would now miss council tax gas and electric bills too she needed to use a baffling computer service to search for jobs and log her hours but she barely understood it the stress debilitated her and for days at a time she couldnt leave the house her doctor wrote her a prescription for antianxiety medication it wasnt until paul vandi the income manager at sutton housing partnership told her not to fear eviction that she began to relax together they submitted a request to the dwp to redirect housing payments and an additional small monthly arrears payment to shp once they had scheduled an automated payment on her debt suttons social landlord had no reason to take her to court vandi for one sees this as the silver lining to uc the wait for the initial payment is a problem he admits but tenants who set up rent and payback plans for landlords are protected from eviction even if they live on tighter budgets in the meantime but for most the glint of a silver lining is barely visible before uc housing benefit automatically transferred to social landlords and a tiny sum for rent arrears could too now tenants like prempeh have to jump through extra hoops before they can set up the same arrangement and intensive support from staff like vandi wont be possible once uc expands to hundreds of thousands of new claimants citizens advice staff and housing providers agree that the initial payment delay has emerged as the major stumbling block in ucs implementation withholding payment for at least five weeks rests on a faulty assumption that claimants have last months money in the bank but benefit claimants lived on money coming in weekly and fortnightly and only half of lowincome workers in britain receive earnings monthly stunned by the figures on rent arrears fletcher and her team at the nfa are pushing for a policy change that expedites that first uc payment to protect tenants from longterm debt and landlords from a loss of income a spokesman for the dwp challenges the research findings and says there is no evidence of systemic delays in payments for anyone who is having difficulties we provide budgeting help and benefit advances as well as stronger support for vulnerable people he says and under universal credit claimants are more likely to move into work and earn more in tameside clarke wonders how any parent can withstand even the standard wait for uc it nearly broke me she says who can ask a mother to go without income for seven weeks when her child needs clothes and food clarke can finally afford the bare necessities but paying off her debt to her landlord the council and the friends and relatives who helped her with christmas has only just begun,2016-01,daughter turned five november

the governments main childcare policies are fragmented uneven and failing to deliver for families in poverty according to a new report the study by the family and childcare trust fact says that from next year bn of public funding which constitutes of gdp will be allocated to childcare spending yet evidence shows that lowincome families are still losing out it calls on the government to come up with a year strategy to transform childcare services with the focus on delivering high quality childcare to the most deprived families the comprehensive report entitled creating an antipoverty childcare system and funded by the joseph rowntree foundation says children at risk of poverty rarely have consistent access to high quality early years care despite evidence that this improves outcomes it also says the system of support with childcare costs is bureaucratic and difficult for parents to navigate and fails to adequately support them in training or education both of which would provide a route out of poverty one of the governments key election pledges was to extend free childcare to hours a week for three and fouryearolds but according to the report under the current system half of the most disadvantaged twoyearolds do not receive their free entitlement to childcare in a setting led by an early years graduate a key quality indicator and it calls for a better qualified early years workforce to be paid in line with school staff who currently earn more the reports authors also say a simplified funding system would help focus efforts on improving poorer childrens outcomes and propose that more of the state subsidy should be paid direct to service providers as a means of delivering access to high quality childcare regardless of parents ability to pay julia margo the fact chief executive said while government initiatives such as extended free hours and taxfree childcare were welcome the government risked making an already complex system more complex and would leave gaps in vital support for low income families our ambitious proposal for a simplified funding system could tackle many of the barriers low income families experience when they try to access childcare and help them move into work evidence shows that sufficient funding for a high quality childcare system brings fiscal benefits in the longer term through childrens attainment increased maternal employment higher tax intake and lower welfare payments helen barnard head of analysis at the joseph rowntree foundation said investing in early intervention and family support services linked to childcare providers helps families give children a good start in life changing the way that childcare is subsidised will help to remove many of the barriers that lowincome families face when trying to access childcare we also need to look at ways to boost the quality of care to make sure that the system works for those on the lowest incomes neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance added as the report rightly highlights high quality childcare and education has been shown to be particularly beneficial for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds and has the power to improve outcomes for the most vulnerable in society however as we have always said quality costs and the only way we will be able to achieve the laudable aims of this report is if the government is willing to invest what is needed into the early years sector leitch said research had shown that the early years sector was already significantly underfunded its vital therefore that the government adequately funds its promise to extend the free early education offer to hours per week for three and fouryear olds if it does not this is a very real risk of a decline in the availability of high quality care for those who need it most davina ludlow director of the online guide daynurseriescouk said as the report highlights early years providers play such an important role in the education and development of young children but many do not receive the support they need this means that many families miss out on these critical services it is vital that the government continues to invest in the sector local authorities need to be given the appropriate levels of funding first this will not only allow them to assess the levels of childcare provision but will ensure the system remains sustainable easing the burden on hardworking families the fact report concludes with this message to government despite the progress that has been made in the last two decades the uk childcare system continues to represent an unfulfilled opportunity the uk is in a strong position the basis of a worldclass childcare system is already in place policymakers should grasp the opportunity to translate the potential of this system into reality,2016-01,government main childcare policy fragmented uneven failing deliver family poverty according new report study family childcare

for the or so women employed in the uk civil service there was some good news last week recent concerted efforts to increase the number of senior women in central government have paid off civil servants of any gender can be proud that they work for the organisation with the highest number of female senior officials in europe and the fourthhighest of the g countries compiled by consultants ey the most recent index of female officials in senior central government posts shows canada comfortably in the lead when it comes to promoting women to its most senior posts but the index also shows that there is not a single g country where of top government posts are held by women even in canada with a longstanding programme of affirmative action there is still not an equal gender balance in top government jobs of senior officials in canada are women of the g nations the eu in the form of the european commission and the european central bank takes up the other g place australia comes second with then south africa with almost the striking thing about the list is that the uk has made it to fourth place despite the fact that less than of our most senior civil servants are women since women make up over half of the total civil service workforce this shows how quickly the numbers drop off at the top levels of the european countries italy comes second after the uk with of women in senior government jobs putting it in eighth place in the g france and germany are lagging coming in th and th respectively but eys head of government and public sector bjrn conway says our european neighbours are catching up fast according to conway some european countries such as france and germany have introduced policies to address the gender pay gap and increase female representation the uk government needs to maintain momentum in increasing the gender diversity of its senior management he says and in closing the pay gap on average women in uk central government departments are paid less than men doing equivalent jobs theres only one department environment food and rural affairs defra where women are on average paid more than men its perhaps surprising that the biggest pay gap is in one of whitehalls newer departments the department for energy and climate change where women at the departments senior grades are paid on average less than their male counterparts its not just on pay where there are big differences between central government departments eys report highlights as many commentators have been saying for the past five years the worrying ease with which progress can be lost both the home office and the department for education have slipped back since that year the dfe had more women than men in its senior team but the figure has now fallen to only two departments

with childcare costs rocketing many parents rely heavily on grandparents so they can continue working figures from the family and childcare trust show that sending a child under two to nursery parttime hours costs a week in the uk or a year thats a rise since and in london it can be much higher it is beyond the reach of many families which is why parents are reaching out to grandparents in a bid to make childcare more affordable says the trusts jill rutter insurer rias says grandparents spend an average of nine hours a week looking after grandchildren which saves parents a year in childcare fees david finch senior economic analyst for the resolution foundation a thinktank which focuses on people on low to middle incomes agrees that formal childcare can be prohibitively expensive for less welloff families and can even act as a disincentive to work the extra nursery hours needed when working more can leave them keeping just six pence of every additional pound earned or possibly worse off despite the support through tax credits dr lucy peake from grandparents plus adds grandparents are throwing a lifeline to families squeezed by falling incomes and rising childcare costs the contribution they are making within their families and the wider economy is enormous and rising but caroline abrahams charity director from age uk warns looking after young children can be exhausting its important that grandparents are comfortable with the demands placed on them and that they are not putting their health at risk by taking on too much however there are also concerns about the older generation being expected to work longer themselves while caring more for grandchildren the financial implications of taking on formal regular childcare responsibilities need to be considered as the state pension age is pushed back abrahams says it may become increasingly difficult for grandparents to continue providing such invaluable support in a positive step the government announced plans in october to give working grandparents the right to take time off to help care for grandchildren the current system of shared parental leave will be extended to cover them during the first year of a childs life recent research from ipsos mori found that almost two million grandparents have either given up a job reduced their hours or taken time off to look after grandchildren under the new rules parents will be able to share up to weeks leave and up to weeks parental pay currently a week or of average earnings with a nominated working grandparent for example mothers could choose to take the first seven months off with the child themselves the father could take the next two months and finally the grandmother could take three months off while the move has been widely welcomed along with the introduction of greater choice for families about balancing childcare and work campaigners say the plans do not go far enough findings from grandparents plus show that help from the older generation stretches way beyond the first year of a childs life with one in four working families depending on their help while their children grow up especially during infancy and the primary school years the charity also found that two million parents would give up work if grandparents were unable to provide childcare we need to take action to enable grandparents to combine work and care peake says giving grandparents the right to flexible working and entitlement to leave to care for grandchildren as they grow up would make a huge difference to families and the economy deborah aspin who lives in bolton with her husband philip has reduced her hours to help care for four grandchildren under the age of five i help my daughter laura and her husband by providing two full days a week for lucas three and joshua two says aspin this recently dropped from three days as the boys are now going to nursery they live just down the road so its easy to be on hand she also helps out her son nathan and his partner leah as and when needed with their monthold daughter faith and nathans stepson noah five this can sometimes be a bit ad hoc due to the nature of their working hours she adds aspin works as an hr and office manager two days a week i used to work fulltime before laura had lucas but i cut my hours when i realised i could provide real assistance she says laura is a hairdresser and paul works for a car company but with a young family to pay for and a mortgage to cover money is tight as i dropped my hours by half this has meant a pay cut plus i now face extra costs such as food and treats but philip and i have made changes to our lives to accommodate this it can be hard work at times and i sometimes think that coming into the office is a day off but i just get on with it knowing that the children wont be young for ever i want to make sure i enjoy these years while i can philip a retired policeman now runs his own business from home i love watching him spend time with the grandchildren as he was working fulltime when our children were young says aspin we both play a big role in our grandchildrens lives i may eventually take on more days at work when the children get a bit older but for now we just adore spending time with them in hackney east london yearold john pipal sets one day aside each week as grandparent day his eldest son joe and his partner ruanna have three children alice six sylvia three and sixmonthold samuel his stepdaughter billie has clelia four it varies from week to week how many grandchildren i have on my grandparent day says pipal who spends three days a week working as a computer consultant for a number of voluntary organisations sometimes i have just one little one and on other occasions my wife lisa and i have three between us i look forward to caring for them each week childcare is certainly tiring but some aspects seem easier than when i was a parent now that im older i have more time to focus on the children rather than trying to juggle several things at once as i did when i was worried about my career helping out does have financial benefits for the parents and also gives them space to do other things and to get on with their working lives this help is particularly important to billie who is a single parent and works from home before clelia started school it was quite a struggle for her to do a job so lisa and i were able to help ease the pressure care options to consider dont assume that nursery is the only option when it comes to childcare childminders can be more costeffective and the hours they offer more flexible nannies are another option and can work especially well if you and your friends are in the same scenario you could consider nannysharing to bring down the cost for more information visit nannysharecouk consider organising a childcare swap where you share duties with a friend whose working hours complement yours with this arrangement you look after your friends children while they are at work and they return the favour when you are at work agree on hours and schedules at the outset also work out what will happen in terms of illness and taking holidays look into options such as community nurseries which are run on a notforprofit basis there may be a waiting list but costs can be a lot cheaper than a private nursery ask your employer about flexible work options or job sharing get as much help as you can from friends and family tired but reaping the rewards leonard baines is a very handson grandfather who helps his daughter zoe and soninlaw with their two children in the mornings two or three days a week and also after school from time to time zoe works fulltime in the charity sector and leaves for work each day at am her husband frances nyeko is doing a nursing degree at university college hospital in london and also leaves early leonard from watford in hertfordshire usually arrives just before am and helps out with the morning routine for sixyearold maimie and fouryearold tyla generally the girls are up and dressed and having breakfast by the time i arrive says leonard but if not i start with this and then play

finance manager it can be quite tiring but ive got used to it he says i find it very rewarding spending time with the girls i couldnt do five days a week but this way makes a big difference leonards

ritualised brutality vengeful blood lust vicious savagery justified by medieval notions of retribution we all know how dark the world can be these days a world where men are garrotted and impaled where theyre speared and disembowelled and have their necks slashed and their genitals sliced off where theyre killed for no other reason than revenge this isnt raqqa though its the revenant the hottest blockbuster of the season winner of three golden globes a week ago nominated for oscars last thursday and yours for around this weekend at your local multiplex its a tale of revenge retribution and primal violence according to the guardians peter bradshaw as thrilling and painful as a sheet of ice held to the skin this is praise by the way its unthinkingly aggressively masculine says gq thats praise too the film is based on a true story of the american frontier from and ill summarise the plot for you man seeks revenge man gets revenge thats it basically for two and a half hours though there is a brief reprieve when you get to see leonardo dicaprio being mauled by a grizzly bear early reports suggested that he was raped but no thats a fate reserved for one of the two women who appear fleetingly on screen the other one is slaughtered but dont worry you have no idea who she is so you wont actually care the woman is not actually raped of course shes faux raped because this is what we call acting and because the revenant is what we call entertainment theres a crucial difference between us and the people we are currently trying to blow to smithereens with millionpound missiles we choose to pay to watch women being pretend raped rather than watching women being actually raped for free i wasnt entertained can you tell i saw it at a press screening two weeks before christmas when the streets were filled with twinkly fairy lights and i tripped past a salvation army band playing silent night to spend what felt like several weeks in a dark room waiting oh dear god do you wait for leo to just get on and hack the other man to death so i could finally go home a welloiled publicity machine of the type that fuels an academy awards clean sweep has carefully leaked how gruelling the shoot was how authentically the actors suffered in the making they got a bit cold apparently and emmanuel lubezkis cinematography all shot in just a few hours of natural light each day really is gorgeous director alejandro gonzlez irritus idea was for it to look as real as possible which would have been magnificent if there was something in the way of a story or any meditation on the nature of retribution or anyone anyone that you could give one toss about but theres not so the landscape is chilling and the violence is pointless and the whole thing is meaningless a vacuous revenge tale that is simply pain as spectacle the revenant is pain porn and in all probability it will win every oscar going critics have lavishly praised its visceral imagery its authentic feel it is they say immersive filmmaking at its finest though arguably not as immersive as putting a camera in a cage and then setting a man on fire have you seen that one where the man is burned alive its not by gonzlez irritu but isis it wasnt nominated for anything but the pain is even more real more visceral more what was the word thrilling than dicaprios but then all of isiss video output is inspired by our own entertainments in its subject matter its soundtrack its editing islamic state hasnt invented new narrative tropes its simply lifted them straight from hollywood all its done is to go one step further trumped hollywood at its own game it has seen what we want what we thrill to and given it to us if there were grizzly bears in the syrian desert theres no doubt that theyd put one in a cage and let us see what it really looks like when one rips a man apart the revenant isnt responsible for this its simply the kind of tedious emotionally vacant film that has certain critics and academy award judges wetting their pants dont pay you might as well wait for it to come out on netflix and fall asleep on your own sofa or stay awake and enjoy the raping and somebody or other getting a machete in the head just for the hell of it or just wait for the next isis offering your choice though perhaps we could all try and act a little less surprised by the islamic states next video spectacular or ask ourselves why pain and suffering and brutalising women and pointless fetishistic violence when its done by hollywood wins awards or why were so keen for it to look real what neurotransmitters are we releasing what thirst are we slaking isiss films are simply the next logical step of our films their culture is actually our culture too isis hasnt invented any of this it is just a bit more honest about it more authentic more visceral more real,2016-01,ritualised brutality vengeful blood lust vicious savagery justified medieval notion retribution know

i am a yearold european girl i came to the uk to study and at university i met my partner who also came to study from abroad he is south asian and muslim whereas i am christian we have been together for over five years without my parents knowledge because i knew their reaction would be very bad after we graduated and got settled with brilliant jobs i started the process of telling my mum about him she is opposed to him due to his race colour and religion and she has become very abusive and threatening she feels hurt calls me selfish and without ever meeting him calls us unspeakable names and says she has no appetite for mixedrace grandchildren i explained that this was why i could not discuss my relationship with her and had to become independent in order to speak to her when they do not get their way my parents just mention the financial help they have given me now she is threatening to tell my dad and says they will come to pick me up from the uk and cut their financial support however i do not need her money and have not used it for three years i am very insulted but i want my parents in my life my mother though is very toxic drives me to tears and i am afraid my dad will be even worse as he is even more narrowminded my partner and i have thought about and discussed the difficulty of having a family together we have also sought legal help and drafted prenups so our parents will feel more at ease i am very sad about this behaviour i feel that my mum is knowingly abusive and hurtful in order to manipulate me and make me feel even more guilty this must be a very hard time for you you have left home moved countries studied got a job and you are happy in love yet your parents dont see any of what would make most parents proud instead they are defining you by their bigoted beliefs no wonder you are sad the disappointment must be extreme the good news is that your mum cannot just come and pick you up you are not on a playdate and you are not beholden to them financially those are all pluses so you are physically independent and safe but emotionally i can see how tied and conflicted you feel it must be awful to feel that your parents will only love you if you do what they say i was intrigued to know what sort of legal help and prenup arrangements you thought you needed to help your parents his too it seems feel more at ease especially as prenups arent anyway legally binding i consulted myira khan bacpcouk who specialises in relationship and family problems and the first thing she picked up on was you seem to have very little power in your relationship with your mother you are also still trying to appease your parents with these prenups they dont seem to be for you yourselves your mum does seem to have a lot of control and when controlling people start to lose that power they get desperate the big hook she has you dangling from seems to be that you are scared of an ultimatum your partner or them your mum also seems to have power over you about telling your dad so you really need to tell him first to defuse that little time bomb but as khan says if your parents give you an ultimatum you still have a choice and ability not to cut them off you can say i choose him but i am not cutting you off dont blame me in other words if they cut you off it is their choice not yours and they will need to take responsibility for it you are as khan says only responsible for your half of the relationship with your parents you cannot live a life dictated by them fearful of doing something they wont like in case they go mad or cut you off because where will it end they may never like who you choose controlling people whether parents or partners dont like displays of autonomy have your parents always made your choices for you that is not parenting khan wants you to think about how youd like your relationship with your mum to develop and if you could ask her what her concerns her fears actually are or is all sensible discussion out of the window what you want the freedom to choose who you love and to live your life and keep your parents in your life without condemnation may not be possible just yet i live in hope however that although their reaction right now may be extreme people do change if they dont that is their choice just as what you do next should be yours your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri

feminists rejoiced this week at the news that politics alevel will give all students the opportunity to study the core ideas of feminism or rather we wearily celebrated yet another hard fought win that really should have happened automatically but like police campaigns that dont blame the victim and funding for rape crisis services the inclusion of feminism on the political syllabus was apparently something we still had to battle for in fortunately the battle was won thanks largely to a petition launched by teenager june ericudorie and pressure from the wider feminist movement ministers have so far remained tightlipped about the exact content of the syllabus though schools minister nick gibb said in a commons debate the final content will set out clearly those female political thinkers whose work should be studied suggestions have included simone de beauvoir hannah arendt rosa luxemburg to name but a few the reach and angle of the syllabus will be limited in any case to politics alevel but just imagine the possible impact if every young person in every school learned a few vital facts about feminism here are the top five topics i would like to see on the curriculum diverse feminism if young people are aware of feminism at all too often their knowledge is limited to a vague notion of bra burners and suffragettes the suffragettes were important pioneers of course but alongside their history students should learn about women such as sophia duleep singh a member of the womens social and political union who fought bravely for womens right to vote as well as battling for indian independence lgbt campaigners workingclass women disabled activists and women of colour whose voices are often written out of neat potted histories of the movement should also be included not to mention feminist movements around the world crossing different countries classes and religions male allies learning about gender inequality at school is the perfect way to bust the myth that feminism is about hating men before it becomes ingrained a feminist syllabus should teach young people how gender stereotypes limit and constrain us all and why it is in everybodys interests to fight for equality regardless of gender from the higher profits earned by companies with diverse boards to the greater stability enjoyed by countries where women are more empowered there are endless factual arguments as to why feminism is beneficial for everybody media analysis we already know that young people are bombarded by gender stereotypes and sexualised images of women from music videos to advertising to online pornography we can campaign to change those things but in the meantime young people are in desperate need of the tools to deal with them helping young people to critically analyse the media they consume from photoshop to the portrayal of sexual violence would be a powerful and practical way to arm students against the body image pressure and hypersexualisation that forms the wallpaper to their daily lives a feministfocused syllabus should teach young people to recognise these stereotypes for what they are and to form their own opinions offsetting the impact of media stereotyping consent and rights the nspcc has found that one in five teenagers have been physically abused by a partner so no school feminism syllabus would be complete without information on sexual consent and healthy relationships many young women are unaware that the groping and touching they have come expect is actually defined as sexual assault under uk law its time we taught young people about their absolute right to decide what happens to their own body educating pupils about genderbased violence could also play a crucial role in tackling rape and domestic abuse later on modern voices feminism is sometimes seen as a historical movement or a battle already won young people would benefit from learning about the rich and vibrant modern side to feminism from authors such as gloria steinem and bell hooks to inspirational teen role models such as singer and actress zendaya and game of thrones amandla stenberg sweden is already leading the way by distributing a copy of chimamanda ngozi adichies book we should all be feminists to every year old why shouldnt britain follow suit,2016-01,feminist rejoiced week news politics alevel give student

women are bearing the brunt of an invisible rise in violent crime a new analysis shows domestic violence and violence against women have increased since researchers found pushing up overall levels of violent crime the findings contradict the official message that violent crime has been in decline since the mids they also begin to challenge the assertion that men are the most likely victims violent crime against men continues to fall a team led by sylvia walby unesco chair in gender research and a professor of sociology at lancaster university discovered the rise in violent crime after looking again at data collected by the crime survey of england and wales csew between and official statisticians cap the number in a series of crimes that a single person can report to the survey at five to stop outliers skewing the statistics but walby argues that this method excludes the experiences of high frequency victims particularly victims of domestic violence who often make up more than of respondents to take these victims into account walby and her colleagues instead looked at all reported crimes the new study also slightly alters the definition of violent crime to include sexual offences such as rape which are usually given their own category in csew figures abandoning the cap and including sex crimes shows the fall in violent crime reached a turning point in when a rise in domestic violence and violence against women by acquaintances begins although violence against women by strangers remains flat and violence against men continues to fall the rises are so marked they fuel an overall rise in violent crime womens groups say it is no coincidence that the rise begins at the same time as the financial crisis and the beginning of austerity politics in britain they are calling for a reversal of cuts to specialist domestic violence services many have closed as a result of belttightening in local government since the change coincides with the repercussions of the financial crisis the researchers point out the turning point in the rate of these violent crimes is consistent with an explanation focused on the reduced economic independence of women and the impact of the cuts to services on which women disproportionately depend they write although they add that more investigation is needed vivienne hayes chief executive of the womens resource centre said that while austerity had played a part in the rise in violence against women some of it was also the result of a troubling resurgence of sexism while we are deeply saddened by the results of walbys research we are not surprised she said our member organisations have been telling us repeatedly that demand for their services which include rape crisis centres and small specialist violence against women and girls services has rocketed whilst investment in services has plummeted research from a range of sources strongly suggests that over the last few years our societal view of women from violent pornography violent computer games street harassment and everyday sexism to the lack of women in positions of leadership and the attempt to remove womens contribution to political progress in the a level curriculum is creating a view of women which nurtures and normalises our violation only when we take a birds eye view of all of these issues and develop a joined up strategy to tackle them head on will we see a reduction in violent crime against women wrc cited house of commons research showing that direct taxes and social security cuts will take bn net a year from families bn of which

experiences of a range of crimes in the past year it is regarded as the gold standard of crime statistics since it includes unreported crimes and is unaffected by changes in police recording practices official statisticians have argued that the cap on the number of crimes a single person can report to eliminate volatility in the results allowing them to better identify trends walby and her colleagues get around that problem by instead using a threeyear moving average of statistics survivors of domestic abuse most often report not just one incident of violence and intimidation or even several but a systematic and sustained campaign of repression that can last years that was the case with ava freebody from sussex who spent years with her abusive husband before she was finally able to escape she has contempt for any suggestion that crime statistics would cap the number in a series of incidents reported by a single victim calling it ridiculous how can you possibly put a cap on something and say that after five times it doesnt count i remember all the incidents i remember all the things that were done to me and to say we are only going to count five times makes me feel worthless she said its like somehow this is your fault its like if this had happened more than five times then you must have been asking for it i think we have a situation here where i think of this as domestic terrorism if the perpetrators were isis we would be throwing so many resources into it and we would recognise the repeated attacks on liberties and health walby also condemned the capping saying it omits crimes and therefore biases the crime rate downwards it is lower than it should be the objection to taking the cap off is that this introduces more yeartoyear volatility uncapping and giving threeyear moving averages provides an unbiased figure that also solves the volatility problem christina jay an activist with sisters uncut which campaigns against cuts to such services added this research proves the urgent need for meaningful investment in domestic violence support we hope the government acknowledges the undeniable human cost of austerity and put substantial measures

new parents could lose hundreds of pounds a year in tax credits when they have their first child under iain duncan smiths welfare changes labour has warned the government has admitted that tax credit claimants may be shifted on to the new universal credit system if they become responsible for a child for the first time owen smith the shadow work and pensions secretary said this meant people will be penalised for getting pregnant the institute for fiscal studies has estimated that inwork benefits under universal credit will be less generous than tax credits by an average of a year for about million working families although some will see their entitlements rise depending on their circumstances ministers are pressing ahead with cuts to universal credit from april this year despite having been forced to cancel cuts to tax credits in november under pressure from mps and peers the latest guidance from the department for work and pensions published this week says any change in circumstances may mean your tax credits stop and you will need to make a universal credit claim instead it lists examples of some changes in circumstances that require a claimant to notify the dwp such as starting work earning more becoming pregnant or having more children lord freud the welfare minister has separately listed significant changes as repartnering or a new member joining the household smith said the conservatives are creating a twotier system thatll see single parents a year worse off compared to being on tax credits this new guidance shows the tories will move families over as soon as they can meaning if someone on tax credits becomes pregnant or gets married they could lose thousands of pounds a year under the new system he said people are gradually being transferred from tax credits to universal credit which rolls six benefits into one monthly payment over the next few years until and are meant to receive transitional protection to stop them seeing any cash losses under the new regime but the transitional protection will not apply to tax credit recipients who are required to make new universal credit claims because their family or working circumstances have changed asked whether a woman who becomes pregnant while receiving tax credits would subsequently be moved to universal credit a dwp spokeswoman said it was irresponsible and misleading scaremongering which fails to reflect the fact that transitional protections put in place by this government will ensure that there will be no cash loss for existing claimants being moved from tax credits onto universal credit it has always been the case that if a claimants circumstances change either by getting married or having a baby with a universal credit claimant they themselves will be moved onto the system this is not new the spokeswoman said the dwp later acknowledged that the birth of a first child could trigger the shift from tax credits to universal credit saying we have always been clear that significant life changes would trigger natural migration to universal credit as they would for existing benefits this is not new under universal credit the dwp spokeswoman added that the impact can only be seen on a case by case basis that it was not possible to compare tax credits to universal credit and that many claimants would receive more under universal credit duncan smith the work and pensions secretary has said those already on universal credit who get lower payments from april will get extra help from a m flexible support fund however it has become clear this may not be a cash payment freud told the house of lords in december that the group affected by the work allowance cut in april are primarily childless singles with no barrier to work those in line for extra help would probably be the more complex cases he said pressed on what the flexible support fund help would entail he said it will vary for each of those families it might be some more work or it might be upskilling to earn more,2016-01,new parent could lose hundred pound year tax credit first child iain duncan smith welfare change labour ha warned government ha admitted tax credit

dating apps have changed the landscape of single life as irrevocably as an aroad through a moor arguably they brought the very act of dating previously a particularly american pastime to british shores but as these apps get woven into the social and sexual fabric of britain so too have their involvement in incidents of sexual abuse assault and violent crime a recent freedom of information request has revealed that crimes with a connection to dating apps increased sevenfold over the past two years from reports in to in the year to october those crimes include some of the most frightening rape sexual grooming and attempted murder but dig under that statistic a little further pick the scab to examine the wound underneath and the picture is not quite so clear nor blame quite so easy to apportion importantly these figures relate to crimes where the app was merely mentioned not necessarily used directly by the perpetrator second we may be at risk of muddying the alreadymurky waters of correlation and causation since thousands of people join dating sites every month according to its website tinder has already created bn matches it is entirely predictable that they will be mentioned in more and more incidents both good and bad just as last year a freedom of information request revealed that the number of crime allegations involving facebook and twitter saw a and increase respectively over a twoyear period so these apps may not necessarily be causing an increase but their ubiquity means they simply record an existing trend perhaps what is particularly misleading about that initial entirely understandable reaction to a terrible set of statistics is that it once again paints sexual assault abuse and rape as something normally perpetrated by strangers it isnt according to refuge two women a week are killed in england and wales by a current or former partner globally one in three women will experience violence at the hands of a male partner according to the nspcc one in five teenagers have been physically abused by their boyfriends or girlfriends in such a climate its unsurprising that a number of people close to me and probably a number of people close to you will have been treated badly violently abusively by their partner i recently interviewed the artist chantal barlow about her work unconventional apology in which she photographs female survivors of domestic abuse by far the most striking and upsetting thing that her project revealed was how people live in daily intimately violent relationships i may have already read that on average a woman is assaulted times before her first call to the police but it is still brutal still shocking to hear of someone having their jaw broken by a husband or head smashed into a picture frame by a girlfriend none of this is to underplay the risk posed by mobile and online dating of course the squirming beast of internet safety is still something that many of us struggle to control on a daily basis it can be tiring not to say counterintuitive to stay vigilant about how much youve revealed through your profile messages and photographs could someone recognise where you live from the background in that photo will they be able to email you at work if you tell them what you do for a living if you start texting will they be able to see your location as well as knowing your number part of what draws people to dating apps like tinder is the hope of meeting someone uncynical unsuspicious and uncalculating in their approach to sex and love that hope and the ease with which you can share personal yet apparently inconsequential details like your surname your employer where you went to university and who you live with all too often deafen us to potential dangers by pulling information from facebook some dating apps make it worryingly easy to overshare some of your most private information to treat strangers as friends you do not have to be tech savvy to download tinder you may never have stopped to think about security settings before you join grindr you quite possibly have never dated before joining these vast swiping clicking communities and that of course can make you vulnerable but and it doesnt matter how many times you hear this it always bears repeating abuse is always the fault of the abuser rape is always the fault of the rapist certain means of communication or certain institutions may make that abuse a little easier to commit or a bit harder to trace but the fault still lies squarely with the perpetrator attach too much blame to the

whod have guessed it would be a tory government that smashed the gender binary thats right maria miller who chairs the women and equalities committee is on a mission to make britain a postgender utopia well sort of shes been hanging around transgender activists recently and has picked up on an idea thats been floating on the internet for some time but until now has evaded mainstream political attention genderneutral passports yes that little m or f on your passport could soon be a thing of the past were all to be people first and gendered beings second the sooner the better if you ask me although i wouldnt have minded a b for bitch personally radical feminists should be delighted theyve been on about ending gender for decades and with good reason as gloria steinem notes the more polarised a cultures gender roles the greater the violence towards women top marks for the trans movement then for taking up the baton and making some real progress at degendering society last year students pushed for genderneutral toilets at various british universities even the white house has unisex loos now reforming officialdom is the next step in an interview with the times miller said as a society and a government we should be looking at ways of trying to strip back talking about gender and only do that when its absolutely necessary we need to understand that gender stereotyping can be as damaging for men as it can be for women its interesting she felt the need to sell the idea to men too but shes right strict gender roles harm everyone take something as frivolous as fashion sixty years ago clothing like gender roles was rigid uncomfortable and strictly divided men looked like men and women looked like women and everyone knew what that meant suit and tie for those with penises high heels and skirts for the vagina set since then the divide in clothing has softened whether or not youre a hippie feminist or postmodernist those movements have probably affected the way you dress people from the margins of society are often in a good position to critique and overturn the rotten norms of the mainstream but back to passports is there a legal argument for having gender markers on official documents ive yet to hear one ostensibly gender markers are there to improve security but while verifying if someone was male or female may have helped victorians feel safe i dont see what good it does anyone in the st century modern passports boast colour photographs hitech deterrents against forgery and biochips most airports have scanners that can see through your clothes its already the future officialdom needs to catch up with itself as miller notes why do we need gender on our driving licence why do we have to have it on our passport if it doesnt really add identification its not relevant australia has decided to degender its passports i really hope this is the start of something all that fuss all that time and money wasted faffing about with gay marriage would have been completely unnecessary if the law had never referenced gender everyone should have the same rights regardless of whether theyre a man woman or any of the myriad new identities that are opening up in not that im in any rush to live in a completely postgender society many people enjoy identifying as men or women the majority of whom of course arent trans does anyone question aretha franklin when she says she feels like a natural woman yet more and more people are identifying as nonbinary these days that is neither male nor female or a mix of both good for them theres space for everyones unique gender identity but i rather enjoy being a woman i suspect many women do when i got my first female passport in as a trans woman i was thrown and overblown with bliss it was like an angel at the passport office had been playing with my heart the state had finally recognised something id known internally for as long as i could remember it even had the queens graffiti tag on it hows that for external validation that doesnt mean the state should make life harder for people who dont identify as male or female though so its time to stop putting people in boxes leave that to advertisers it says something about the pace of change when a conservative mp wants to reform something as iconic as the british passport in the name of trans rights but its the right thing to do lets get rid of gender from all official documents while were at it no sex please were british,2016-01,whod guessed would tory government smashed gender binary thats right maria miller chair woman

my daughter moved from vancouver to britain some years ago to go to university eventually marrying another student she found stable employment and recently gave birth to her first child i love her very much and the geographic distance has been difficult for me to bear although we talk and email and i visit regularly spending time energy and thousands of dollars per trip to maintain our relationship and be supportive of her pregnancy and labour the underlying problem is that my daughter suffers from anxiety and when she is panicked and especially during pregnancy and after she can be very hard on herself and those closest to her her mood swings exhaust me i realise i am dealing with postnatal depression and am relieved that she has the benefit of a good therapist a devoted man friends and support groups if it werent for my grandchild id consider taking a break for a year and just phoning or emailing this would be hard on me and probably on my daughter as well but im tired of holding my tongue in order to keep our limited time together peaceful she had an outright meltdown recently shrieking at me when i made a gentle suggestion about how she might get more rest my daughter is a person of considerable character and intelligence shes also a perfectionist who says that she wants stability and routine and then makes decisions that keep her life complicated a kindhearted soul who alternates between humorous charm and lashing out at those who love her the most id like to find a middle road between tiptoeing around her and being snapped at id greatly appreciate your perspective its brilliant that you have invited a different perspective because when an exchange between two people keeps snagging on the same bushes one really needs to look at taking a different route there was a tightness about your letter i could almost feel you thinking about every word you typed i wonder what it is you are trying to hold so firmly on to it must be hard for you to see your daughter exploding at seemingly small helpful suggestions you make but i wonder if you might see that to her they have long long roots that lead to somewhere else perhaps your suggestions are seen as criticism the psychotherapist naomi stadlen who has written much about motherchild relationships calls these roots the small print new mothers explains stadlen yearn for the loving kindness of their own mothers even if it was in short supply when they were younger what they dont need as new mothers themselves are critical mothers so with the little things like gently suggesting she gets more rest your daughter may hear criticism in the small print the criticism being that she is not getting enough rest as if she is a small overtired child instead of seeing her as a responsible mother doing her utmost for her child you see the difference in emphasis you may at this point think you are not being critical but i would suggest gently that your actions speak louder than your words your letter is full of the things youve done to keep your relationship with your daughter going the airmiles the emotional and financial cost yet there she is anxious critical depressed noncompliant do you think you might be able to step back and look at this differently stadlen thinks that your daughters mood swings were probably the result of her struggling to be polite youve spent so much money and energy travelling all that way to visit her and then you say something annoying and she cant hold her temper in any longer the clue is in the meltdown which you relate in brackets as shrieking at me when i made a gentle suggestion about how she might get more rest your daughter doesnt need unaskedfor suggestions not even gentle ones suggestions usually mask a criticism of how a new mother is managing if she asks you for a suggestion thats a different matter your daughter seems to have a lot going for her what about you what is your life like without her what was her childhood like what was yours like what is stopping you from being able to relax into enjoying your relationship with your daughter and her child what are you afraid of you say your daughter suffers from anxiety and she may well do you say she has postnatal depression but is that a diagnosis or a guess either way do you think you could support her without judgment have you asked her what sort of help she wants from you stadlen asks could you also be suffering from anxiety about your daughter and so exacerbate the problem what your daughter needs is your trust and confidence in her if you think about how well your daughter has done there is plenty to feel trusting and confident about if not downright proud of her if you cant trust your daughter she will feel tense and have times of snapping if you can think about her and feel less anxious she can also relax its clear how much you love your daughter but i think perhaps you need to show your love with a lighter almost invisible

delights of bali illustrating a story about increasing numbers of parents taking their older children on holiday the income gap between generations is widening and a travel consultancy had found that parents were now including offspring in their s and even early s in their travelling an apparent phenomenon given the clumsy appellation genervacation it appears the babyboomer generation is weighed down with a sense of guilt for still having cash to spend when adult offspring are laden with debt struggling to find work and finding it almost impossible to save for a deposit said the story which occupied half a page just one source was quoted for these claims research carried out for the consultancy souk response presented to the travel industry with the encouragement that it had to find ways to attract them all in it cant just be about cottage holidays in devon the story said that since last april people over have had the option of withdrawing of their pensions taxfree unsurprisingly the research said that of those eligible were considering the option and perhaps also unsurprisingly almost of them were planning on spending the money on travel with many of them considering a bigticket holiday for the whole family as readers pointed out in comments below the story online the ability to withdraw of a pension pot taxfree has been available for some years not just since last april whats changed is that up to can be taken taxfree either in one lump sum or as the first of multiple lump sums but more importantly the story omitted a crucial fact the father in the picture of the family on holiday in bali worked for souk response in three paragraphs of quotes from him alongside the picture he was described merely as a creative director with no connection made to the company leaving aside the fact that the offspring in the picture were younger than those now apparently enjoying parental largesse in far away places one was still at school its difficult to disagree with a reader who wrote that this article becomes just an advert for a central london travel consultancy with corporate clients who service such markets that same reader who declared that he worked in the travel trade but not in competition with souk wrote i can only assume that the basis of this article came from a press release submitted by souk response thats not entirely fair a reporter attended a twohour presentation of the research gathering quotes from the firms director used in the piece only far later when editors asked for a case history to illustrate the article did he speak to the souk employee about his holiday im not suggesting that souk was being underhand in any way but the paper should have made the connection plain as a reader wrote i look to the observer for honest and impartial reporting this kind of article erodes that trust and he came close to the truth when he added perhaps it is just a blip and a timepressured journalist submitted copy to an equally busy editor and without too much oversight it got published its worth recording that the same journalists reporting was vindicated last week when an international buddhist sect which he claimed last summer was funded by the chinese to denounce the dalai lama announced it was dissolving the sect had mounted a concerted email campaign against the paper and held a protest near our london office demanding that the story be withdrawn then reuters established beyond doubt the link between the international shugden community and the chinese communist party collapse of protest and a victory for real

my yearold stepson has always been very insecure unlike his yearold sister about four years ago their mother met a man and they all went to live abroad the boy did not want to go and would have preferred to stay with his dad my partner more recently he told his mum that he has thoughts of selfharming he also said a few months ago that he hated his mother and feared his dad could die suddenly both kids adore their father who is devoted to them he calls regularly and visits twice a year my partner is a very stable calm generous and loving feature in their lives and we have lived together for seven years in contrast the mother had a string of shortterm relationships after she decided to terminate their marriage for this man who she then barely knew she left her stable job and removed the kids from their familiar environment my partner pays for all bills related to the children she does not contribute at all towards these expenses my partner and i find that hes been taken advantage of but he feels powerless as he fears she may prevent him from seeing his kids if he does not comply with her financial demands she once threatened to take him to court in any case there is no jurisdiction outside the uk for that and the terms of their divorce state that both should contribute equally towards the children yet he keeps conceding to all her demands i resented immensely losing contact with them i am childless aged i suppose deep down i wanted them to be mine i am encouraging my partner to have a word with his son and assess the situation asking if he would like to live in the uk i fear that if we accept the status quo later on once given the choice the boy will come and live with us anyway but he could be more emotionally damaged my partner however fears separating the siblings who have always been very close where do we go from here your original letter was very long and very loaded against the childrens mother what im confused about is that you really only seem to want one of the children to come over and then only by a certain age it sounds as if the boy is already emotionally in turmoil and would be further damaged by being removed from his sister what then i think you have become so fixated with the status quo and what you dont like about it that youve not given due thought to what would happen if one or both children actually came over it is so easy to look at other peoples children and think you could do things in a better way but remember that however imperfect your partners ex is the childrens mother and nothing in your letter led me to think she was abusing them in any way obviously my advice would be different if she were i contacted alison omahony a therapeutic practitioner aftorguk who specialises in stepfamilies and has vast experience in this field these divorces when the children are quite young are always difficult she says to have these antiex campaigns is never helpful its more about working with what is rather than having a go omahony thinks that your partner probably knows his ex better than anyone he probably knows that if he goes head to head with her hell end up with less i would try very hard not to judge your expartner for this its part of why you love him he is putting the children first perhaps not in the way you think he should however whatever arrangement they came to your ex would have agreed to it you didnt mention a court order so i presume he did the only way to bring one or both children here now would be with the agreement of the mother or via a court order in the country of residence omahony feels that the pressure the children are being put under to in effect choose is not helpful a lot of research says that an acrimonious divorce is more damaging what the children want is to be free to love both parents could you help facilitate that we think thats the way forward omahony recommends not speaking ill of the other parent they are their motherfather so it knocks the selfesteem of the child try to take a step back and let go of the anger which isnt helping do you have another outlet for your outbursts sportfriends if you can really try to understand your partners point of view you have more chance of meeting him in the middle what the children need most is a role model of a successful relationship one of the most useful things you can do for children of divorce omahony says is to teach them critical thinking eg to analyse a situation to think for themselves and look at what is true and where information facts comes from i think this is fantastic advice but lots of adults dont like children to think for themselves its exposing work backwards what do you want to achieve you say children should come first brilliant if you want to help in building these children up into multifaceted thinkingforthemselves adults you are in a great position to do so put your energies into that and your relationship not in making a case for them to leave their mother your problems

tens of thousands of threeyearolds are missing out on free early education according to new research that comes amid growing concerns over local authorities capacity to deliver expanded free childcare provision the report by the family and childcare trust claims that more than threeyearolds are being denied the free childcare to which they are entitled as growing numbers of local authorities struggle to provide funded places in england the number reporting a shortage of free places for three and fouryearolds has more than doubled rising from last year to in according to the research this is particularly concerning the trust argues because this comes before government plans to expand the offer have even been piloted julia margo chief executive of the family and childcare trust said extra free childcare is of no use to working parents if they cant find a place for their child to make childcare really work for parents we want to see the right to an early education place brought in line with the right to a school place under current childcare arrangements there is a universal offer of hours of free care to all parents of three and fouryearolds and of the most deprived twoyearolds david camerons promise to double this to hours with pilots beginning in september this year was a key election pledge neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance added this is a problem that will only worsen with the rollout of the hour scheme many providers have warned that they simply will not be able to deliver the extended scheme not only due to lack of funding but also a lack of available places as such while we welcome the recent promise of increased investment into the sector the problem of insufficient capacity is one that the government simply cannot continue to dismiss the family and childcare trusts annual childcare survey also raises concerns about the continuing decline in the number of childminders which is also likely to impact on the hour offer the survey compares the number of childminders per children under five in different areas of the country and finds huge differences between regions with four childminders per in hull compared to per in bromley leitch said childminders are a vital source of quality flexible childcare and will be integral to the success of the hour scheme and yet a continued lack of support both financial and practical has meant that they are continuing to leave the sector in droves rather than wasting time and resources on its failed childminder agency policy the government should look to start engaging properly with childminders and recognising the pivotal role they play in the provision of quality care and education among other findings the survey also reveals a sharp drop in the numbers of english local authorities who say they have enough afterschool childcare only compared with five years ago only of councils in england reported they had enough childcare for disabled children compared with in the report which gathered responses from just under local authorities in england wales and scotland also looks into childcare costs and found that average prices rose just above inflation throughout britain for the first time in eight years a parttime nursery place hours for a child under two rose by last year and is now a week on average in britain in london the most expensive region prices for the same place rose by to on average according to government figures around threeyearolds and fouryearolds currently receive funded early education the education and childcare minister sam gyimah said this report shows there is record support available for the first time in a decade costs are stabilising and there are rising numbers of places on offer latest figures show more providers are offering the universal hours offer with million children the vast majority taking it up rising numbers of disadvantaged twoyearolds are also benefiting gyimah said there had been huge levels of interest in early pilot schemes for the extended childcare provision with nearly local authorities and providers asking to take part thanks to record investment by this government bn a year by and with our plan to double the free childcare offer for working parents we expect takeup numbers to rise jenny chapman labours minister for childcare and early years said the tories childcare plans are in disarray with the vast majority of areas now facing a shortage of places for three and fouryearolds and a funding shortfall of half a billion this lack of childcare places is continuing to drive up costs for parents with families in some parts of the country now faced with paying over a week for a parttime nursery place without a doubt the tories preelection rhetoric on childcare has failed to match reality and it is children parents and our economy that will pay the price,2016-02,ten thousand threeyearolds missing free early education according new research come amid growing concern local

more than million children living in lowincome families will be affected by a fouryear freeze to their benefits that risks pushing many more into poverty according to new research a report by the childrens society published on tuesday says families could lose up to from the real value of their benefits over the next four years as a result of government plans to freeze child tax credits working tax credits and jobseekers allowance from april the charity is calling on ministers to reconsider the planned freeze and agree to a moratorium on any further cuts in support for lowincome families it says almost two thirds of those who will be adversely affected live in working households who receive benefits to top up low pay the research paper called the future of family incomes was published ahead of a debate in parliament on tuesday about the governments welfare reform and work bill which returns to the commons to consider amendments from the lords charities are also looking anxiously ahead to next months budget matthew reed childrens society chief executive said families on low incomes are facing a barrage of cuts if ministers are genuinely concerned about child poverty they must reconsider plans to freeze benefits over the next four years at the very least the government needs to guarantee there will be no further cuts when the chancellor delivers his budget next month austerity has hit families hard including those in work further cuts to support would push more children into poverty and undermine incentives for families to move into work or earn more according to the end child poverty coalition of children in the uk currently live in poverty the childrens society research attempts to show for the first time the combined impact of the governments key tax and benefit changes on the overall income of different family types some changes such as george osbornes national living wage promise to increase household incomes by other changes will cancel out those gains the charity says by cutting key support for many families in addition to the impact of the freeze the childrens society says lowincome families will be further hit by the new child tax credit limit to the first two children and the end of the family element of the child tax credit young parents and families with disabled children claiming universal credit for the first time are also likely to be hard hit looking at families making new claims the childrens society calculates that a yearold primary school teacher and single motheroftwo renting the family home could be worse off by a month or a year a nurse and her partner with three children renting in london could be worse off by a month a year and a homeowning army corporal and his partner with three children including one who is disabled could be worse off by a month or a year a spokesman for the department for work and pensions said the governments welfare reforms were creating a fairer system and were incentivising work while protecting the most vulnerable we are bringing welfare spending under control while crucially helping people into work and through universal credit helping them to earn more more people than

one radiant summer day over drinks with a male colleague i accidentally stumble on the fact that he is making a substantially higher salary than me i dont remember how this came up just my surprise didnt you ask for more money when you got your job offer he asks no i say miserably reaching for my drink it turns out that when not only he but some other male colleagues received their initial job offers from our university they negotiated for more money and benefits and are all making more than me none is more qualified none works harder while we are waiting to pay i simmer and stew over the almost cliched inequity of it it would be soothing to blame some sort of institutional sexism to take refuge in that but the fault is so clearly evidently unambiguously my own eight years earlier when the voice on the other end of the phone offered me a job as a professor of cultural journalism the thought of asking for more money did not cross my mind i had just come out of a marriage and was trying to reconcile the urgent imperatives of supporting a toddler with my dreamy freelance life i had by this point written four books and tons of essays and articles and had managed to get some teaching experience so i wasnt exactly unqualified for the job but i was wildly thankful for it if the idea of asking for more money had crossed my mind im sure i would have rejected it the question would have seemed prohibitively confrontational ungrateful awkward i imagine the powerful person on the other end of the phone line being repulsed whats wrong with her if i go deeper asking for more money feels crass shameful greedy is being liked on one phone call worth thousands and thousands of dollars i guess it was for me i am not alone the statistics are relentless and unambiguous one study i saw in harvard business review found that of women negotiate for higher salaries when they are hired whereas of men do when ellen pao took over the social news site reddit she banned salary negotiations entirely on the assumption that if anyone is allowed to negotiate their salaries men will always do better than women instead she said we provide offers at the high end and they are nonnegotiable it would seem intuitive that this squeamishness is generational that younger women more firmly ensconced in a transformed feminist world would have an easier time yet thats clearly not the case take jennifer lawrences open letter about not lobbying for more money for a film if im honest with myself i would be lying if i didnt say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight i didnt want to seem difficult or spoiled at the time that seemed like a fine idea until i saw the payroll on the internet after sonys emails were leaked and realised every man i was working with definitely didnt worry about being difficult or spoiled taking a wilfully oblivious stance towards money is a luxury you might observe but its a luxury that a cursory glance at my bank accounts would reveal that at the time of my job offer i didnt in any way have on more than one occasion in my eight years as a single mother i would answer the door and have to talk some man out of turning off my gas or electricity because i hadnt paid the bill before i got tenure from the university i would have recurring nightmares of the children and me sleeping in a giant furnished cardboard box on the street its not that i wasnt nervous about money its that i was not equipped with a cool straightforward productive way to deal with that nervousness is there something idiosyncratic in the way i was raised my yearold mother was an ardent and vocal feminist one night my grandfather gave me a barbie beauty palace and when i woke up the next morning eager to play with it my mother said it was lost she was always writing articles novels one of which was made into a movie but when i ask if she ever one time in her life asked anyone for more money for anything she laughs that would seem rude or impolite that would be like going to someones house and saying i realise you cooked this whole dinner for me but i would rather have steak it seems awkward would i ever have said something like that i would have cut my tongue out which explains a lot i come from a long line of women who would rather cut out their tongue than be paid fairly for their work i also suspect there is something deep in childhood being communicated to most boys that is not communicated to most girls do boys grow up steeped in these negotiations prepped for them i glance over at my sixyearold on an ipad busily slaying zombies and creepers on minecraft and blasting open treasure chests is he somehow absorbing the lesson that you should wrench the gold you need from a largely hostile and bewildering world if i delve into my own sunny childhood vision of working life it would involve stumbling on something i love to do and the universe dispensing a fair amount of money for it to me in some discreet and natural way it would not involve triumphant demands or gleeful warriorlike seizing or confident bargaining astonishing and pathetic as it seems it is hard for me even now to admit that i am working for money it feels much more comfortable to be writing for the joy of getting words on the page or the intellectual play of it or to be teaching for the sheer fun of it it does not seem ok to be writing or teaching to pay the rent or buy groceries i think one of the latent legacies of the powerful feminism of the s is the charismatic notion of women working for fulfilment the idea was embedded deeply in books such as betty friedans the feminine mystique and passed through the generations women should work so they are not bored or restless or idle the importance of work was communicated to us but the importance of supporting your household was not quite as clearly communicated what is mysterious in my particular case is that i am not someone who expends a huge amount of life force trying to be liked in most spheres i dont care much what people think of me i dont mind for instance writing a piece in a newspaper that alienates nearly every liberal rightthinking person in new york over their morning coffee i am also attuned to all the ways niceness is constructed for women the pressure to smile for photographs the urge to apologise for breathing the whole elaborate social construction of female likability and yet when it comes to asking for more money i have a horror of being disliked or of the particular kind of dislike that sort of assertion provokes about six months after my discovery about my male colleagues salaries i make a skittish foray into financial selfassertion i ask someone in a position of power for more money for a project i am doing as soon as i bring up the subject there is a prickliness in the air you shouldnt really compare your fee to other peoples she says but how else does one know whats fair or where one stands how else should i be thinking of it she doesnt say unless i am imagining it she is suddenly annoyed exhausted she does like me less i leave this meeting feeling oddly crushed as if ive been called out for being arrogant and moneygrabbing in the elevator i try to talk myself into not caring but i cant i hear a similar story from a brilliant and competent friend ill call frankie who also teaches at a university she was asking for more money to teach a popular and successful class and suddenly felt the unspoken question emanating from the head of her department why does she think shes so entitled frankies experience cuts to the heart of what i am afraid of in these confrontations it will appear that i think i am special that i have too high an opinion of myself this strikes me as a very female problem spending huge amounts of energy warding off the perception that you are somehow entitled stuck up there is a strong instinct towards diffusing competition deflecting envy towards not having people resent you all the rampant female selfdeprecation the constant apologising is part of this same maddening consuming phenomenon nota bene the new app just not sorry designed to rid womens emails of apologies and hedged authority or amy schumers brilliant skit about women constantly apologising for nothing one might wonder why in this late stage of feminist consciousness some of us still need to appear weaker less competent less confident less powerful than we are to diffuse the hostility of not only men but other women the simple statement my work is worth more than you are offering is in this context hugely fraught it works against some deep secret longterm training that we have been receiving our whole lives to conceal our confidence to slip in under the wire to play down our drive or success or shine so we dont stand out or attract jealousy or resentment there is a brutal sotto voce question that we are always aware of what makes her think she is better than the rest of us i will do a lot to appease and quiet that voice as part of my new minicampaign to do things differently i ask male friends and colleagues how they knew to negotiate they just knew one grew up with diamond merchant parents and sees bargaining and negotiating prices as a natural part of life i think of haggling as a theatre performance he says which seems like a much more benign and upbeat way to think about it than my own fearful and selfconscious approach over the next few weeks i broach the subject with women friends i think of as fearless and formidable in their professional lives but even they seem cautious when it comes to their own salary negotiations a friend ill call sara a supersuccessful businesswoman at the top of her prominent company says i am incredibly aware that as a woman even at the top of the ladder you have to be careful even at the highest level women are judged differently one female professor decided she would ask for more money after her job offer she is personally and ideologically committed to this because she is alert to the larger sociological context but in the moment the request still made her incredibly rattled instead of writing her own letter she went on to a website for women in academia and cut and pasted a form letter later it occurred to her that she was a more stylish writer and should have written it in her own words the university said no i understand her impulse to dig up a template it feels as if there is no blueprint no model no instruction manual or primer that would offer guidance it occurs to me that i should go back to sheryl sandbergs lean in when the book came out i had a slightly snobbish attitude i felt warmly towards it vaguely approved of it but i thought it applied to other people more corporate types women who hadnt grown up with a feminist mother heckling them their whole childhood but actually the book speaks to exactly the psychological hesitations and inner skirmishes i am talking about sandberg writes no wonder women dont negotiate as much as men its like trying to cross a minefield backward in high heels a writer i admire and look up to who is in her early s tells me she used to accept whatever fee anyone offered her to give lectures now she just says no and they always offer more for a few months i resolve to try to do the same thing even if people dont like me as much as they liked me when i said yes to everything on their terms i have to steel myself for it it feels unnatural aggressive when i actually bring myself to do it though i experience a weird jolt of power i write this email to an editor i would love to do this but not sure i can afford to take the time to do it properly for that amount of money i am sorry i would like to be more highminded but life intrudes is there any way you could do a little better on the fee i am still apologising of course but at least i am asserting in a semistraightforward way a sense of what my work is worth a few months earlier i would have taken the lower fee and got on with it i am astonished when minutes later the editor writes back suggesting a substantially higher fee it was that easy but you have to ask the basic idea that the world is built on a million tiny negotiations and transactions that every day people are asking for more money and some are getting it and some are not should not be a revelation to a reasonably worldly professional person but when my colleague told me about negotiating for his salary it honestly felt as if a veil was lifted from my eyes people do that i sometimes think about what i would do if i got a job offer now my first instinct would still be to be accommodating polite i would still worry about being aggressive or making the person offering me the job feel unhappy or awkward or put out one has to wonder where this responsibility to make strangers feel warm and happy comes from did women inherit the responsibility to erase all the awkward moments in the world but i would force myself to ask i would argue myself down i would promise myself a beautiful impractical pair of shoes if i managed to get the words out fake it till you make it as the saying goes as a coda i ask my lanky superconfident yearold daughter folded up in a kitchen chair and wolfing down chocolate cookies whether if someone handed her too little money for babysitting she would ask for more she says naaaah probably not the battle i notice remains uphill katie roiphes the violet hour is published by virago on may at order a copy for from the

my husband and i dont want to have kids and thats ok that might change but right now were happy with the way things are and want to keep them that way you disagree quite vehemently disagreement between us is nothing new we disagree on a lot of things and thats ok whats not ok however is being disrespectful of our decisions i understand that your constant challenges towards this particular decision come from a good place i really do but what you want for us isnt necessarily what we want for ourselves ive never really been into kids you know that while other little girls loved to feed change and nurture their plastic dollies i was elsewhere playing dressup and makebelieve i was more interested in being a kid than pretending to look after one despite your predictions nothing changed as i grew older i didnt want to babysit the neighbours kids and i only managed to stick teaching for a year before quitting because i was exhausted all the time you used to shrug off my disinterest by saying that id grow out of it that id just wake up one day and wouldnt just want a baby id need one but as the years have gone by and my biological clock has continued to tick along without the slightest hint of alarm you have changed tack unable to accept that our choice is because of our fundamental lack of interest in parenting you have started to accuse me of wilfully denying myself a baby as a way of rebelling against society and of course my motherin law i freely admit that i find my motherinlaw irritating but what you accuse me of is not only ridiculous its quite unkind our decision to remain childfree wasnt made lightly it was painstaking and deliberate ive spent hours thinking about whether we should have kids or not weighing up the pros and cons envisioning life in each scenario and listening to our friends experiences but the answer has always remained kids no thank you i know thats hard for you to understand i know you desperately want grandkids and i think that is partly because our relationship is distant you want to repair the damage you did when you left dad for your boyfriend and to have a closer relationship with me i suppose you imagine us bonding over the trials of motherhood and through the sharing of your parenting experiences and knowledge but children arent the answer to broken relationships you know that when i was a kid you were a great mum kind and caring always so patient but being a good parent means that at some point you need to acknowledge that your child has become an adult and as such has the right to make their own decisions even if you disagree with them thats all im asking you to do im asking you to be a good parent and to treat us as your equals im asking you very nicely to stop the eye rolling and raised voices to stop the snide jabs and sad looks and start demonstrating your love and affection by trying to accept and support our decisions rather than trying to change them sincerely your loving daughter,2016-02,husband dont want kid thats ok might change right happy way thing want keep way disagree quite vehemently disagreement u nothing new disagree lot thing thats ok whats ok however

i have written before in this column about siblings no surprise since i have four daughters but what has been occurring to me recently is not how birth order determines personality it doesnt or how important sibling relationships are to character development very but the sheer violence of the emotion between individual children caught up in this most ancient of rivalries it always shocks me watching my otherwise sweet goodnatured children turn into vengeful monsters when it comes to one another most particularly the ones that are closest in age i have memories of jean and rose both now in their s growing up with what was sometimes persistent and bitter conflict a rivalry so intense and magnetic that you would need a crowbar to pull them apart likewise i can see louise bugging eva nine just for the fun of it and eva winding up louise out of a perverse desire to provoke a reaction and thus get her older sister in trouble my wife and i react to this differently because she is an eldest sibling and i am a younger thus she is inclined to leave them to it when there is a row whereas i am much more inclined to intervene often on louises behalf since i more readily identify with the greater vulnerability of the younger child on the other hand i can be blind to the strategies the younger uses to provoke the older i have no doubt that if as a child i had had access to a gun i would have shot my older brother on several occasions so extreme were the emotions he raised in me knowing me so well he could humiliate and get at me more than anyone else particularly as being older he had superior mental and emotional capabilities to do so i was thus helpless both helplessly seeking his approval and helpless in the face of his hostility i had at one point in my life assumed that my experience with my brother was a particularly extreme example however after i researched a never to be published book about siblings and interviewed a number of psychologists this turned out to be less the case than i had assumed hate was as much a part of siblinghood as love the psychologist dorothy rowe for instance who wrote the book my dearest enemy my dangerous friend about sibling rivalry notes all sibling relationships are based on the sense of protecting the self sibling relationships are about being validated or invalidated as a person a small child engaged in trying to reconcile his need to be good with his need to be the person he is discovering himself to be also discovers shame feeling that he is exposed and vulnerable to annihilation and even wanting annihilation in order to escape from the mocking hostile eyes that are upon him for small children often discover shame at the hands of their older siblings who laugh at them and scorn them for being unable to do the things they can do in other words older siblings are in a very powerful position with respect to the younger and the temptation is at times to try and psychologically destroy them for not only can they be irritating but they are rivals who steal attention and love the result on the side of the younger can be an enduring sense of shame this dynamic persists throughout life as the difference in reaction of my wife and i to our children demonstrates what is to be done nothing really siblings fight they always have and always will it is part of their personality and how they define themselves the main thing is to keep deadly weapons out of reach it worked for me anyway or rather for my brother timlottwriter,2016-02,written column sibling surprise since four daughter ha occurring recently

if seemed like a yearlong consciousnessraising exercise on domestic violence a communal confronting of a onceugly secret this will be the year we find out whether we will seriously do something about it the funding of refuges the role of the police and courts the holding to account those who terrorise their partners at home all these things are under scrutiny across the the country there is unprecedented momentum goodwill and hope yet there remains a tension barely spoken about publicly in australia about something fundamental why is domestic and family violence happening in the first place what causes it the tension is far from theoretical what is the best approach if we want to not just respond to violence after it happens but prevent it before it starts and if we want to prevent intimate partner violence in particular how much hard evidence is there about what works and what does not politicians senior police domestic violence organisations many researchers and most of the media speak virtually in one voice about the causes of domestic violence saying the irrefutable evidence is that the root cause or key driver is gender inequality the dominance of men in our culture and the stubborn stereotypes about the role of men and women malcolm turnbull took little time after he became prime minister last september to call for a cultural shift in australias attitudes to women let me say this to you disrespecting women does not always result in violence against women but all violence against women begins with disrespecting women this view is pervasive often presented as selfevident yet there are serious researchers who have serious doubts they suggest we are getting this wrong or at least partly wrong and urge a more nuanced discussion and policy response if they are right ideology and politics are far too dominant in australias approach to such a crucial issue at such a crucial time if they are wrong it may be that many of us are resistant to acknowledging the deep sexism embedded in the culture and its role in violence against women both physical and psychological the current responses to domestic violence need to be enhanced or replaced with evidencebased approaches like addressing contributing factors such as alcohol drugs and mental health says prof peter miller principal research fellow and codirector of the violence prevention group at deakin university millers expertise is violence especially alcoholrelated violence a factor in around half of domestic violence incidents reported to police and twothirds of incidents in indigenous communities the politics of gender need to take a back seat now says miller it is time to change otherwise the feminist framework while vital will become a hindrance there has never been so much determination to reduce the violence happening routinely in our homes domestic violence usually refers to intimate partner violence most commonly by men against women family violence is a broader term that includes violence within a family such as a teenager assaulting a sibling or a parent this is a violence that kills on average one woman each week in australia terrorises children who witness it often for the rest of their lives and is soaking up police time and resources police respond to a domestic violence call every eight minutes it is not at all clear that domestic violence is increasing and the percentage of homicides classified as domestic has gone down in recent years but what has indisputably soared is the reporting of attacks to police one sign of a transformed culture victoria is conducting australias first royal commission into family violence due to report next month and respectful relationship programs will be compulsory in schools from this year the government is preparing the states first gender equality strategy specifically to reduce violence against women for the first time the state governments of victoria new south wales and queensland have appointed ministers charged with preventing domestic and family violence nsw is rolling out initiatives including specialist police squads targeting repeat domestic violence offenders and the countrys first disclosure scheme that would enable a person to find out if their partner has a violent criminal history a controversial british idea also being considered in other states queensland has had an inquiry led by the former governor general quentin bryce and the government has pledged to implement all recommendations domestic violence involves every level of government and there is a strong expectation of national leadership and for agreement on a common approach one of turnbulls first acts as prime minister was to commit himself to an issue he called a national disgrace a national summit is due later this year and the minister for women michaelia cash expects a national domestic violence order scheme to be introduced in the first half of the year there is so much activity endless media coverage and calls for all of us to do something yet at the beginning of a new year there is also a pause a holding of collective breath until a few crucial things are clarified the conclusions of victorias royal commission are awaited across the country another big test will be this years federal budget and what resources and policies are pledged just as vital is the strategic response the next phase of the national plan to reduce violence against women and their children is due in the next few months most australians would be unaware of it but the plan started in as a year bipartisan pledge to achieve a significant and sustained reduction in violence against women and their children by all state and territory governments signed on the plan is now at its halfway mark and the government is soon to announce whats called the third action plan essentially what steps will be taken from this year until the problem is as dr lara fergus of our watch says that it hasnt got anywhere on its key goal while the plan is given credit for achieving unprecedented cooperation between the states and territories it hasnt resulted in any measurable reduction in domestic violence or changes in community attitudes about violence against women in fact nothing much that any government has done since the issue was first pushed on to the public agenda in the s has prevented domestic violence this is do or die says fergus of the importance of this moment fergus is the director of policy and evaluation at our watch a group set up under the national plan to drive policy to prevent violence against women and their children the overarching goal is to achieve a sustainable and significant reduction in violence against women and their children by which is a huge ask no country in the world has ever seen a reduction like that she says were halfway through this plan which was visionary and worldleading when it was released and we havent seen any movement on that primary goal what is proposed and our watch is central to it is a national prevention strategy that would indeed be a world first there is huge momentum behind it and at heart it means this if we accept the evidence that gender inequality is the root cause of domestic violence we need to transform relations between men and women at every level to significantly reduce it no other country has taken that approach in a systemic and nationally endorsed way our watch defines gender inequality as the unequal distribution of power between women and men and adherence to rigid or narrow gender roles and stereotypes it is the patriarchy and all the sexist assumptions that go with it that is the root cause or key driver of domestic violence against women under this analysis we need to transform the balance of decisionmaking power between men and women and end sexist assumptions about male and female behaviour if we want to prevent domestic violence we need to eliminate the gender gap in wages in political participation in leadership positions if we want to stop domestic violence we need to change the way we raise our boys and girls we need to shift the way we think about womens and mens roles seemingly small things such as sexist jokes and assumptions that men are better at leadership than women need to be confronted all these goals may be laudable in themselves but the argument is they are essential to reducing or even eliminating violence against women our watch and other groups say domestic violence at its heart is a symptom of a deeply sexist culture and the way to reduce it is deep societal transformation it will take time at least a generation to get there it is not possible to end violence against women and their children without addressing the systemic inequalities of power between men and women along with the construction of narrow and stereotypical gender roles that support and are reinforced by these inequalities it says in november our watch released a national framework to prevent violence against women and their children called change the story it was a watershed moment according to its chair natasha stott despoja a world first such a framework was anticipated under the national plan and the expectation now is for all governments state and federal to endorse it this is the approach that domestic violence groups and others involved in this area want the federal government to adopt for the next stage of the national plan that would sign australia up to a strategy with a specific gender equality approach including sustained respectful relationship programs in schools that would involve teachers and the broader community as well as students to challenge gender stereotype a big communication campaign that would go well beyond awareness raising getting the media to change the way it reports on gender issues and for business to commit to seriously address gender inequality in the workforce the details of how this will be done remain sketchy but the important first step is to get the strategy endorsed consensus is close it is difficult to name one person involved in this area in a senior position who questions the gender equality framing of domestic violence michaelia cash launched the our watch strategy ken lay former victorian police commissioner and now chairman of the council of australian governments advisory panel on reducing violence against women and their children says knowingly or not we give boys licence to act abusively and we develop in girls deference to that behaviour boys will be boys and its up to girls to adjust accordingly our culture is possessed of destructive attitudes about gender that allow domestic violence to prosper rosie batty australian of the year says if you do not see that domestic violence as a gendered issue i have no idea what we have to do to convince you because right now i do not hear of two men a week being murdered at the hands of their partners domestic violence groups were heartened to hear turnbull framing the issue in the same way as they do as one about cultural attitudes to women it was a real shift in the language and it is clearly aligned with what were saying says fergus there is a real opportunity to pull this together but if not a single other nation has tried to transform its gender relations with the express purpose of reducing violence against women is there any evidence it will work we have nothing we can look at in another country and say look at how well it worked over there we are asking for leadership says fergus dr emma partridge who spent a year researching and writing the our watch framework says there is little evidence specific actions by governments have reduced the prevalence rates of domestic violence the problem is bigger the problem is deeper the problem is far more substantial and far more entrenched in social and cultural norms structures and practices she says therefore you need a much bigger deeper more significant approach to dealing with it of course its a hypothesis because no ones ever tried to change the gender norms structures and practices in a society at a population level before all of which makes people such as the violence researcher peter miller very frustrated indeed miller has no doubt gender inequality is critical to understanding domestic violence especially given the history of courts police politicians and the broader population either turning a blind eye to violence against women or condoning it women have struggled for equality and continue to do so in both developed and developing nations husbands beating wives was once legal under common law the famous dictum of the th century judge francis buller was that a man could chastise his wife physically so long as the stick was no thicker than his thumb it wasnt until the s that all australian states made rape in marriage a crime but miller argues there have been significant changes in attitudes in australia and other developed nations both legislatively and culturally the feminist dominance of the debate now is deeply flawed he says if the goal is to prevent the tiny number of men who do commit violence from doing so he says the debate now assumes domestic violence is completely different from other forms of violence whereas they have much in common and he says the gender inequality thesis ignores that women are perpetrators in a substantial minority of cases and that there is domestic violence between samesex couples which has nothing to do with gender inequality the decision for the very small percentage of people to step over that line to strike somebody else is exceptionally complicated and it doesnt come down to whether their attitudes towards men or women are inappropriate he says in other countries there are different discourses that are better informed by evidence its not simply the gender inequality card thats played however important that is miller is finishing a study into the role of alcohol and drugs in family violence he know that views like his are unpopular and believes research is too dominated by those who take a strong feminist approach to violence against women he says a few years ago a major health organisation commissioned him to research alcohols role in interpersonal violence but refused to publish it because it didnt like its conclusion that alcohol was a causal factor a proposition anathema to those convinced of the gender inequality thesis he doesnt want the organisation named because he says it wouldnt help to get past the blackandwhite approach in australia and because there are so few organisations funding research in this country we are in danger of both losing credibility and momentum in australia he says as much as i believe that i am some sort of feminist i am not one that puts that agenda over the agenda of fixing this issue and reducing violence thea brown has also had difficulties researching domestic violence brown has been a professor of social work at monash university for more than years and is finishing off a major study into parents who kill their children and so when she started a research project in into domestic violence and whether mens behaviour change programs actually changed mens violent behaviour she was astonished at the harassment she says she received brown told victorias royal commission into family violence last year that she had never experienced anything like it in all her years of research she says the feminist framing of domestic violence among some groups is so strong they are nervous about academic research in case their approach is shown to be flawed theres a very strong ideology in some domestic violence services and it becomes an antiresearch ideology because research is feared in case it threatens the ideological basis of the program brown told the commission it is a problem when ideology rather than evidence forms a basis of discussion and has the impact of stifling discussion to the commission and in an interview with guardian australia brown said that no to violence the peak victorian body whose members run mens behaviour programs advised their members not to cooperate with browns research that made it much harder for brown to approach men to participate and the research was delayed for months her results will be published this year browns view is that no to violence was suspicious that her research might find its approach a feminist one that challenges mens attitudes towards women flawed brown broadly agrees with the perspective that domestic violence is at heart about gender inequality but she resented the notion that that should have any influence on academic research no to violences chief executive jacqui watt was not involved in the organisation when browns research began but she says there were concerns about its methodology and usefulness and they werent consulted before it began we told our members that we cant vouch for the safety of this work and therefore we cant say to you you should participate we didnt say dont she tells guardian australia the group is unashamedly feminist in its approach but watt says it has no problem with research this is just one incident but it brings to the surface the the role of preexisting beliefs in research particularly in such a highly charged area as domestic violence there are no definitive studies and the area is still relatively new for now the most common model to explain what causes domestic violence is the socalled socioecological model used by the world health organisation for all forms of interpersonal violence it suggests and our watch and other domestic violence groups endorse it that you cant only explain violence in terms of the individual such as whether a person was drunk or whether they suffered a mental illness or were unemployed you need to put the violence in a social context of women being seen as less important than men and of sexist assumptions being so normal we barely notice them its a longrunning debate psychologists and others emphasise the individual reasons why someone becomes violent while acknowledging the cultural feminists overwhelmingly emphasise the cultural economic and political it is not as though our watch denies the complexity of domestic violence it names many reinforcing factors such as alcohol poverty and mental illness that can increase the likelihood and severity of violence but it stresses that gender inequality is the underlying cause with other issues intersecting with gender at different times and in different communities factors including alcohol and childhood trauma come into play sometimes but gender inequality is always there they insist yet contributing or reinforcing factors are hardly given prominence lay never talks about them batty whose campaigning on domestic violence has done as much as anyone to deepen the understanding of the issue seldom emphasises them a video our watch released to go with the change the story strategic plan is blunt this is a story about a boy and a girl it begins the girl is told how pretty she is never how clever she is that if she wears a short dress shes asking for it as for a boy he learned that women arent equal to men from a very early age this is a story of how gender inequality contributes to the murder of around one australian woman almost every week the video raises no other factor involved in domestic violence our watch did release a page report summarising the local and international evidence on the causes of domestic violence it acknowledges that the field is still new but argues the evidence on the central role of gender inequality is strengthening fergus says there has been an explosion of research in the past decade and the old approach that there was a shopping list of factors causing violence against women has become more sophisticated factors such as alcohol or mental illness or the experience of violence in the perpetrators childhood filter through the key issue of gender inequality locally a november report commissioned by the federal government on young peoples attitudes towards violence against women brought lay to tears that report is designed to inform a m government prevention campaign and its crucial finding is that while australians overwhelmingly reject domestic violence as criminal unconscious attitudes towards violence against women persist especially among young people we are raising our children to perpetuate violence against women it says when presented with scenarios in which men were aggressive towards women boys as young as were quick to blame the victim suggesting the girl was in part responsible girls were fast to blame themselves when presented with identical scenarios with one suggesting a male was just having a bad day do these attitudes lead to violence our watch says they do surveys such as the national survey on community attitudes to violence against women found that men who held sexist patriarchal or sexually hostile attitudes were more likely to condone or perpetrate violence against women fergus and others are open about the gaps that remain in the research and dont pretend the gender inequality analysis is settled for instance one ubiquitous claim is that countries with greater gender equality have lower rates of domestic violence often cited is a graph below from a un comparison of countries that graph is everywhere our watch publishes it as did victorias royal commission yet its relevance to countries like australia is questionable miller dismisses it as nonsense because the countries with higher levels of gender equality and lower levels of domestic violence are countries like australia measurements include life expectancy between men and women adult literacy educational opportunities and wage equality its a classic fallacy argument miller says the countries with greater gender equality have got better rates of all forms of violence theyve got lower rates of economic and social inequity do i want our society to look more equitable absolutely would i put it down to just a single variable absolutely not according to who research the highest rates of physical and sexual violence are in countries where women may have few rights at all such as iran iraq liberia and ethiopia australia is in the high income category where rates of domestic violence are lowest along with nations such as canada denmark france germany hong kong iceland japan israel new zealand and britain violence generally and violence against women in particular remains unacceptably high but overall the wealthier and more developed a nation the lower the rates of domestic violence tend to be fergus acknowledges the limitations of that graph but says there are other studies that take into consideration a nations level of development one important analysis of surveys from countries published in the lancet controlled for a countrys socioeconomic status it looked at womens status economic participation political participation and genderrelated attitudes it concluded that while it is irrefutable that violence against a partner decreases as gdp increases gdp is actually a marker for more complex social processes and transformations in womens roles that frequently accompany economic growth and modernisation it supported the gender hypothesis of domestic violence saying that even at the country and regional level it was factors related to womens status such as educational achievement womens access to employment and property and male authority over women that helped predict the prevalence of violence against women at victorias royal commission the commissioner marcia neave asked pointed questions of fergus and renee imbesi from vichealth a statutory authority that has played a leading role in promoting the gender inequality thesis first neave asked if domestic violence is at heart about gender inequality and gender inequality has improved significantly in australia in the past few decades why has there not been a big reduction in violence against women second if scandinavian and nordic countries in particular have good records on gender inequality what is the evidence that there are lower incidences of family violence compared with australia and third is too much effort going into gender equality at the expense of the causes of violence more generally whether against men or women and how we might reduce it fergus says the question about why domestic violence has not significantly improved in australia is a really good question and one we dont know the answer to weve only actually been doing the personal safety survey since that survey measures all forms of interpersonal violence in it found that one in four women in australia had experienced at least one violent incident at the hands of an intimate partner or expartner since the age of fergus points out that data is based on reported violence and that as gender equality improves women are likely to feel more confident to report it responses from police and other services improve too my second answer to that question is that most measures of gender equality in a country are structural ones things like legal equality levels of education representation in parliament whereas what we are talking about and this is what gets us into hot water is not just about the structural stuff we break it down into structures norms and practices the structures are what we mostly measure but social norms the things we believe are harder to measure and just as powerful thats whats changed on smoking in the last years the social norm of it being cool the question of whether countries with high levels of gender equality at least legislatively have lower rates of domestic violence is far from clearcut according to the world economic forums global gender gap index the five most genderequal countries in the world as measured by the gap between men and women on health and survival outcomes education economic participation and political empowerment are all nordic countries iceland finland norway sweden and denmark all those countries are considered to be global role models according to the report having closed more than of the gender gap for instance at the top of the list is iceland once called the most feminist place in the world it has the highest womens labour participation rate in the world for instance at supported by heavily subsided childcare with each parent receiving three months parental leave and another three months for either parent gender quotas for company boards are enshrined in law australia ranks th of the countries measured rating highly on education and heath but falling down on political empowerment such as women in parliament and in ministerial jobs if the gender inequality analysis were correct nordic countries would be expected to have lower rates of violence against women yet a major study released in found that nordic women experienced the worst physical or sexual violence in the eu more than women in the eus countries were questioned face to face about physical sexual and psychological violence by partners and nonpartners just over of danish women interviewed said they had experienced physical andor sexual violence at least once since the age of followed by of finnish women and of swedish women according to the poll by the eu agency for fundamental rights which promotes human rights throughout the union the agencys head of research joanna goodey struggled to explain the results suggesting women in these countries were perhaps more aware of domestic violence and more likely to talk about it what is also hypothesised is that as womens equality improves there is a backlash from men feeling their power is eroding which may temporarily increase domestic violence for those convinced that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the gender inequality analysis and therefore how countries need to to respond to it the resistance is a predictable response from those either invested in the way things are or from those uncomfortable in facing the realworld consequences of a maledominant society gender challenges people that is the crux of the issue says fergus it goes to the core of our identities our relationships who we think we are whether we think our society is functioning as it should or not she says with a note of frustration the evidence is settled its in its there when i say im confident im really confident there are others less confident and equally frustrated that the dominance of the gender equality way of looking at domestic violence is pushing out other significant factors that they argue could make a big difference to reducing violence against women if they werent so sidelined for instance reports of domestic violence to police in common with all forms of violence is concentrated in disadvantaged areas particularly in the regions and in remote indigenous communities the suggestion that domestic violence is experienced by all women in all communities is of course true but there are pockets where it is far more pronounced in a study of domestic assaults reported to nsw police from to out of the top local government areas were rural or regional areas and the top five were all remote bourke walgett moree plains coonamble and wentworth four of the five have aboriginal populations whose experience of violence of all kinds is far higher than that of nonindigenous people one of the strongest predictors of violence is being exposed to it as a child or being abused as a child a who analysis of studies found that exposure to violence during childhood increased the likelihood of someone being a perpetrator three or four times overwhelmingly its about a history of violence in their own life says miller victims become perpetrators and victims become victims its not inevitable he says early intervention and positive role models can break the cycle but the evidence is irrefutable in a statement to the victorian royal commission the mental health expert prof patrick mcgorry stated unequivocally that family violence was the result of multiple factors including untreated or poorly treated mental illness andor substance misuse these are potent causal factors which have been very poorly responded to in terms of preventive care while there is no intention to make any excuses for criminal behaviour or oversimplify the drivers of violence there seems to be a reluctance to even discuss or highlight the obvious facts in some of these highprofile cases one highprofile case was that of greg anderson battys former partner who murdered their son luke batty in at a suburban cricket ground outside melbourne the coroner ian gray last year found that anderson was likely to have had a mental illness he was fixated on religion and experienced delusions and that many chances to connect him with mental health support had been missed mostly a result of his own reluctance fergus agrees that more work needs to be done on how different individual factors intersect with gender inequality to cause violence against women she agrees too that in individual cases some factors loom larger than others but none of them by themselves drives the violence and none of them operates in and of itself she says they all operate through a society in which we have extreme levels of gender norm structures practices gender stereotyping differences in power and relationships to a layperson its not easy to understand why whether something is labelled a cause or a driver or a contributing factor matters much however it is achieved the aim is to prevent the violence happening there is history to this fergus says that in the s when domestic violence first attracted serious attention the feminist theorising about what caused it was just that as much a political stance as an evidencebased one but she says the evidence is now firmer and while public opinion may be lagging tackling gender inequality is the key way to bring about big change while a lot of other issues also need attention its crucial we put in the resources needed to transform gender relations if we are to have any hope of sustainably reducing future violence the tension in all this is most obvious when it comes to alcohol michael thorn is the chief executive of the foundation for alcohol research and education and a former senior official in the department of the prime minister and cabinet he knows how policy works and how politics works the foundations mission is to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol in australia it has produced several papers on the role of alcohol in domestic and family violence with detailed suggestions about how to reduce it through fairly straightforward legislative measures a few weeks ago thorn was at a meeting in canberra with public servants working with lay and batty on the coag group advising australian governments you can kind of see it in their eyes that after years and years of trying to get domestic violence on to the political agenda not that i believe it was ever off the agenda this is their historic opportunity to correct what they see as wrongs about gender equality in this country thorn believes the issue has been politicised by the dominance of the gender equality framework he goes to endless meetings makes submissions has appeared before the royal commission but so far has had nil impact despite all our efforts over the past year none of the announcements that have been made by various governments now adding up to probably half a billion dollars of investment respond directly to alcohols contribution to family violence quentin bryces queensland report embraced the gender inequality argument dismissing alcohols role in just a few lines thorn was at least heartened that victorias royal commission devoted a full day to alcohol and other drugs and appeared to be taking the issue seriously thorn says alcohol can be considered a cause of violence in a public health sense but he avoids the word because its like a red rag to a bull to domestic violence groups yet he says alcohol is the lowhanging fruit that could reduce violence now without having to wait for generational change that may or may not happen alcohols link to violence of all kinds is undeniable including violence in the home it is involved in about half of domestic violence incidents attended by police and violence incidents involving alcohol tend to be more frequent and severe almost of intimate partner homicides are alcoholrelated and that rises to of indigenous intimate partner homicides which means alcohol had been consumed by the perpetrator victim or both thorn cites numerous studies that show reducing the availability of alcohol reduces violence one example is nsws restrictions on alcohol in sydneys cbd and kings cross it involves measures such as pm closing for bottle shops across the state and a am lockout assaults dropped in kings cross and throughout the cbd the changes have proved controversial yet the crime researcher dr don weatherburn has said it was one of the most dramatic effects ive seen in my time of policy intervention to reduce crime the impact of the law changes on domestic violence specifically are now being assessed in victoria the alcohol researcher michael livingston has found that a higher density of alcohol outlets is associated with increases in reports of family violence a increase of takeaways which are concentrated in disadvantaged areas were associated with a more than increase in domestic assaults and in western australia the researcher tanya chikritzhs reported that for every additional litres of pure alcohol sold by an offsite outlet such as a bottle shop the risk of violence in homes increased by despite findings such as these liquor outlets in australia have soared in recent years the victorian premier daniel andrews is a champion of the gender equality thesis we must educate that sexist behaviour and gender inequality if unaddressed lead to sexual assault and family violence he says but he never discusses the role of alcohol thorn wants measures to reduce or cap the number of alcohol licences and to tighten trading hours the big one has got to be trading hours that is the most costeffective public policy intervention you can make from a government perspective it costs very little its a legislative move theres no multimillion dollar advertising campaign you dont need thousands of public servants you just have to say closing times are whatever am so why wont government do something so relatively cheap and effective thorn has no doubt the alcohol industrys vested interests is extraordinary and the way it has managed to engineer a culture of fear in politicians is extraordinary the victorian government defunded our research centre theyre reviewing the liquor act theyve got the liquor industry deeply involved in the policy discussions what chance do we have thorn says many domestic violence groups especially in victoria will barely speak to him so furious are they that he dares to suggest alcohol is a causal factor in domestic violence in many cases there is acknowledgement that alcohol contributes to domestic violence but wariness about overplaying it the fear as fergus puts it is that focusing on alcohol lets the guy off the hook its actually saying ok its the alcohol thats the problem it wasnt your controlling behaviour it wasnt the attitude towards the woman in your life it was the fact that you got drunk and lost control partridge also points out that those who focus on alcohol as a cause often criticise women for drinking because it may make them more vulnerable to assault theres a lot of victimblaming in that theres a lot of use of terms like vulnerability and womens use of alcohol and feminists just bristle at that yet thorn remains sceptical that a longterm strategy to improve gender equality will reduce violence against women in any significant way ill probably end up beaten up but im a little wary of it i keep coming down to our argument that dealing with alcohols contribution will give you very significant gains now whereas the gender equality issues are going to take a generation and as some of my colleagues say good luck with that changing the behaviour of teenage boys one suggestion has been for australia to follow an experiment in south dakota in the us since the state has required those arrested or convicted for repeat drinkdriving to take two alcohol breath tests a day or wear an alcoholmonitoring bracelet as well as as big reduction in drinkdriving offences the surprise result was a reduction in arrests for intimate partner assaults thorn wants something like that trialled in australia targeting repeat family violence offenders who would have to show zero alcohol use to be allowed to remain in the community miller says he has put the idea to lay who raised resourcing problems one of the key messages around this is that when you take alcohol out of the picture for a very small group of the population who are obviously indicated as problem people you get this huge reduction in domestic violence we are a bit crazy not to have tried it already there is one area where domestic violence groups are less adamant about the central role of gender equality when applying it to indigenous communities particularly in remote areas it is perhaps a reflection of the struggles feminism has had with intersectionality the role of race class and sexuality in womens experiences so is the patriarchy the dominant role of men in aboriginal communities the sexist assumptions from childhood the root cause of horrific levels of partner and family violence in some communities or not if we believe alcohol is a key reason for violence in some communities the northern territory senator nova peris has said that if you are not tackling alcohol then you are not tackling domestic violence then why would it not be central in nonindigenous communities partridge wont say gender inequality plays the same role in indigenous communities experience of domestic violence and she wont say it doesnt she does insist though that in most areas of social policy indigenous communities are understood as a special case because the history of colonisation means they are subject to a whole heap of circumstances and impacts and factors and drivers and influences that no other community in australia is people find themselves pushed to one side or the other on this question so there are some indigenous people saying this white feminist model doesnt apply at all because its colonisation and its racism thats what drives violence and there are other indigenous people saying its time we need to stop this discourse that allows our men to use colonisation and racism as an excuse for violence its about gender we need a black feminist analysis of violence i guess were somewhere in the middle trying to acknowledge the nuances and the complexities of that we wouldnt say oh yes this gender inequality absolutely applies everywhere but neither would we say were going to throw out our whole feminist analysis because we are trying to understand a remote indigenous community for well over a year now australians have been told consistently and loudly that we need to fix gender inequality if we are ever to stop domestic violence and not just to respond to it when it happens yet those most convinced know the public remains sceptical partridge wonders why its interesting how much resistance there is were not asking for people to be guinea pigs for this terrible experiment because we think it will work but we cant quite prove it it comes back to the idea that challenging gender is just fundamentally difficult for people to accept theres a backlash to it a lot of that is that people dont want to think about gender they dont want to challenge it question it so it becomes theres no evidence but its actually a resistance to talking about gender and thats what were always up against weve tried to counter that by saying ok ok ok well find the evidence and we have evidence its rarely conclusive there are those who say what evidence there is points in all sorts of other directions if we are serious about ending violence against women its a tussle of politics ideology and for scarce resources a tussle that

perpetrators of domestic abuse will be challenged to change their behaviour by a new scheme that marks a major shift from the victimfocused approach to violence within relationships three social sector organisations are working with police and local authorities in sussex essex and south wales to pilot a project intended to both hold abusers to account for their violence and support them to change their behaviour working on the principle that a reduction in the number of victims can only come through a reduction in the number of abusers the drive project will develop test and evaluate a new model aimed at changing perpetrators behaviour to keep their partners and families safe but campaigners for domestic violence support services have already raised the alarm over the scheme warning that funding for perpetrator programmes should not distract from deep cuts within the sector refuge which provides safe houses for abused women also said it was gravely concerned that such programmes could be prioritised over victim services drive is the product of a partnership between respect the main uk organisation working with domestic violence perpetrators safelives a charity dedicated to tackling domestic abuse and the nonprofit financier social finance it was developed in the latters impact incubator unit which brings together organisations to come up with social enterprises for areas deemed to be in acute need of innovation domestic abuse services in the uk have hitherto focused on helping victims escape by helping them to leave and start a new life elsewhere by contrast perpetrators are often left to continue their life as normal and potentially repeat the cycle of abuse with new partners two women a week die as a result of domestic violence with a year judged to be at high risk of murder or serious injury at the hands of their partners or former partners despite that fewer than of abusers receive a specialist intervention to help them change research published last month found that applying a new methodology to crime statistics revealed a hidden rise in violent crime against women that began in and has been fuelled by both domestic violence and violence against women by acquaintances announcing the drive pilot scheme on radio s today programme diana barran chief executive of safelives said drives case managers would coordinate between organisations who can help reform abusers and agencies such as police who can take action against them this project will be driven by safeguarding victims and trying to deal with the most dangerous people whether or not they are currently in the criminal justice system she said because at the moment most of those people are getting neither an opportunity to change nor are they being held to account the point of drive is we are going to do both there is both a carrot and a stick and thats incredibly important because those people who should be in the criminal justice system we are going to need to get them and to get them there solidly mike bedford manager of the domestic violence perpetrators programme at splitz an independent charity said such highrisk offenders rarely appeared in his groups which were mainly composed of men who realised they had a problem to tackle we need to work with these men and deal with the cause not the effect he told bbc radio if we just keep moving women away from the situation we are not dealing with the cause and that man may go on to murder in the future however activists from sisters uncut which campaigns against the cuts to domestic violence services were suspicious about the programme and its apparent shift in focus away from supporting victims sarah kwei said this is a clear sign of austerity leading to dangerous and sometimes fatal choices so many councils are nowadays investing in perpetrator programmes because they dont have the resources to provide refuge and then permanent housing to women fleeing they think these perpetrator programmes will save money and prevent domestic violence when actually there is no evidence they work and some evidence they can be more dangerous by encouraging women to stay thinking that something will change and by giving perpetrators a new language to abuse with sandra horley chief executive of refuge questioned whether funding was being taken from existing services she said the womens refuge sector is being decimated refuge has experienced funding cuts to of its services since some of our services have had their funding cut by finding a refuge space is like finding gold dust how can we justify spending money on therapy for perpetrators when terrified and brutalised women and children have nowhere to go horley added domestic violence is not about the actions of individual men it is a social problem helping a handful of perpetrators it is expected that offenders will be asked to take part in the drive programme over the next three years will do nothing to address the root causes of domestic violence domestic violence is all about power and control it is not about managing the perpetrators anger or his drinking problems it is about addressing his need to control his

a new domestic violence initiative drive is being launched in three pilot areas in england and wales it will be aimed at changing the behaviour of perpetrators of violence rather than supporting victims concentrating on the most dangerous of offenders those with the potential to kill the programme will offer onetoone support seeking to help people to address mental health and addiction problems as well as giving practical advice on housing employment and parenting this is thoroughly good news much crucial work over many decades has gone into educating people about the insidious nature of domestic abuse how it traps victims both psychologically and practically leaving them fearful guiltridden and overwhelmed by the idea of trying to escape but even when people do escape a controlling partner will often seek vengeance in its reporting of this story the bbc has focused on rachel williams who was shot in the leg by her husband at her place of work when she left him after years of attacks her former partner then killed himself while williams was in hospital recovering from her wounds her devastated yearold son took his own life too no one is in a better position to understand the issues than williams and her support for the new initiative is admirable public understanding of what used to be known as battered wives syndrome has moved in my lifetime from virtually zero to high but the problem remains pervasive the domestic violence charity safelives which supports the experiment points out that at any time there are around women living with high levels of abuse a miserable longstanding statistic reminds us with baleful regularity that two women die at the hands of domestic abusers each week in england and wales victims are mainly but by no means always women perpetrators are mainly but by no means always men this gender divide polarises debate in an unhelpful way extremists on both sides tend to concentrate on sexual battle lines one side insisting that the problem quite simply is with men generally the other working hard to refute this generalised slur the problem is with certain individuals usually male and thats the approach that drive takes the great hope is that the project will intervene to save lives and minimise individual misery but more important in some respects is the possibility that eventually a pattern in the psychology of perpetrators can be assembled in the way that it has been for victims even this has been a long time coming with the psychological abuse of coercive control that accompanies or precedes violence only recently having become a crime helping victims to remove themselves from danger will always be of paramount importance challenging as that is but its firefighting supporting potential perpetrators and their families to spot warning signs at a very early stage must surely be a big part of any ambitions to tackle the problem at its source this initiative may mark the start of that new direction in

the number of childminders in england has plummeted by in the past five years putting pressure on childcare places and raising costs for working parents according to figures obtained by labour as a result of the drop in numbers labour says there are now fewer childcare places provided by childminders in england and costs for places have risen by since in a further blow the tories flagship childminder agencies scheme intended to be a onestop shop aimed at simplifying childcare for parents and getting more childminders into the profession has failed to get off the ground figures in ofsteds annual report show that just five agencies are registered with ofsted and to date none have childminders signed up with them according to official figures in there were just over childminders by the figure had fallen to a little under the figures are significant because registered childminders will play their part in the provision of the governments increased offer of hours of free childcare the shadow education secretary lucy powell said this is an embarrassing failure from a government that talks the talk on supporting families but continually underdelivers and disappoints childminder agencies were meant to be an innovative solution to help parents manage work and childcare flexibly yet these figures show that the scheme has been a total flop and childminder numbers are plummeting driving up costs and increasing pressure on parents to find a place ministers are wholly failing to ensure parents have access to flexible highquality affordable childcare a conservative spokesman accused labour of scaremongering adding we are lucky to have a childcare market which is wellplaced to begin delivering the hours entitlement the childcare minister sam gyimah said the childcare sector is healthy vibrant and growing with around more childcare places available for parents than in thanks to our reforms more parents than ever before are accessing highquality free childcare and we are doubling that provision for working parents of three and fouryearolds by we will be spending more than bn extra a year on free childcare more than any other government which will incentivise and attract providers to expand as well as save hardworking families up to the professional association for childcare and early years pacey said it wanted better support for childminders to stay in business and efforts to attract more its building blocks survey carried out last year among childcare professionals including childminders found that one in five childminders were not sure they would still be in the business after a year among the issues contributing to the dwindling numbers is the decline in the support and training that childminders receive from local authorities the onus is now on childminders to identify and fund training for themselves training costs have risen substantially with the cost of level courses increasing from in to in other costs including food and heating have also gone up at the same time the challenges of the job have increased with new systems of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities and greater scrutiny from ofsted as a result some childminders may have moved into alternative jobs with less or no business risk such as learning support assistants in schools victoria flint paceys director of communications said many women have traditionally gone into childminding so that they can care for their own children at the same time as others the fact that childminders are unable to claim the free early years entitlement for their own children means that there is less incentive for them to do this if they work in a nursery setting however they can claim the free early years entitlement she added registered childminding will play a vital part in government plans to increase free early education to hours a week pacey is calling for increased support for childminders both to ensure that childminders already in the sector remain in business and to feel confident about their future as well as encouraging new entrants into the profession case study the job has changed so much annette kingsleyscott has been a childminder for years and before that was a teacher she wanted to run her own business and have greater autonomy childminding was a good fit particularly as she was planning to start a family she now has an eightyearold son the job has changed so much she said standards have gone up so much year on year they keep on rising i see it as a good thing but compared with years ago its not the job it wasbut its in the best interests of the children we are now seen on a par with nurseries and other childcare settings but just working on a smaller scale its taken many years for that recognition to come she acknowledged that costs were growing and that that could be offputting for people considering entering the sector training used to be subsidised now she pays for it herself she has public liability insurance and additional car insurance for business purposes and then theres the ofsted inspection roughly every four years its nerveracking its probably the most stressful experience ive had its the fear of god her last ofsted in november was an intensive fourhour inspection looking at every aspect of her work if you fail it within six months you could have lost your business she got outstanding im passionate about my work said kingsleyscott who looks after six children as well as her own son but its a challenging job its not something to go into lightly you have

i am a feminist and i would like to one day break the glass ceiling with a progressive woman who sees class and race as fundamental problems in american society but i dont believe that the divide the hillary clinton campaign has created meets that standard especially not after the destructive political dilemma that clinton campaign surrogates madeleine albright and gloria steinem attempted to create last weekend when they accused young women who support bernie sanders of being insufficiently feminist steinem has since apologized and clinton made excuses for albright as he has repeatedly said bernie sanders is a feminist too and hes the feminist who has my vote i am the executive director of the largest nurses union in the us my members are overwhelmingly female and not by accident we were the first large organization to endorse sanders nurses recognized sanders as one of their own as soon as he got into the race because they like he believe that all people should be treated equally especially when it comes to healthcare regardless of race gender or ability to pay so lets stop the divisive rhetoric young women older women and younger and older men all have lots of reasons to vote for bernie sanders for the democratic nomination and the clinton camp doesnt get to define for us the appropriate way to live up to our feminist ideals the clinton campaign has tried to elevate the importance of gender above all other considerations but if the goal is a woman qua woman then we all should have been delighted with the fine work of former uk prime minister margaret thatcher regardless the harm suffered by so many as a result of her policies were not and we cannot let the wealthy impose a thatcherite economy on america with the next election with the continuing to hold the vast majority of wealth in the us you cannot separate gender from race and class racial and gender discrimination remain very real incredibly widespread societal problems impacting peoples daily lives in myriad ways from law enforcement practices to hiring and promotion opportunities to pay inequities to a profitfocused healthcare system but the sanders campaigns fundamental pitch is for equality in all aspects in social political economic and personal life the mass movement and political revolution that is so intrinsic to the sanders campaign is the only way to successfully combat racial gender and class discrimination sanders has made inequality the center of his campaign doing so has meant saying that a healthcare system that still leaves million people uninsured and tens of millions with crippling medical debt is not good enough it has meant not just saying that we cannot cut social security but that we must expand its benefits it has meant recognizing that the climate crisis as the gravest threat to our collective future it has meant advocating for the most comprehensive program to end inequities in the criminal justice system and mass incarceration it has meant calling for a just humane immigration program and it has meant issuing policy programs that can end the gender bias endemic to our economic system nurses are called upon to show care compassion and community to their fellow humans and in the course of our work advocating for sanders to win the nomination we have found time and again that the people in sanders movement stand together as a compassionate community so i dont plan to vote against clinton because shes a woman but i dont intend to vote for her because i am i have gotten involved in the sanders campaign because he and all of his compassionate analytic and dedicated supporters that i have met calls for genuine equality for all in my mind there has never been a better feminist than bernie sanders in a serious run for the white house even if hes not the female candidate we need more than a symbol in the white house we need someone who wants to accomplish big things for women and will be a warrior for all humanity,2016-02,feminist would like one day break glass ceiling progressive woman see class race fundamental problem american society dont believe divide hillary clinton campaign ha created meet

chris bryant the welsh rugby union can be a force in preventing domestic violence i know nobody loves a spoilsport everyone loves belting out a good oldfashioned song at the rugby and delilah has become an unofficial second national anthem in wales with its rising cadences and its flashy melodrama thousands love shouting she stood there laughing adding ahahaha for dramatic effect many people say they dont even know that its all about killing a woman despite the words i felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more but heres my problem domestic violence kills two women a week in the uk all the charities that work in this field and the police say theres a noticeable spike in the number of domestic violence incidents on international match weekends all too often a first incident that goes unreported or ignored leads to a far more serious second incident which is why i was so proud of the welsh rugby union last year when it ran its not in my name campaign against domestic violence prominent players got the message across and many clubs signed up en masse to the white ribbon campaign but the violence continues women and men nurse bruises lie for their abusive partner when they have to go to aampe and lie again when and if the police come calling thankfully crime is low in my constituency but nearly all the murders in my years as mp for the rhondda have been domestic in two cases the man killed his partner and their child depressingly the most recent statistics suggest that the number of such incidents is on the increase i am not saying that singing delilah incites violence of course not there is no evidence for that nor am i saying it should be banned from the airwaves or that fans should be banned from singing it but with violent crime up by locally i think we in wales and across the uk have to look deep into our souls and ask why the horror of domestic violence continues unabated undoubtedly alcohol and our social glorification of it plays an important part so do attitudes around what it is to be a real man thats why i think it would make a big difference if the wru ran its not in my name campaign every year i also think far better sex and relationship education is needed in all our schools so that people learn other ways of handling powerful emotions delilah comes from an era when the police would refuse even to attend a domestic so i just hope that if people choose to sing it they give a thought to the victims back at home lots of people are indignant that i have raised this i just hope they get equally indignant about domestic violence julie bindel lets use delilah as a brilliant example of how violent men make excuses ban tom joness delilah not on your life i am not defending its existence because it is a good tune but because rather than glamorise violence against women it makes plain what it is really about the first time i clocked on to the fact that delilah was about a man killing his wife because he believed her to have been unfaithful to him was in when i chose that song to sing at my th birthday party karaoke as i read the words on the autocue my heart sank and a handful of feminist friends started heckling justice for women jfw which i cofounded in is best known for its campaigns to challenge the convictions of women who have killed their abusive male partners however we are every bit as committed to exposing the appalling leniency with which the courts often treat cases such as the one that jones sings about for men who kill their partners such as the fictional husband of delilah the defence of provocation which reduces murder to manslaughter if successful is tailormade it can be enough for the defendant to show that they were provoked usually it is claimed by her nagging or alleged infidelity in fact jfw uses the shorthand nagging and shagging to describe these homicides the lyrics in delilah perfectly evoke the excuse made by many men who kill their wives i have sat in murder trials hearing almost exactly she was my woman as she deceived me i watched and went out of my mind these men claim ownership of their partners and more often than not wait until she leaves or attempts to leave before stalking and killing her such men frame themselves as the victim i could see that girl was no good for me but i was lost like a slave that no man could free whenever jfw has defended a woman at trial who has killed her violent male partner we would hear the judge or prosecution ask if she was so terrified of him why didnt she leave i have never once heard a man on trial in a delilah case asked why he didnt leave if she was treating him badly lets use delilah as a brilliant example within popular culture of how violent men make excuses for themselves and blame the victims for their actions hearing these words in the cold light of day could provoke more women into speaking out on behalf of all the reallife delilahs,2016-02,chris bryant welsh rugby union force

my husband and i are in our s with a young child and a baby we have a good loving relationship and my husband is an excellent father and incredibly supportive of me my husband has a close relationship with his brother who lives overseas when our eldest son was a baby my husband took a holiday to visit his brother who at the time was living in india it was my idea as i knew he was missing him and felt he needed a break exactly two years later my husband said he would like to make the same trip again this time i was against it as i felt that it was too expensive and that if he was taking his limited holiday days from work it would be nice to take them with the whole family my husband finally won out and went to india without us for a second time this was just over a year ago his brother has now moved to south america and my husband and i have been talking about going there to see him in early leaving the children with their grandparents it is not a good place to take children however my husband has now said that he would like to visit his brother in south america this spring i couldnt go as i am still breastfeeding and would not leave the children yet i have made it clear that i feel very unhappy about this but my husband thinks i am being unreasonable he is now freelance so has more flexibility on holiday dates meaning he could also holiday with us later in the year we can also afford the trip financially as he is earning better money now i just cant help feeling that it is unfair of my husband to want to take regular holidays without his wife and children he thinks i am being unreasonable and that it is the norm i cant see how we can get around this he has already said that he wants to be able to visit his brother regularly wherever he is living without being made to feel bad about it i feel resentful as i could not envisage taking expensive longhaul trips away from my family and dont see why he should do this so regularly either i am worried that if he goes i wont be able to forgive him but that if he doesnt go he will resent me and feel trapped and stifled am i being unreasonable i feel confused part of me wants to be cool with this and i dont know why i have such a problem with it lots of people go away on business for chunks of time leaving their partners and children at home its what you decide is acceptable as a family that is important its wonderful that your husband is so close to his brother in fact there are lots of positives in your letter i wondered if you could work out what it is thats really upsetting you is it the fact that he wants to go on these trips at all which you cant control or the length of the jaunts or is it that you feel trapped at home and need a break but feel you cant take one your children are still very young youve got a babe in arms and those first few years are very intense any imbalance between partners perceived or imagined can take on enormous proportions but it wont always be like that as your children grow you will be called to deal with sibling injustices and will probably find yourself saying that being fair doesnt always mean having the same thing at the same time i think that is pertinent here your husband does feel able to go away from his family while you dont but a time will come when you can do more of what you want whatever that may be maybe not farflung holidays your thing may be different but you do need to attend to your own needs even if only occasionally to begin with because that is really important as a parent your supportive husband can help you with this what do you need now to make this a bit more ok for you do you struggle when your husband is away it would be great if he didnt want to go away but he does you could of course put your foot down and im sure there will be plenty of people to call him selfish but that doesnt really help to move the situation forward if you made him stay home hed either resent you or he may go and youll resent him and resentment really is an emotion best dissolved and not left as an eclipsing whole it might also help if you look at your own children and imagine how lovely it would be if they are still so close as adults that they would travel the world for each other let him go away but make sure you know what it is that you want and make sure you get it so that the seesaw of your relationship isnt too

more than a third of adults seeking assistance from homeless services say they are fleeing domestic violence a study by the australian institute of health and welfare has shown but experts say the real figure could be much higher the study published on wednesday analysed the reasons people went to specialist homelessness support services between and it comes as australian of the year david morrison warned australia not to become complacent about domestic violence saying australia risked becoming a nation of bystanders over what he described as the greatest social challenge the country faced morrison has pledged to continue the work of the former australian of the year rosie batty in raising campaigning for services for domestic violence victims statistics released at the end of battys tenure showed the number of women accessing domestic violence services had increased in the past decade and particularly in the past months according to the institute of the people who sought help from a homelessness service in three years covered by the study about or listed family or domestic violence as their main reason for needing housing support of that group almost were adult women were adult men and the rest were children who usually accompanied a single mother about identified as aboriginal or torres strait islander despite aboriginal and torres strait islander people making up just of the population just of people made homeless by domestic violence were settled into longterm accommodation by service providers in the first instance indigenous women single women under the age of and men were the least likely to be given secure housing a domestic violence researcher prof kelsey hegarty said the survey highlighted a critical shortfall in longterm housing that contributed to particularly women and children remaining in unsafe environments in many instances a woman stays in an abusive relationship because of the lack of access to affordable housing hegarty said its one of the barriers to leaving an abusive relationship i certainly know women who have returned to their household they have returned to get security for themselves and their children hegarty said it was particularly concerning that young women were less likely to get secure accommodation because they were more vulnerable to sexual assault or unsafe sexual encounters if in unsafe accommodation unless a person has secure housing you cant address their physical and mental health needs you cant look at healing what happened to them dr heather holst the deputy chief executive of launch housing which provides housing support to people a year in melbournes northern and southern suburbs said courts were increasingly ruling that the victims of family violence be allowed to stay in the family home while the perpetrator leaves but said that did not necessarily solve the problem you may be able to stay in a house that you can no longer afford to pay the mortgage or the rent for she said and the danger for men is that they will try and return as well and if they are the person who is using the violence they can make it really unsafe they can get into more legal trouble themselves single people both men and women often had more difficulty getting secure longterm accommodation because they had less income than parents who can access family support payments you likely have only newstart or a disability pension at most to work with she said if you have children you probably have a higher income if you are just relying on welfare there are more than people on the public housing waiting list for victoria in states like western australia where the queue is about people the average wait time is three years in some suburbs it can be as long as years holst said in some cases the private rental market was the best option but that depended on people having a sufficient income stream and preferably a rental history according to the study only of women and of men who were fleeing domestic violence were employed although rates of employment were higher for those groups than for those homeless for another reason however victims of family violence were more likely than people who were homeless for other reasons to have requests for shortterm accommodation met with getting access to some kind of temporary accommodation there are very few people who dont receive some sort of assistance or support or at least a referral said tim beard a spokesman for the institute the turn away rates are relatively low beard said it was the first time the institute had analysed multiple years of homelessness data he said it was possible the results included a mix of victims and perpetrators but added we think the vast majority are victims because the vast majority are

be treated as such valizadeh has previously written that he believes rape should be legal under certain circumstances arguing that this will encourage women to protect themselves more and eliminate

sexual abuse and sexual violence awareness week which aims to generate discussion about rape and abuse among the general public statutory bodies and third sector organisations a spokesperson for the weeks organisers said it is important for everyone who has been affected by sexual abuse and sexual violence to be aware that as a country we will be having a public discussion about sexual abuse and sexual violence perpetrators also need to know that these discussions are taking place it is time to put the topic at the forefront of a national conversation to promote specialist services that many organisations are offerings the focus is going to be on the fact that all forms of sexual abuse and sexual violence are unacceptable and survivors should not have to tolerate it there should also be

sarah ryman a mother of two schoolage children is well aware of the high cost of going on holiday at peak times we would typically have to spend about on an allinclusive weeks holiday abroad in the summer and we cant afford to do that every year said the marketing consultant from brighton her experience echoes that of many parents for whom an affordable break during the school holidays is a pipedream there may be some relief in sight for sarah and her husband rob as brighton and hove city council is considering adapting the school term timetable to make holidays cheaper for local families the citys schools are now being informally consulted about the best way to do this the cost of holidays varies hugely between the weeks when children are in school and the weeks when they have their halfterm and summer holidays in some cases by more than according to a survey by the observer a weeks holiday for a family of four in a twobed apartment in the spanish island of gran canaria costs during the february halfterm compared with for the same apartment a week earlier a ski break in the french alps will come in at for halfterm but a week earlier the price is just in the uk a twobed woodland lodge in the center parcs resort of whinfell forest cumbria is priced at for the week beginning february but only the previous week an increase of the sharp difference in prices means that holidays are simply not within the budget of some families prompting calls for more flexible school holidays a recent survey of parents by halifax found that almost one in four cant afford a summer holiday at all in brighton one option under consultation is to coordinate inset days school training days which take place on dates decided by the council into a block to create a long weekend or even a full weeks break at a time when holidays are less expensive perhaps in march another option is to reduce the summer break and create an additional stand alone weeks holiday potentially during october or november i often hear people saying the sixweek summer holiday is too long and also that the autumn term is too long councillor tom bewick said if schools are amenable to the councils idea more concrete consultations with schools and parents will then begin with a final decision expected in the summer the news was welcomed by the department for education along with abta the travel association which for years has been calling for local authorities in different regions of the uk to spread out school holidays at the moment parents are a captive market driving demand for breaks during the school holidays which in turn pushes up prices said sean tipton an abta spokesman stagger the school holidays and you spread demand that will enable parents to take advantage of cheaper prices under the current structure academies foundation voluntary aided and foundation special schools have the power to set their own term dates while local authorities are responsible for setting term dates for community and voluntary controlled schools we encourage local authorities to listen sympathetically to arguments for changes to term dates a spokesperson for the department for education said however tipton says an ad hoc approach by individual schools and councils is not the solution stagger school holidays in a structured way by region as they do in germany and the date changes are less likely to be a problem for parents who work at different local schools to the ones their children attend and also parents with one child at primary school and another at secondary school it would also enable local airlines to ensure enough aircraft are available at local airports craig langman chairman of campaigning group parents want a say is against staggering school holidays many parents cannot simply take time off work during allocated school holiday periods they need the flexibility to take the children out of school for up to days a year at time that suits their work schedule if demand for family holidays becomes more strategically spread out across the year it is also likely to increase offpeak prices for other travellers tipton admitted you cant win can you but those travellers would then have the option of going away in july and august for less kate stinchcombegillies an independent travel industry commentator thinks staggering school holidays by regions wouldnt have a significant impact on current offpeak prices the peakseason price period might get slightly longer with an overall reduction in low season weeks sarah and rob ryman would welcome any move to spread out the school holidays and make them cheaper for families i estimate wed save at least a year if the council created a weeks holiday at an offpeak time sarah said parents have less money than people without kids it would be fairer if demand were more spread out plus travelling abroad and experiencing different cultures is such an important educational experience for children sarah added were selfemployed and sometimes weve had to take the kids on holiday during termtime when its cheaper and fits in with our businesses we did this when we went to australia to visit my sister and saved on the flights alone we should have paid a fine but luckily our school didnt report us what the law says guidance from the department for education issued to schools since september states headteachers no longer have any discretion to approve absences of up to days a year in special circumstances unless it is under exceptional circumstances such as a funeral each parent who deliberately takes a child out of school during term time can be fined by their local council this means a family of four two parents taking two children out of school faces a potential fine of this must be paid within days or it doubles according to wwwgovuk the official government website you may be prosecuted if you dont pay the fine after days however huw lewis the welsh education minister has written to all local education authorities in wales advising them that blanket bans on termtime holidays are contrary to welsh education regulations emphasising that headteachers can still legally exercise their discretion in relation to authorising absences for up to days per year in october a father who refused to pay the fine allowed his case to go to court risking a criminal record he was prosecuted under section of the education act which states that parents are liable for the fine if their children fail to attend regularly at school but successfully argued that taking a child out of school for a single week did not mean he had broken the law the ruling however did not set a legal precedent donna ferguson,2016-02,sarah ryman mother two schoolage

if you havent lived through it it can be hard to understand the powerful urge many victims feel to deny weve been raped its almost inherently an invisible dynamic legible only when you already speak the language of silence only hours after my own assault i remember telling the people who were trying to help me to leave me alone that it was no big deal and i just wanted to sleep the first person to tell me i was gangraped was a therapist seven years after the fact is how novelist jessica knoll put it in an essay this week thats been burning up the internet knoll is the author of last summers hot beach read luckiest girl alive which tells the story of ani who suffers a gang rape in boarding school and doesnt speak of it for years knolls beautifully raw missive published on tuesday in lena dunhams lenny letter serves as a comingout of sorts an acknowledgement that her character knows things about rape because knoll herself does the impulse to deny or not acknowledge your own rape isnt just about the horror of the physical violence though someone invading your sovereign body is in fact an ineffable horror but more than that the impulse to deny your own rape is an impulse born of the cultural meaning of victimhood i didnt want to be one of those victim girls is a thing more than one survivor has told me i laughed because laughing was easier than tending to my heart which felt like a hot coal in my chest on fire with shame is how knoll put it shame is the key word it unlocks a constellation of secondary violences that we use to punish rape victims knoll was publicly slutshamed by peers and even a teacher one of the guys who raped her made her feel bad enough about using that word that she apologized to him and recanted the public treats rape victims as alternately pathetic and scheming but either way suspect too dumb to avoid getting drugged and used but clever and vindictive enough to coordinate an elaborate group lie just because we dont like some guy thats the conclusion a judge seems to have come to in the case of canadian radio star jian ghomeshi who has been accused by more than women of brutal and nonconsensual violence in the midst of sexual encounters four counts of sexual assault and one count related to an accusation of choking were brought against him he was acquitted of all charges one of the reasons cited by judge william horkins was the fact that some of the women stayed in touch with ghomeshi after the alleged assaults happened this he felt was out of harmony with the way he thought rape victims should behave all those women did was what knoll did what i did at least at first what so many victims do whose names we may never know they decided probably subconsciously that it was better to deny the violence already done to them than to acknowledge it in a culture that dehumanizes victims at every turn given what happened when they did come forward they were painted as liars their sex lives examined in the national media and now there are calls for them to be tried for perjury its hard to say they were wrong the trouble is that denying rape doesnt unrape you it doesnt ease the trauma or blunt the impact of the violation it doesnt even protect you from the shame youre running from the shaming of rape victims is just an extension of the pervasive shaming of women for having bodies for our wanting to control them to feel safe in them to feel pleasure in them even when we treat victims even male victims as too pathetic to have prevented their own violation we are saying you are weak like women are inherently weak you are worthless like women are inherently worthless and when we treat survivors who speak up as traitors and liars we are saying how dare you object how dare you take up space how dare you insist on your humanity in explaining why shes coming forward with her story now after all these years of denial knoll writes of the power of seeing so many people critics and editors publicists and hollywood executives as well as legions of fans acknowledging anis violation and by the transitive property knolls violation for what it was rape everyone is calling it rape now theres no reason i shouldnt say what i know theres no reason to cover my head shes speaking about her own story of course we have far to go before the same can be said about the culture at large but shes also telling us something

the cost of childcare forms a large part of the vast london poverty picture yet too often goes unseen everyone speaks up for the london living wage affordable housing enjoys star billing in the capitals political debate but the financial strains and human dilemmas tied up with the price of a nursery place or paying a childminders fee command far less attention than they should the single parent charity gingerbread is trying to put that right with a new report on how londons childcare economics make it harder for in particular young women with preschool age children to hold down jobs and a suggestion for how the next mayor could help gingerbread proposes that the mayor gets the greater london authority gla to pay the deposits nurseries and childminders typically require because these upfront costs can deter single parents from getting into work or oblige them to borrow from family members friends or lenders in order to meet them its a proposal aimed at a specific element of what gingerbread calls the affordability challenge facing single parents in london where childcare costs are much higher than in the rest of the country and around half the children in the citys single parent families are defined as living in poverty a nursery place for a child under the age of two devours on average about half of what remains of a single parents income after she its usually a she or he has met her or his housing costs according to gingerbreads analysis of department for work and pensions data employment rates among single parents as a whole have risen faster in london than in the rest of the uk over the past five years and now almost match the national figure of but this masks the lack of progress among parents of children of preschool age of whom only are in work childcare costs also contribute to many single parents working fewer hours than they would like to gingerbread calculates that in one in six london single parents was underemployed in that sense they produce some individual case studies to make the point mila from enfield told them if i want to go back to work full time i would i have to pay nursery costs and for me its too expensive it would cost me per month so i only paid for two days per week and will only be returning to work parttime even then i have had to borrow money from my family for childcare as it still costs me per month then theres ife from southwark so ive scaled back my hours to hours per week because i know what the financial implications of having to work mean in terms of childcarei also know that come the sixweek school summer holidays im going to have to give up my job because i will not be able to afford the childcare costs gingerbread sets such stories in the context of what it terms the complex childcare funding puzzle which includes gains resulting from recent government investment in childcare such as a universal entitlement to hours of early years education for three and four year olds snd some disadvantaged two year olds counteracted by the tightening of eligibility criteria for hours of childcare provision which gingerbread says will cause single parents in london to lose out high childcare costs in london outstrip the support available through the tax and benefits system the report says there are now nine london local authorities where the average cost of parttime childcare for a child under two exceeds the maximum support available through tax credits the value of which has not been revised in over a decade some candidates for city hall have to their credit recognised and addressed the childcare issue liberal democrat caroline pidgeon the mother of a two yearold son and formerly southwark councils cabinet member for children and young people he has first hand knowledge of the problems of finding the right type of childcare arrangement the hours available from most childcare providers dont allow you to work the hours you need she said interviewed here she

city hall contains a promise in the business prosperity and opportunity section to make childcare more affordable and accessible with a strategy that delivers for business and workers including key worker status for childcare workers and campaigning for business rate relief for childcare providers in a speech in january he said he would establish a commission to report on childcare across the capital saying that it is a matter of both social justice and economic failure that its high costs limit the ability of many women to reenter the workforce sophie walker candidate of the womens equality party identifies what she calls maternal unemployment as a major issue for london underlining childcare costs as a major part of this and arguing for a shift in the capitals employment culture to allow more flexible and parttime working allowing londoners to more easily reconcile working and parenting she argues that the exclusion of women from the labour market deprives the capitals economy of their skills and would aim to make affordable childcare available for all children from nine months including by helping boroughs make a better job of fulfilling their duties under the childcare act as part of a broader strategy to combat poverty in his blueprint for business see page the conservatives zac goldsmith says he will lobby government to ensure that its promised free

the royal commission into family violence was asked to identify how to prevent family violence support victims make perpetrators more accountable make systemic changes in responding to family violence and look at how to coordinate services better it was to make practical recommendations to get all this done in just over months the commission has delivered a comprehensive thorough detailed ambitious report that answers its brief in a way that is impossible to pick apart as the commissioner marcia neave said its all interlinked one recommendation is dependent on others and all the parts of the family violence system rely on all the other parts to work well the ad hoc poorly funded triage system of responding to family and domestic violence some good ideas here some failings there doesnt work if we are serious about stopping family violence from happening in the first place and properly protecting victims when it does happen our system she said needs to be transformed the financial cost of implementing all recommendations and the victorian premier daniel andrews instantly said he would do just that will be enormous one critique of the commission might be that it did its job so thoroughly that it came to think that this one issue was the most important of all overlooking the realities of competing demands on governments but perhaps the commissioners were being honest its recommendations will have substantial funding implications for government the report says that means it must be a high priority for departments not just programs that exist at the margins of portfolios the commissioners knew what this meant it may require investigating options for redirecting existing revenue sources towards family violence expenditure away from other priorities presumably it might even mean identifying new revenue sources andrews wouldnt bite when asked if a new tax might be needed but he didnt rule it out either the commission made clear that if the victorian and australian communities really want to change the horrific domestic violence story then it wont come without transforming systems and it wont come without spending what andrews acknowledged will be hundreds of millions of dollars the reports message was clear there is no other way it recommended short medium and longterm solutions for a start there needed to be a big injection of funds for domestic violence services breaking under the strain of demand an rise in police callouts for family violence incidents in the five years to june were being handled without a similar rise in funds there also needed to be a housing blitz to deal with the lack of accommodation for victims fleeing abusive relationships and to end adhoc accommodation in motels rooming housing and caravan parks because there is nothing else available then the report outlined longerterm solutions services were poorly coordinated so victims did not know where to go for help or had to tell their stories over and over again there would be support and safety hubs basically onestop shops for all kinds of services from crisis accommodation risk assessment help with alcohol abuse and mental health problems and perpetrator programs that would be made easier by information sharing between agencies that would be funnelled through to the hubs it has been a problem in the past that for privacy reasons agencies have been unable to pass on information to other organisations these barriers make victims unsafe and help perpetrators fly under the radar neave told a media conference this commissions view is that privacy should not trump victim safety the courts would be transformed too within five years all victims would have family violence matters heard in a specialist court with specialist magistrates dedicated police prosecutors and support workers safe waiting rooms would be provided separate entry and exit points for applicants and respondents and within three years courts must allow a family violence victim to give evidence remotely if they wished to do so the report stressed a whole of government and a whole of community response and it fleshed out what that meant public hospitals would be resourced to implement their response to family violence all local councils must report on measures they were taking to respond to the needs of victims gps should have mandatory family violence training more funds should be provided for programs for perpetrators after a review into what worked police would trial body cameras when responding to incidents to make collecting evidence easier there would be routine screening for family violence in public antenatal sites utilities companies and banks will be told to help family violence victims struggling with their bills and financial hardship there are little things that the report says matters victoria will ask the federal government through the coag process to consider a specific family violence medicare item number to provide support distinct from the current gp mental health treatment plan it wants the federal government to include family violence as a specific ground for financial hardship payments to prevent family violence in the long run the commission largely supported the idea that gender inequality was the key it recommended an expansion of respectful relationship programs in every public school from prep to year nothing was forgotten the government should allow that family violence might be a circumstance entitling a person to have a traffic fine withdrawn it should provide as much counselling as needed and assistance with mortgages and rents if required overarching all this was a state year plan to tackle family violence none of this would work the report said unless there was transparency and accountability andrews agreed to a bipartisan standing parliamentary committee on family violence and a cabinet standing subcommittee chaired by him above all that was a statutory family violence agency to monitor and report on the implementation of the commissions recommendations andrews gave the impression when responding to this report that he wants this issue to be his legacy he didnt flinch at any of it and he didnt seem to worry much about the money the first investment would come in next months state budget the failures of the past were not those of the family violence sector he insisted but of political leadership yes it would require hundreds of millions of dollars but the cost of family violence was too high people died in victoria at the hands of partners or former partners last year i refuse to look back in years time and admit that we could have done more to save innocent lives we will get this right he said this is everybodys problem it is unacceptable and it changes today that remains to be seen but nobody could say the commission failed to do its job it even came in under budget surely one of the only royal commissions ever to do so this was always a different royal commission focused not on blame or establishing whether there was a problem everyone acknowledged there was but what to do about it it has delivered its solutions now it is up to governments state and federal and for all of us to get on with it,2016-03,royal commission family violence wa asked identify prevent family violence support victim make

last december while the rest of my office was settling into its christmas lunch i was singing wind the bobbin up instead of an afternoon of drunken shouting i was sitting with a circle of new mums at a music group in our local community centre belting out an irritating song to a room of babies who have no clue about bobbins or any other part of the textile industry i know i was meant to be enjoying the moment but in truth i was wondering why on earth id taken shared parental leave spl following the birth of my second daughter nina in september spl was introduced in april as a way to give fathers more time to bond with their babies and to ease expectations on mothers instead of the traditional weeks of maternity leave and two weeks of paternity leave new parents could now share up to weeks between them more and more fathers want to play a handson role with their young children but too many feel that they cant said the then deputy prime minister nick clegg introducing the scheme thats an edwardian system that has no place in stcentury britain spl already the norm in nordic countries was billed as an unequivocal step towards gender equality a year on it isnt working the government wont evaluate the policy until but a study by the employee benefits organisation my family care found that just of companies have seen a significant uptake of spl financial considerations cultural restraints and a lack of awareness have all been blamed i was the first man in my company to take spl im still the only man in my company to have taken it i dont think that makes me a better dad than anyone else i certainly didnt have feminist motivations for taking time off work i figured i could be paid to come into the office or i could be paid to stay at home also my wife alice and i arent planning any more children this opportunity wont come along again im lucky i work for a progressive employer the majority of hr directors interviewed by my family care said that taking leave could be frowned upon or career limiting but i never felt this though my hr department struggled with the logistics the paperwork is complicated they were encouraging and helpful we elected to share ninas first three months with alice taking a further six months off once i returned to work in january this was mainly for financial reasons i would only get my full salary if i used my spl during the first weeks but ninas birth coincided with our first daughter robin starting school fantastic parental planning there we really blew the kids world apart so i could be there for her too shared parental leave can however be split in any number of ways parents can take it in turns or be off for weeks together while earning weeks of statutory pay between them or of earnings whichever is lower as a nation our attitudes to family life have changed mothers have been the driving force of social change across the last years moving in unprecedented numbers into paid work as the cost of living increases fathers spend more time with their children than their fathers did and more than their fathers did before them theres been a huge shift even in the last years says jeremy davies of think tank the fatherhood institute in the percentage of british people who believed in what youd call a traditional model where the dad is the breadwinner and the mum is a carer was only if you look at the youngest people the to yearolds surveyed its just but these attitudes have yet to translate into realities this month a report found that women still take on more than twothirds of the childcare duties in the uk and do nearly four weeks a year more unpaid work in the home than men ireland was the most unequal of the countries studied by the overseas development institute with men doing just of childcare less than in iraq a recent article in harvard business review based on interviews conducted with nearly american male and female executives suggested that men still regard family issues as primarily a female concern when presented with worklife conflicts men were unreticent about choosing work the report found because they see their main role as that of breadwinner even if thats no longer true despite the grooviness of being a handson dad as suggested by various male celebrities i did the first nappy its a badge of honour prince william you need to get a bit of shit on your hands rio ferdinand i actually like being with my children nick clegg the majority of mums still do the majority of childcare when you become a parent you suddenly find yourself back in the s says jeremy davies the disparity between maternity leave and paternity leave in the uk is the biggest in the developed world men get two weeks and women get what does that say to everybody about whos responsible for kids all the evidence shows that paternity leave helps society too if fathers take parental leave their families are more likely to stay together even if there is a separation the father is more likely to remain involved with the children they tend to achieve higher marks at school be better adjusted and have greater selfconfidence meanwhile women are likely to do better at work all the evidence shows that paternity leave encourages bonding and sets a pattern for being more involved in childcare says justine roberts ceo of mumsnet whose own survey found that nearly a fifth of fathers took just five days or fewer of paternal leave in the long run if taken widely it could go a long way towards addressing the motherhood penalty the phenomenon of womens careers and pay taking a nosedive after children ah yes that another recent survey this one by the law firm slater amp gordon found that female employees increasingly suffer from discrimination at work when they get pregnant and are often made redundant while on maternity leave one in seven of those surveyed had lost their job when they took time off to have a baby and said their jobs had changed when they went back to work more than a th found they had been replaced by the person who covered their maternity leave it feels hard to argue with the biology it may take two people to make a baby but youd be an idiot to claim equal parenting status with someone whod done hours labour and is now breastfeeding on spl id sometimes invent a shopping trip or a task to do just so id look busy while alice had a nap or fed nina the eu tried to take a dispassionate look at all this says jeremy davies and they reckoned the first six weeks of maternity leave is basically about the femaleonly stuff recovery from the birth and establishing breastfeeding anything after that is basically lookingafterchildrentime and that doesnt have to be focused on women and arguably shouldnt be indeed the qualities required to care for babies meticulous preparation strength of mind ability to clean up nurturing are not intrinsically female dont dwell too much on breastfeeding only of families do it for the full six months recommended by the world health organisation in sweden a scheme to introduce paid breastfeeding time where nonworking dads can deliver babies to working mums for feeds has collapsed in logistical chaos the mumsnet survey found that of the sites users would like dads to take more parental leave so why hasnt spl taken off money is certainly one reason because men still tend to be the higherearning partner they face a financial penalty for being off work selfemployed women and nonworking women arent eligible for spl also the way its set up is that spl still runs as maternity leave by default its up to the mother to give this right to the father and thats perceived as the mothers loss says dr jana javornik senior lecturer at the university of east london who researches care labour and equalities issues across europe there are also ingrained cultural issues to fight against dr emma banister is a senior lecturer in consumer research at manchester business school shes coleading a project called making room for dads which is following new fathers as they embark on spl lots of employers seem to have been putting their heads in the sand just hoping that no one comes forward so most men have felt like guinea pigs like the policy is being formed around them she says at least one participant has had a comment made to him by a woman at his work god i wouldnt be prepared to give up my maternity leave that positioning is quite interesting patrick gilbert is a human resource consultant the uk law has a nod and a wink saying oh well sure youre fathers youre entitled to paternity leave but i dont get the sense that its working that way in practice he says for a lot of people who are upwardly mobile in their career youre definitely making a sacrifice on your own career progression while i didnt experience any negatives from my work i do get the odd comment from senior staff to the effect of you took half of last year off comments i cant imagine being directed at my female colleague who went off to have her baby at the same time as me gilbert has seen both sides of it years ago he spent six months splitting childcare with his working partner i approached the task like a typical male arsehole he says i thought this cant be nearly as bad as mothers make it out to be i made my list of things to do the kitchen floor needs to be cleaned then i have to go grocery shopping and make a meal fucking hell at the end of the day i thought i cant stand this i really dont like it i dont find anything good about it im exhausted and i really havent accomplished very much i love my kids but there were times when i felt i couldnt wait to get back to work the other problem javornik sees is a lack of role models for men i think what fathers really miss is the message that this is acceptable when dads who are in the public eye have taken paternity leave general opinion has not been positive former energy secretary ed davey took paternity leave when his daughter was born in february a time which unfortunately coincided with freak storms that left thousands of homes without power he was pilloried in some areas of the press despite remaining in daily contact with the office there is openmouthed disbelief that he has just downed tools and gone a whitehall source was quoted as saying at the time a less helpful public figure was kensuke miyazaki who made headlines earlier this year for promoting womens rights when he became japans first male politician to take paternity leave six days before his wife gave birth he was caught having an affair with a professional kimono dresser and had to resign conservative mp for west suffolk matthew hancock took time off in im taking two months paternity leave boasts tory business minister according to the daily mail it was unusual says hancock it was more difficult than i expected and i ended up doing an awful lot of work from home but i wanted to do it because i believe in being an active father i also want to see a change in culture where it becomes normal for men and women to take time off when they have very young children the goal is that theres no bias in recruitment either way new policies always take time to become part of a culture and other countries have managed to make spl the norm what were working against is a normative pattern that says youre not a good mother if you go back to work before your child reaches a certain age says javornik in the uk men are really shy of asking but women dont help we saw this years ago when spl was introduced in sweden and slovenia those countries have subsequently introduced a quota for each parent with a use it or lose it proviso unless you introduce it as an individual right the takeup wont be that high javornik says which is what were seeing in the uk now there could be one other reason why spl hasnt caught on here men dont want to take it i know lots of people of my generation who are desperate to get more involved but the rules prevent them reckoned nick clegg is he right i think the big unspoken thing is that in their heart of hearts a lot of men dont want to be very heavily involved in bringing up their children because its too much hard work says john oconnell a journalist and author we all know men who have no involvement whatsoever or who occasionally turn up at the schoolgates and make a huge deal of it daddys here those men who develop elaborate exercise routines they have to do every weekend im going for my bike time otherwise i cant function i cant do my job yes you can oconnell is admittedly biased he provides the greater share of childcare to his two daughters since his partners job involves long hours and weekends away id always been fairly involved but i think you have to see it in terms of a family gestalt its not about your careermy career it rapidly became obvious that cathys career was on a totally different trajectory to mine and rather than being jealous and macho my response was ok thats whats happening lets see how we can make it work lets see how its possible for you to do that career as well as you possibly can my career is going to be very secondary and actually thats fine women have been taking a back seat for years so that men can have fantastic careers he cites emma watson and her promotion of the uns heforshe campaign in terms of celebrity engagement that was really important feminism isnt going to work unless men get on board with it but davies thinks that some feminist groups might actually have affected the current low uptake of spl the original plan for spl had more in common with the icelandic system three months to the mother three months to the other parent and three months as agreed between parents but this collapsed it got pulled down by pressure from feminist groups ironically saying youve got to keep maternity leave as it is its sacrosanct javornik is more encouraging to a point spl represents a huge policy milestone by taking a symbolic step to enable working fathers to take a more active role in caring for their children she says but the new legislation has done little to enshrine shared parenting as a societal ideal what is needed is a route to recognising in law the value of parenting this first year may have been a bit of a shaky start but i would recommend spl to anyone not only because this is the only way that we can change perceptions of what being a father is but also because its unmissable as a man what youre used to hearing before you have a kid is how much worse off your life is going be how all the fun is going to stop and how your social life christmas meals and all will vanish thats all true but what few men fess up to is the overwhelming wave of love that begins the day your baby is born and only gets stronger thats got to be worth missing work for even if it does mean joining in with the mums on wind the bobbin up johnny davis is deputy editor of esquire the mothers view all kids really want is your time and thats what johnny gave nina and robin by alice fisher memories of my first maternity leave all hum with anxiety when she was three weeks old my daughter robin developed an abscess in her chest and it took two operations to drain it the day she was discharged from hospital my fatherinlaw announced he had terminal cancer two months later my mother was admitted to a psychiatric unit when the paranoia induced by her escalating dementia became uncontrollable as johnny and i became parents we lost our own there was no sense of family growing or bonding no advice we spent the first year of robins life feeling like we could neither celebrate nor complain two things most new parents love to do ive been asked if i suffered postnatal depression and the answer is i dont know i was certainly depressed but wouldnt you have been luckily you cant spend time with robin without enjoying yourself wed still had brilliant times while i was on maternity leave so i was looking forward to being with nina our number two but i was surprised when johnny announced he wanted to do spl johnny is that tosser at the next table in your favourite restaurant who checks his email all through his meal hes missed my birthday and robins for work when she had the abscess he only agreed to cancel a trip to new york when a second incision and drainage had to be scheduled id like to say that i dont resent his dedication but of course i do though i admire it too a babys first weeks are the most basic days of parenthood its all breastfeeding and dirty bums and bawling for hours and hours there are never enough hands to hold a newborn so having a constant wingman was great nina refused to take a bottle so we couldnt share feeding which meant he could continue his irritating tradition of checking his emails while other people tried to eat i hadnt thought how weird it would be to continually hang out with johnny i mean i like the guy but that face every day sometimes it felt like one of those bank holiday mondays when you wake up with great intentions some diy a gallery go out for a meal but then you have a row over breakfast and sabotage the day on other days wed talk for hours while we wandered with the pram the garbled conversation of the sleep deprived i learned odd things about him he doesnt know the plot of macbeth he hasnt seen blade runner and hes never heard of the muffin man who lives on drury lane he honestly thinks he can recreate derek jarmans garden on our tiny balcony was shared parental leave worth it absolutely johnny jiggled nina while she cried for a colicky six hours every night every night can you believe it he built cardboard robots with robin and took her swimming so that nina and i could nap he helped with housework and even occasionally said he enjoyed it i think we both felt shellshocked the first time round due to family circumstance but shared parental leave showed us that there was no special talk we missed out on from our own parents there doesnt have to be a handing on of the baton the two of us can look after the children and do a pretty good job all they really want is your time and thats what johnny gave nina and robin putting in the time made me think about the hour rule that all it takes to be a genius in any field is to practise for hours its pertinent to childcare and accounts for mothers intuition i know when my children are ill hungry or tired because ive spent so much time with them by taking three months off with nina and robin johnny has clocked up an extra hours of childcare so hes not quite a genius but i think its helped him be a good father,2016-03,last december rest office wa settling christmas lunch wa singing wind bobbin instead afternoon drunken shouting

i have a yearold sister who is acting out in ways that seem odd she does not have a lot of friends but does have one particular friend who has just got a boyfriend i am and have been away from home since i was i live about two hours away but dont drive so it is hard for me to visit her for a while now she has felt the need to be rude or mean to everyone family and friends she seems angry but not a normal teenage angry i remember being her age i rebelled and did everything you probably were not supposed to do somehow i turned out ok after about the age of my mum would provide all you wanted but the more intimate part is never there my sister has expressed this to me before my mother and stepdad divorced a while ago he now has two babies of his own and is still a huge part of my sisters life my mother remarried as well and is maybe not as involved she is there but a little bit more involved in other things i feel maybe there is some sense of loss in my sister of not belonging i know that is normal for someone her age but the things she says make me worry for example i dont like people yeah i am a mean person so what if they look at me the wrong way ill be meanhit etc it worries me she is already seeing a counsellor but nothing seems to be changing just getting worse do you have any thoughts on how to help i feel as if she hates me our family the world everyone you are very astute and you will probably be your sisters greatest ally during this but although you having been there and done that will give you insight her journey exact circumstances and therefore reactions and acting out are going to be different from yours i think she is really lucky to have you around i contacted helena cowen a child and adolescent psychotherapist childpsychotherapyorguk who immediately picked up on what you also mention the tremendous sense of loss in your sisters life she thinks that probably your sisters friend getting a boyfriend has triggered a sense of loss in your sister first says cowen you have more awareness of your sisters problems than you may realise your sister is dealing with several constellations of family and probably feels cast aside most recently by her friend if you think about the attachment young adolescents have towards their boyfriends it is hard to regulate the feelings its very intense your sister probably feels really left out of her friends life now then we add into that your stepdad remarrying two new children your mother not really being there for the emotional stuff where does your sister live with whom you didnt say and it is not surprising that your sister is so destabilised she is very probably rejecting people because she feels so rejected herself it takes confidence to make yourself vulnerable and confidence comes from feeling secure cowen suggests that you dont panic but allow your sister some time both to find her way through this after all you turned out ok and for the therapy to work therapy can often bring distressing feelings to the surface to begin with she says i would also suggest reaching out to her in whatever way or combination of ways works best and that may change either with regular phone calls letters or skype these points of contact will matter to her even if she doesnt always respond and even if she gets angry she may test you to see if you too will stick around if she is mean you dont have to write reams just let her know you are thinking of her i note you said that it is not easy for you to get to her but i wonder if you could see her every now and again and fix these dates in stone so that she knows she has that to look forward to you know what shes missing says cowen and you can help her to make sense of it and her therapist can help your sister to realise that having those feelings does not make her a bad person that it is possible for her to love her familyfriends but also be very very angry with them cowen says not to forget that adolescence is a very intense time and things are felt very acutely and dont always calm down until your s indeed there is some evidence that the frontal lobe doesnt finish developing until the age of dont forget to have fun with her too says cowen perhaps when you meet up you could do stuff together silly stuff as well as having good chats adolescence can be a hard enough time as it is but your sister sounds a bit at sea as if you said this yourself she doesnt really know where she belongs i wonder if you have spelled it out to her that you also found things tough when you were a similar age but you feel much straighter and calmer now sometimes we all need to know that difficult times will end also remember that teenagers often look as if they are not listening and dont care but they are and they do your problems

when rashida manjoo un special rapporteur on violence against women visited britain in she described a boys club sexist culture that has a negative impact on women throughout the uk now a new report from the equality and human rights commission ehrc suggests that old boys networks are barring women from the boardroom at some of the uks biggest companies the report reveals that more than of the uks largest firms have failed to meet a voluntary target of female board members the problem is particularly acute at executive level with of ftse firms having no women at all in executive posts perhaps the most concerning finding by the ehrc is the fact that during the period fewer than half of the uks largest companies increased their female board representation at all this may be partly explained by the other problem highlighted in the report the method companies are using to find and select new board members nearly a third rely on personal networks rather than publicly advertising such roles suddenly those allmale golfing trips and long lunches take on an extra layer of significance during a time when an increasing number of companies are making loud noises about equality and diversity its frustrating that many still fail to tackle concrete practices such as boardmember selection methods that have a huge and demonstrable impact on the problem what use is it to vaunt womens networks and diversity drives if behind closed doors the important decisions are being made between mates this isnt to say that initiatives focusing on getting more women involved at every level of the workplace arent still a positive step such projects have an important role to play in supporting female employees but they mustnt be used as a figleaf to suggest earnest concern about the issue while doing little in reality to solve it part of the problem is that it tends to be mainly women who are involved in diversity projects and mentoring networks while men at the top are busy making the decisions that have the greatest impact all the brilliant womens networking in the world cant help female candidates if the opportunity to reach the executive board is decided by a group of men calling on those they already know and socialise with it is often suggested that the female workforce themselves should be responsible for fixing their underrepresentation in managerial and executive roles with many companies offering career confidenceboosting workshops or training women in negotiation skills but this puts the blame squarely on womens own shoulders suggesting many simply arent trying hard enough when the ehrc study reveals the real problem may lie elsewhere what use is there in training a woman to negotiate fiercely and put herself forward for a senior role if the top jobs are being handed down from the mostly white male boys club to their mostly white male circles of acquaintances what use are good personal presentation skills if you never get the chance to present your candidacy because the position isnt advertised in the first place the problem of slow progress is not exclusive to women on boards it has been a particularly dispiriting week for women in the uk with separate reports suggesting that progress has also practically screeched to a halt altogether on maternity discrimination and the gender pay gap across all of these areas there is a common truth talking about the issue does not necessarily equate to dealing with it having a diversity programme is fantastic but it doesnt just tick the box and solve the problem such initiatives must be supported with topdown leadership and concrete change on everything from pay transparency to flexible working shared parental leave to real action on harassment the past few years have seen a surge in coverage and awareness of workplace discrimination and inequality but to see real progress we need business bosses to stop talking and take action,2016-03,rashida manjoo un special rapporteur violence

have you experienced discrimination for being pregnant or a mother at work if not it might surprise you to hear that despite the laws in place to protect against this its more common than you might imagine a report by the equalities and human rights commission found that that threequarters of pregnant women and new mothers have experienced prejudice with one in nine women losing their jobs as a result whats more only one in four women affected raised it with their employer mainly because of the high cost of taking a case to a tribunal we asked our readers to share their stories here five women discuss the difficulties they faced while pregnant or after returning to work following maternity leave i was fired when my boss found out i was pregnant i was and had a job in an insurance and wealth management firm i was on a temporary contract sourced from the local recruitment agency it was a busy time we all worked hard there was talk of a move to a permanent role and more specific training with good progression opportunities when i found out i was nearly five months pregnant i told my boss first thing that monday morning my employers seemed supportive and again a quick move to a permanent role was mentioned with a plan to return after maternity leave i was thrilled but then that friday at pm i was called into the office talk turned the other way i hadnt met targets this week there were complaints this was all news to me i was escorted to my desk to collect my things i was told not to come back i was in shock but i was young and naive and i never questioned it they gave the agency a glowing reference not citing any issues as a temporary agency staff member i wasnt legally protected despite two years of service they were completely covered i have heard other similar stories to mine sophia from gloucestershire after maternity leave i was demoted i had been promoted into a directors role prior to announcing my pregnancy but when i told my boss i was pregnant his response was no wonder you wanted to get promoted suggesting he thought it had been part of my plan to secure a higher salary to improve my maternity pay on my return to work after seven months leave i was not allowed to go back to my previous role they had already recruited a man to replace me and i was to report to him and given the responsibilities of a sales manager a role i had held five years previously i was removed from the directors meetings despite still holding a directors title and pay grade their argument for doing this was that i would not be able to focus as much as i needed to on my role as i had to leave at pm two days a week to collect my baby from childcare after six months i was presented with a settlement agreement and asked to leave anonymous from northampton i was told getting pregnant so soon after joining was a setback i became pregnant with my first child five months after starting a new job three months after returning to work following maternity leave the organisation embarked on a restructuring my role was one of six that was going to be made redundant but my team urged the board and director to rethink the proposals which resulted in the director offering me a diminished role in doing so she said that i should be grateful since getting pregnant so soon after joining was a surprise and a setback for them in my current role i have been shocked by the attitude of management towards maternity leave and parenthood for example on being offered my present job which was described as a high octane role with travel opportunities i was asked how as a mother i would cope with this my line manager often held forth his views on maternity leave describing it as damaging to stakeholder relationship building he openly decried the fact that women on maternity leave accrued holidays and pension benefits anonymous from liverpool before maternity leave there was talk of promotion but when i returned it was off the cards i have a phd in science and worked as a research scientist at one of the biggest british companies i was a high flyer and was verbally promised a promotion several times but it didnt happen immediately due to organisational changes a month before i disclosed my pregnancy my boss was very sure about putting me forward for promotion that year and positive about my chances of success before i went on maternity leave i worked very hard right up to the last minute and came back after just six months when i returned nothing was said about my promotion instead everything was stagnant and frustrating i decided to leave and the uk to come to work in scandinavian where there is much more gender parity although there is still not complete equality anonymous from scandinavia colleagues were asked about their plans for children when applying for promotions i am currently pregnant with my first baby i have recently been actively encouraged by my employer to apply for a big promotion that has just opened up they are very supportive about the potential to fasttrack the application before i start maternity leave and to find an intermediate solution to accommodate my being away for months i am very torn between pushing on in my career and taking the opportunity to focus on my family life and not overstretch myself on my return to work next year while working in academia i witnessed colleagues being asked about their plans for children when applying for promotions i left academic science six years ago as the working conditions were not ones where a woman with aspirations for both a career and a family could get on long hours shortterm contracts and pay that was too low to save for a home mandatory hr training for all managers about gender discrimination to prevent them asking about family plans during job interviews would be a move in the right direction as would more support for women who want to challenge their employers when they think they have been discriminated

threequarters of pregnant women and new mothers experience discrimination at work and one in nine lose their job as a result governmentcommissioned research has found the report suggests that pregnancy discrimination which is illegal has risen significantly since when of women said they had experienced such discrimination the research published on tuesday found one in five mothers said they experienced harassment or negative comments in the workplace related to pregnancy or flexible working and one in said they were discouraged from attending antenatal appointments the results which equate to women experiencing discrimination across britain were described as shocking by maternity action the equality and human rights commission echr which commissioned the report with the department for business innovation and skills urged the government to take urgent action to address the problem caroline waters deputy chair of echr said we simply cannot ignore the true scale of the hidden discrimination that working mothers face this is unacceptable in modern britain and urgent action is needed to ensure women are able to challenge discrimination and unfairness this is why we are calling on the government to look at the barriers working pregnant women and mothers face in accessing justice we want to make workplaces fairer for everyone and get rid of outdated practices like asking women during job interviews whether they intend to have children for businesses to thrive they need to harness the talents skills and experience of all employees the survey of more than mothers and employers suggested a number of reasons for the escalating problem including employment tribunal fees of up to introduced in fear of negative repercussions at work lack of information about rights and the stress of making a claim while most employers said it was in their interests to support women who are either pregnant or on maternity leave and that pregnant women and mothers were as committed as other employees a significant minority expressed negative views about a quarter felt pregnancy put an unreasonable cost burden on the workplace and a similar proportion suggested it was reasonable to ask women in job interviews whether they planned to have children threequarters of mothers questioned who were unsuccessful in job interviews felt the employers knowledge of their pregnancy had affected their chances among the ehrc recommendations following on from the report are stronger steps to prevent employers asking in job interviews about a womans pregnancy or her intention to have children it also suggests the government should look at lowering the fees for employment tribunals and explore the feasibility of a collective insurance scheme to help small and medium employers provide enhanced pay and cover for maternity leave as in denmark jo swinson who commissioned the research in when she was minister for employment relations and now chairs maternity action said the findings should be a wakeup call for the government and employers part of the gender pay gap is driven by how women are supported in the workplace around before and after pregnancy so the government should consider extending pay gap reporting to include return rates after maternity leave she said now that we know the shocking scale of the problem the government needs to take swift action to better protect women in the workplace the government said it was too soon to make changes to employment tribunal fees and rejected an increase in the time limit for a claim from three to six months but accepted the ehrcs other recommendations the minister for women and equalities nicky morgan and the business secretary sajid javid said in a joint statement it will take coordinated action from government the ehrc and business at all levels and of all sizes as well as stakeholders to truly tackle pregnancy and maternityrelated discrimination in the workplace and stamp it out for

alexis a yearold attorney at a midsized politically conservative law firm in detroit was working on two deals when a male partner she hadnt met before called her up and asked if she was getting weepy i want to make sure you arent running into elises office crying every morning alexis said he told her is everything ok alexis was stunned and confused she and elise another female associate both names are pseudonyms werent close nor were they working on the same cases there was no indication that anything was wrong with either employee theyd been working hard long hours just like all lawyers at their firm it was this presumption that im not handling it and that my reaction would be to go cry to the other girl up the hall alexis said which i have never heard anyone ask a male associate thats just one example alexis said of how she feels routinely condescended to undercut and devalued in the office especially by her republicanleaning male superiors if you have half a brain as a young female associate you look around and you know there is no path for success alexis said of something partners in her department just three are female according to a new study alexiss experience may not be an outlier female lawyers the study found are promoted less often are less likely to be selected to work on certain client teams and are more likely to leave their law firms when their male superiors are politically conservative and donate to republicans women who work under politically liberal democratdonating bosses dont see the same penalties conservative bosses women report anecdotally are indeed harder to work with and conservative workplaces less favorable to female lawyers professional development most of the challenges dont come in the form of obvious outright discrimination theres little of the madmenstyle assgrabbing or blatant disparate treatment but rather male associates are given subtle advantages in mentorship professional opportunities informal communications and even compensation at alexiss firm the young male associates and the young male partners are on informal email chains and group texts staying in constant communication with each other the more experienced male partners are able to offer the newer lawyers important tips and bits of knowledge about longtime clients something female associates who arent part of the group communications dont get these longstanding relationships yield a lot of institutional knowledge alexis said if you arent privy to this backchanneling information you constantly step on land mines and theres no way you could have known unless someone helped you out and told you decades of institutional knowledge theres not enough effort in the world that can help you overcome that the politics of gender seth carnahan an assistant professor at the university of michigan ann arbor who conducted the survey with brad greenwood an assistant professor at temple university emphasized that the findings are only a correlation not a causation the fact that conservative men in charge meant fewer women promoted and retained could be caused by the bosses or by the employees carnahan said we cannot rule out the idea that women who are more interested in getting ahead in their careers are selecting jobs where theyre working with more liberal male partners he said still the weight of the research on inequality in the workplace suggests that its managers not subordinates who have a strongest hand in pulling women up the career ladder or pushing them down the rungs on the partner side its possible that a partners political ideology might be influencing the culture they create in the organization and also the way they think about the promotion of female associates carnahan said theres a lot of work in political science that suggests a conservative political ideology is associated with relatively traditional views about gender roles indeed according to the general social survey which examines american attitudes and beliefs about a slew of issues conservative men are significantly more likely than their liberal counterparts to say that the best family setup is one in which women stay home with the children and men are the primary breadwinners if youre a woman working for a boss with that perspective its perhaps not surprising that you wouldnt be mentored or that your career wouldnt be treated as seriously as the guys down the hall its possible that because conservatives have these traditional beliefs about gender roles in the family they might think that their female associates are more likely to quit and raise children so theyre less likely to invest in them carnahan said thats exactly what claire a pseudonym a yearold attorney at a midsized firm in manhattan run by a prominent republican donor sees in her office i feel like republican men slot women into two places they should be at home as wives taking care of the family or theyre sex objects she said noting that attractive young female associates are treated well at her firm in terms of being invited to client events and sitting in on meetings but she said thats not the same as treating them like employees with a future at the firm attractive women are viewed as people the male partners want around for social events and client events but they arent viewed as a longterm investment in terms of how do we train them how do we keep them here ive heard comments about women who get pregnant one woman took six months of leave and there were comments about how anyone who takes that kind of leave isnt serious for men not only are the investments in their careers different in conservative workplaces but so too are the expectations around work and family men dont have to contend with the stereotype that theyre either single and therefore sexually available or theyre mothers and therefore inadequate employees who should be at home with their children i used to work with a guy who would put up pictures of his daughter all over his door he was so proud of her claire said another man who made partner he was very open about i have to make it to all of my daughters school things and parentteacher conferences he would leave even if it was very inopportune for the team if a man does that hes viewed as being a really great dad and look at him finding that worklife balance whereas if a woman does it she is immediately viewed as not serious not dedicated to the job the imbalances arent so obvious many female lawyers say when they work for more liberal bosses whether theyre male or female in a previous job under a politically progressive male boss there was complete confidence in my work product alexis said they started from a position of assuming that i was right and my work product was good whereas now its almost reflexive to criticize or tell me im wrong in claires office liberal lawyers are a relative rarity and they stay quiet about their political views but she said it was striking to notice that the two male partners who have taken the greatest interest in my career and helping to train me and are not the partners who i necessarily did the most work for are both liberal examining biases promotion and retention of female lawyers are ongoing challenges in the legal field women have made up close to half of law students since the early s and about half of first and secondyear associates entrylevel lawyers at law firms are women still two decades after women achieved nearparity in law schools only of managing partners at the top american law firms are women women make up just of equity partners at law firms generally linda also a pseudonym recently left the midsized midwestern boutique firm she worked at for nearly a decade after a conservative evangelical christian man took over as managing partner when a tough as nails democratvoting woman retired the firm which was once one third women dropped to having just one female associate and one female partner linda herself the firm culture which before had been collaborative and civil shifted dramatically it became much more authoritarian much more topdown were gonna do it this way because i say so which also falls into that notion of dad being in charge linda said i never saw my career path take as much of a nosedive as when this conservative man took over for law firms one solution might be to encourage male partners and associates to check their own biases and stereotypes carnahan the author of the study said he hopes it will push men to think is there something im doing that im not conscious of do i have a subconscious bias in terms of my hiring decisions my training my promotion decisions he said that he hopes maybe seeing this kind of data could help people examine their own beliefs and how that might be impacting their subordinates but if a man already believes that women are better off at home with the kids its hard to imagine hell be persuaded to change by a survey indicating he may be the kind of boss who will stymie womens careers and for women there are no good solutions if your boss is treating you unfairly even going to hr about blatantly bad behavior said alexis can backfire once they get talked to by hr about a certain behavior or incident what a lot of the partners end up doing is just stop talking to that female associate she said so she gets less work and it ends up hurting her to succeed at her firm claire said women have to hide the parts of themselves that make them identifiably female such as being a mother the conservative view of women as either sex objects or mothers she said requires women if they want to make partner at a firm like this basically quoteunquote be one of the guys that means you dont know they have children and theyre always available what i asked claire would she need to personally do to thrive as a woman in her conservative workplace forgo having children work twice as hard as the guys its hard for me to answer that she said after a long pause because i just dont feel like i have a future here,2016-03,alexis yearold attorney midsized politically conservative law firm

as schools break up for the easter holidays parents are facing tougher challenges in finding childcare according to the charity children a record number of providers are closing their doors during the holidays leaving working parents in the lurch government figures show a growing crisis and children warns of a knockon effect on working parents and those mostly women seeking to rejoin the workforce research published this month by the department for education surveyed parents in england on their views and experiences of childcare it revealed that for of working parents the formal childcare providers ceased to operate during school holidays children has calculated that this figure has increased by since despite the governments attempts to increase childcare the report also found evidence of stalled progress in the number of parents with access to school holidayonly childcare of working parents with schoolage children one in five said they found arranging cover in the holidays difficult or very difficult no improvement on the numbers in two in five parents who did not use holiday childcare said they would be very likely to use it if it were available up from in suggesting significant unmet demand said children in last weeks budget the chancellor george osborne announced additional funding for some secondary schools to provide extracurricular activities that down the line might help some parents of older children during termtime the new funding will not be available for at least two years and the charity is warning that without urgent action efforts to encourage parents into work will be undermined earlier this year children released the results of a national inquiry britains families thriving or surviving a key finding was the difficulties parents faced in their struggle to balance work and family life with the resultant stress that kept parents awake at night the warnings about declining holiday places are backed by the latest available figures on the number of childcare providers figures released by the dfe in showed that since the number of registered holiday care providers in england had fallen by from to meaning a drop in registered childcare places from to meanwhile ukwide figures for the same period from the office of national statistics indicate a consistent increase in the number of families where all adults within a household work from in to in imelda redmond chief executive of children said further improvements in employment rates would be difficult to achieve without improving the childcare available the dfe survey found that more than half of nonworking mothers would prefer to go out to work if they could get quality childcare that was reliable and affordable weve heard the prime minister emphasise the importance of enabling parents to work with an improved childcare offer but very little has been done to address the problem of holiday childcare she said many parents dont have family nearby and rely on formal childcare like holiday clubs with a record high number of providers closing their doors during the holidays its not surprising that many parents find the holidays intensely stressful these figures indicate an unsustainable growing disparity between the availability and need at best this means parents trying to patch childcare together between annual leave ad hoc play schemes and asking favours

on good days we are able to talk about what is going on with the kids discuss world affairs and sometimes although increasingly rarely have a laugh more and more we are ships that pass in the night a simmering resentment ever present which we struggle to conceal for the sake of the kids it is truly painful for me and i can only imagine that it must be for you too although we dont discuss it on the few occasions when my frustration has boiled over and i have mentioned divorce you seem shocked that i could be selfish enough to entertain such an idea we have been together for years starting out as equals with our own careers until you decided to do your own thing for several years i supported you in your endeavours practically financially and emotionally contrary to the advice of most of those around us and despite near bankruptcy against the odds it worked out better than we could have imagined and your financial and professional success has been meteoric this change in fortune coincided with our move to the country where we now live the birth of our first child and my no longer working that was when the cracks began to appear during a complicated and lifethreatening pregnancy several miscarriages and the difficulties of adapting to a new country with small children in tow i felt largely unsupported and literally and metaphorically alone your work has always come first in times of distress i have been left feeling unloved and unworthy i know from our rows about this that you believe that i am not a supportive wife when i have tried to discuss these feelings with you we invariably end up trying to outdo one another with the youre more selfish than me line and end in stalemate since i stopped having sex with you two years ago your resentment and dismissiveness towards me have reached new levels even our youngest child comments that you ignore me when you get up in the morning their awareness is even more difficult to deal with than the dismissiveness itself i have let my health and appearance go much to your obvious annoyance i drink more than i should eat more than i should and have become glum and reclusive the only thing that keeps me going is trying to do the best for our kids i do what i can to try to ensure they have a normal childhood while all the while im dying inside i feel that i have no other option than to stay with you we were born and raised in different countries and are now living in a third country that our children call home so where do i go if i leave you ironically and in spite of your success we could not afford two homes here as we live in one of the worlds most expensive cities i feel rightly or wrongly that this is best for the kids and so do you it would seem we dont have blazing rows neither of us is violent and we coparent well enough so it doesnt feel as if i have a good enough reason to tear their lives apart other than my own inner torment and i admit your complete frustration with me what compelled me to write this letter was a cold yes a pathetic cold i have been sneezing and coughing all weekend while trying to ensure that the kids are fed and watered and the household runs smoothly not once have you asked if im ok or offered to do the kids bedtime routine or even suggested i might have a sunday liein instead of you god forbid it is a small thing but it sums up our marriage depressingly most of my former flatmates would probably have been more attentive than you my husband as i write i am peevishly hoping you catch my cold so that i can reciprocate in kind for tragically that is what

i am watching television when my daughter comes over for a cuddle nothing unusual in that perhaps except that she is has a fulltime job and is used to travelling round the world on her own most of the time her response to even an affectionate hair ruffle is to dart away so while this momentary closeness is a poignant reminder of her earlier years i feel a touch of anxiety as well is anything going on in her life that she needs help with any worries and what can or cant i ask the truthful answer is probably not that much negotiating your offsprings early s can be one of the trickiest periods in a parents life and is certainly the least charted while the market is saturated with books on babyhood early childhood and the teens there are remarkably few about the young adult phase particularly its deeper emotional aspects all of which is a pity as i have lost count of the conversations i have had with puzzled confused or disappointed parents of sons and daughters aged around to unsure of how to handle their own or their childrens emotions as the mother of a yearold told me plaintively my daughter and i used to talk about everything we were so close now we can just about get through a discussion on what to eat for supper a father of two young adults puts it well i am so careful to respect their space not to intrude that i fear i end up looking as if i simply dont care like most of my friends i left home straight after university it would have been plain weird to live with my parents after the age of or says one friend nowadays of course a large number of young adults still live at home most working hard to establish solid incomes and relationships and master the practical skills of living but inevitably radiating an air of despondency because of the difficulty of acquiring sufficient resources to set up independently but the despondency can work both ways says the mother of one yearold my daughter has recently moved back in with me after three years living and working in another city i thought we had done the separation thing successfully i have settled down to life on my own and am relishing it dont get me wrong we are really close but having her back in my home well im beside myself which of course makes me feel guilty living with adult children makes it even harder to stand back and let them fix their own emotional problems a friend whose son experiences occasional bouts of depression says when he was younger i would have made doctors appointments or suggested the right book to read and he would have accepted it recently i made some useful suggestions and he said im sorry this just isnt helping me he shut the conversation down it was a more adult dismissal not a teenage fit of pique and he was right of course it alerts me to the fact that i cant fix stuff and he doesnt want me to but it feels very hard partly because we are living under the same roof and i can see the mistakes he is making on a daily basis i have learned to draw on what i call the being alongside strategy first developed during the more explosive but handson teenage years lifts and walks visits to the shops cooking a meal together freed of the weight of expectation the talk will often flow more freely indeed it may positively tumble out wholly unedited slowly i have learned to listen more and talk less so that nowadays i largely stay silent bar encouraging murmurs or prompt questions offering little commentary or advice which is surprisingly hard unless asked which these days i almost never am more broadly i am convinced that taking a genuine interest in our young adults lives as they are not as we wish they should or could be is an essential part of navigating this tricky phase rather like the skills of a loving friendship which a surprisingly high number of adults never master either it is not easy to get right but all too clear when it goes wrong we have all met the parent who vocally disapproves of a childs partner because they are of the wrong sex class or ethnic background or the mother or father who has a fixed idea of what success looks like and is disdainful or judgmental of different paths or periods of experimental uncertainty almost all parents have struggled with similar feelings but the important thing is to learn to keep them contained on the other hand a little effort goes a long way as our children get older move away leave home for college or university we often dont know their friends or understand their social world or not in the way we did when they were little and under our care or control i believe it helps enormously not only to make these new friends and interests welcome but to display curiosity empathy and kindness in relation to our childrens developing and inevitably separate life choices i learned this years ago when a man i knew in my s told me that when his best friend at university killed himself he wanted his parents to go to the funeral even though they had only met the friend a couple of times they refused on the grounds that this loss was really nothing to do with them he never forgave them for what he saw not just as their callousness to the dead friends family but their refusal to accept what mattered so much to him that breach endured and coloured his relationship with them for decades i am also convinced that parents who have their own fulfilling lives are the best kind for young adults my mother and father were always busy and purposeful i never felt i had to visit them or that they needed me there to make their life complete whats more they were a lot of fun i would like my own children to feel the same about me and their father but whether things are going well or badly we remain and always should be the safe haven the last resort the taken for granted the ultimate backup i can still remember how reassuring it was to know during my thrilling terrifying tedious s that if this project or that relationship crashed and burned there was always a place for me a door i could knock on day or night a friendly face someone ready to put the kettle on share a meal take a friendly interest or yes offer that crucial hug of reassurance long after i had physically moved away i still needed an emotional home to which i could return even when it was probably the last place i wanted to be paradoxically the more i could depend on it the less i needed to until one day i realised in some deep instinctive way that i had truly left home lizzie brooke is a pseudonym,2016-03,watching television daughter come cuddle nothing unusual perhaps except ha fulltime job used

i joined the armed forces when i was years old i had moved to the uk after a difficult childhood in jamaica and i wanted to do something different to everyone else none of my friends were doing anything like active service so it seemed like a good option for me during my time in the army i served with the royal logistics corps and was based at colchester for three years and raf odiham for two i also spent time in afghanistan for the most part my time in the army was enjoyable i felt like i was part of a family and have happy memories of my time on tour with my comrades but i did see things that left me traumatised as a result i developed a very short temper and found that i didnt have patience for anything i left the forces because i was sick of the lifestyle and because my temper was becoming a problem there isnt any room in the army for that kind of attitude when i first got back home everything was fine i had a solid support network consisting of family friends and my girlfriend i felt that i had people to turn to if i needed them i didnt struggle to find work but it was never a solid stable income i soon began to experience mental health issues which i later found out were a result of my experiences in afghanistan without any treatment i turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism and started drinking heavily i still had a short temper and was having extreme mood swings that made me behave aggressively this all contributed to the breakdown of my relationship with my girlfriend who had just given birth to our daughter i moved out of her home and was sleeping on my uncles sofa i had to keep relying on the support of friends and family i couldnt sort anything stable out for myself shortly after my daughter was born i realised i needed to change my dad wasnt around when i was growing up and i didnt want my daughter to have the same experience i wanted to be there for her and provide for her so that she would have a solid father figure my daughter was the first reason i had to have stability in my life for a long time i wanted to get better for her i kept hold of my determination to change my life and made a conscious effort to reduce my drinking so that i could keep seeing my daughter even if i wasnt living with her but at the same time i was finding it extremely difficult to find a steady place to live i needed a safe place where my daughter could come to stay but the shortterm contracts i was working didnt provide enough money to rent privately at work one day i saw a banner promoting the services of a charity called stoll the advert said they provided housing support for vulnerable exservicemen and women running a number of programmes to help veterans find stable accommodation and supporting them as they rebuilt their lives i immediately got in touch with them and they came through for me a support worker got in touch and helped me to apply for accommodation through a number of supported social housing schemes i was also referred to the veterans assessment clinic so that i could seek treatment for my alcohol problems i was offered a onebedroom property through stolls veterans nomination scheme so that i could finally afford to rent a place for myself the staff were so helpful throughout the whole process and they worked with other charities to raise money to help furnish my flat the best part is that my new home is just five minutes away from my daughters nursery and i have her to stay with me a few days a week the help that i was given has allowed me the sense of security and stability that i was lacking after the army for the first time in a long time i feel safe now i can finish a day at work without worrying about where to stay that night i can finally say im going home,2016-03,joined armed force

the young family low income natalie shipp and her fiance adam long will pocket an extra a year when the personal allowance increases by to on april and take home a further taxfree when it increases to next year writes donna ferguson they plan to invest as much as they can of this money into the new lifetime isa for unders which came as a welcome surprise the extra money isnt much to many people but it is to us says natalie at the moment we dont have any savings or pensions and no spare money to save anyway its a massive benefit to think well get from the government for every we save taxfree that will definitely encourage us to save more the couple rent their home in wiltshire but would like to buy one day adam earns a year as a forklift driver for asda while natalie is a fulltime mum to their three young children ebony eight indie three and thea one rent takes up the majority of adams earnings and they rely on working and child tax credits to help pay for their groceries and bills natalie is glad there were no further cuts to these credits which will be frozen for the next four years but would have liked to see more help with childcare costs in the budget so she could afford to work instead of having to wait until her children were older the cost of childcare means that financially were better off with me not working which frustrates me i think the chancellor should have offered more support for people like me who want to work she volunteers for children a charity that runs her local childrens centre and was disappointed that no extra funding was offered for such facilities which means a third of the centres in her local area will have to close im also worried about these plans to make all schools academies will it mean that schools in better areas will have a lot more to offer than schools in lower class areas a sugar tax is a good idea but my kids dont drink sugary drinks anyway this government is not putting enough focus on young children at the start of their lives childrens centres play such an important role in helping to stimulate children and support parents she also wishes there had been more funding for the nhs one of my daughters is being assessed for autism and theres no funding for her assessment on the nhs so were having to rely on a charity to do it i would have liked to see the chancellor prioritising the nhs more than businesses the firsttime buyers alex jeffers and his girlfriend carol woodman are saving to buy their first home writes hilary osborne they have already taken advantage of george osbornes helptobuy isa opening a halifax account as soon as it launched in december ive been paying steadily into that for the last few months ive been fortunate and ive been able to put the full a month into the account says alex under the current rules when they are ready to buy their savings will be topped up by a government payment of up to each but if they save into a lifetime isa instead they could get even more alex says the prospect of a bigger government payment sounds attractive as does the fact that the bonus can be earned on longerterm savings it sounds a lot better than an account that you can only use to buy a house it gives a bit more flexibility and if i dont end up buying anywhere im not losing that he doesnt have a pension the small tech company he works for in cardiff wont have to automatically enrol him into a scheme until august and he says he has just not got round to opening one himself being able to continue paying into the same account could make it a lot simpler alex had already started saving before the account was launched but still expects it to be a couple of years before the couple can start looking for somewhere to buy they pay a month between them to rent a flat and expect to look at flats when they are ready to buy which means spending between and he estimates alex says that stamp duty changes that make it more expensive for people to buy second homes should help them the part of cardiff i used to live in is full of to let signs you walk down the street and theyre everywhere he says a lot of firsttime buyers have been at a disadvantage the retired headteacher there was precious little in the budget for older people says retired headteacher jane cowley one of several hundred thousand women born in the mids who argue they have been seriously shortchanged by increases to the state pension age writes rupert jones george osbornes first comment was that the uk was set to grow faster than any other major advanced economy in the world but cowley says that despite this there seems to be no money to support more vulnerable people in society such as pensioners and the disabled for decades cowley had been expecting to receive her state pension at but measures included in the pensions act increased her state pension age spa to years and two months in the coalition government pushed through a speedingup of the timetable and as a result her spa was raised again to years and eight months cowley was born in which means she is in the worstaffected age group the biggest losers from this shakeup are said to be the estimated women born between october and april she is a retired primary school head who worked in surrey and now lives in northumberland with her husband clive she has three sons aged and and backs the campaign being run by women against state pension inequality waspi which has been calling for fair transitional arrangements to help those adversely affected by the spa changes cowley says she is very disappointed osborne did not take the opportunity to put right that obvious wrong ros altmann the pensions minister said some time ago that women feel they simply dont matter to policymakers and certainly that came through strongly in this budget she acknowledges that the lifetime isa for unders which young people can use to buy their first home or save for their retirement with a cash bonus from the government is something that will benefit people such as her sons im sure that for younger people that is going to be a huge help the choice is often stark between saving for a pension and saving for a house in the meantime she will continue to back the waspi calls for a better deal for the s women cowley says her two spa increases represent a financial loss of around as they mean her having to wait almost six extra years to get her state pension cash both governments have been at fault she says ive got a small occupational pension that i can draw on at the moment but there are a lot of women who havent got one theres someone ive met who had no idea she wasnt going to get her pension at she decided to give up work because her father was poorly she had to sell her house and is now living off her savings while she cares for her father the pensioner retired english teacher paul russell from shipley in west yorkshire had his personal checklist of reforms ready as he sat down to watch the chancellors speech writes patrick collinson an hour later he had been able to tick off none of them and has been left fearful that with continued austerity vital local care services used by the elderly will remain under severe threat social care for the elderly provided by local authorities is the elephant in the room it is being constantly downgraded and underfunded a lot of local daycare centres are going to close over the next few years he tops up his state pension with a reasonable public sector pension but says it is far from lavish after social care his big concern is the new single tier state pension that is expected to be a week compared with the current state pension of when it comes into force in april but to get that money youll need a full years of ni contributions and an awful lot of people mainly women wont be in that situation everybodys going to be individually assessed russell acknowledges that while the triple lock system which was safe again in this budget has ensured that state pensioners have gained annual increases they have not been as attractive as some people think i am keen to keep the triple lock but am not happy the way it is tied to the cpi rather than the rpi and remember the triple lock only applies to the basic state pension not the earningsrelated element that means that onethird of my state pension has not been increasing id like to see a basic state pension that really is a living pension the idea of surviving on a week is risible a yorkshire man paul is less than impressed by osbornes constant references to the northern powerhouse its mostly waffle he says yes hes gave the goahead to hs between leeds and manchester but its only miles we dont need high speed we just need a normal speed line with more carriages rather than the slow and outdated service we have now paul and his wife tina have seven children and grandchildren my experience is that the young are having a rotten time but its not because people like me are doing particularly well paul says the debate has gone too far in saying that its all the fault of older people we have also had the pressure of austerity paul retired from teaching more than a decade ago but worries that the generation behind him are going to have to work longer for less society will just have to accept that more of its resources are going to have to go towards older people he says the government is going to have to wake up to the fact that it has to adjust the balance of its budget to reflect the population profile of the country there are going to be more and more older people the businesswoman macaroon maker rosie ginday is thrilled about the boost to the business rates relief announced in the budget but bemused about the cut to corporation tax writes katie allen she set up the social enterprise miss macaroon five years ago and ploughs the profits back into training young people who are exoffenders care leavers and have been longterm unemployed the birminghambased pastry chef is about to branch out into new retail outlets in stations airports and shopping centres so the prospect of paying less or no business rates is welcome it will definitely help us and give us a bit more of a security blanket says ginday who is it might only make a difference of a couple of thousand pounds but that could help put two more people on our training course and to potentially come off benefits and find employment the business is growing quickly and turnover this year will be from a kitchen on the outskirts of the city a team of four pastry chefs pipe bake and fill macaroons a day bespoke versions are sold to corporate clients such as fashion house karl lagerfeld to use as gifts and the company also caters for weddings and sells macaroons wholesale to restaurants retailers and hotels ginday hopes the move into retail could create up to jobs so far people have been through her fourweek course in macaroon making personal development and other skills to help them get into work some have gone on to work with her others she has helped find jobs and apprenticeships elsewhere ginday wishes osborne had provided more help for social enterprises like hers rather than cutting corporation tax again miss macaroon paid in corporation tax last year the same amount as paid by facebook in the uk in its latest full year businesses shouldnt be getting tax breaks when the welfare state is being attacked to the extent it is she says i think corporation tax is not that much for us it makes a big difference that money could put people through our training course we are paying on our profits and huge corporations dont seem to pay their fair share there should be some kind of link to how much good work you are doing the millennial evie calder cannot imagine how she will take the first steps towards owning a home and there was nothing in the budget to help her do that writes rebecca smithers its just not something i can get my head round says the yearold ucl postgraduate who lives and works in london as a paid intern for a climate change ngo i live hand to mouth and have no savings every single penny i earn goes on rent food travel and trying to pay off my overdraft im lucky if i get to the end of the month without ending up overdrawn again ineligible for benefits she has survived financially so far by sharing a flat with her boyfriend and two of his friends an arrangement that will end soon when he goes abroad to work and with occasional financial handouts from her parents now she is hoping that the internship which follows a previous unpaid one will lead to a job and the security that will bring i didnt think that at my age things would be this difficult says evie my sisters are four and six years older than me but they have managed to buy homes are both married and close to starting families they have not suffered in the way that i have i cannot even begin to think about my student debt i have just had to park it in a box since september evie has been working as a paid intern for which she receives an hour less than the london living wage of but her earnings have not amounted to a proper salary and she had not expected the internship to last for more than six months which would have kept her earnings below the current personal tax allowance of she is disappointed that a budget pitched shamelessly at the squeezed next generation only aims to help those who are struggling to save enough for a house but fails to address those who are struggling to save anything at all especially in london more could have been done to help young people of my age trying to work and survive in the capital which is in a bubble of its own even the london living wage is not enough to survive on let alone to save and im disappointed that this wasnt addressed in the budget at all with her climate change hat on she is not impressed that the oil and gas industry will benefit from bn of tax cuts as the supplementary charge is cut from to even a move to another flat share in mile end for which she will pay an allin mates rate of a month will be a struggle she fears i try to stay optimistic but sometimes i get depressed about what is happening to my generation i enjoy the work and this is what i want to do i have not sold out in the way that some people have although this would have made things much easier financially i know im not going to be earning a lot of money but i deserve to be able to plan for the future and to be able to start thinking about getting a foot on the property ladder,2016-03,young family low income natalie shipp fiance

campaigners against domestic violence blocked the entrance to the treasury with a fence in a protest over cuts to services for vulnerable people before this weeks budget calling such austerity measures a sexist racist choice domestic violence services across the uk have lost more than of their funding since according to sisters uncut the feminist direct action group behind the protest in westminster on monday morning the group which was formed in and has a number of regional branches said the ability of domestic violence survivors to flee abuse now depended on their postcode kat vail a member of sisters uncut said we have a very basic demand the government must ringfence funding for domestic violence services this is the only way to make sure they can stay running domestic violence is high in the uk one in three women will experience it yet services that support survivors are being forced to close because the government wont put a secure funding plan in place campaigners from across the uk many of them survivors of domestic abuse gathered and used a wooden fence to barricade the entrance to the treasury at horse guards road symbolising their plea to the chancellor george osborne protesters wearing tshirts and badges bearing the sisters uncut logo chanted slogans such as hey mister get your hands off our sister as employees entered the building after the treasurys front door was shut the group dispersed the group said sisters uncut maintain that austerity is a sexist racist choice domestic violence support services are a vital lifeline for women fleeing domestic violence they need secure funding in order to continue their lifesaving work specialist domestic violence services are funded by local councils whose budgets have been halved by osborne the group added vital services and the women they support face a precarious future and already areas of the country are returning to a time before refuges existed although some services remained open such as the specialist lgbt service broken rainbow there was no guarantee that they would be running in a year campaigners said some groups would be harder hit between and specialist domestic violence services supporting women from minority groups decreased by the group said imkaan a feminist group which supports a membership of refuges and other services for black and minority ethnic groups has seen members struggling to stay open amid significant statutory funding cuts a recent report from imkaan detailed what they claim is a funding crisis affecting such services sisters uncut said the chancellor had announced shortterm gestures towards domestic violence services in his budgets in the july budget osborne pledged m for domestic violence refuges in november he announced a m tampon tax fund that domestic violence services could apply to over the next four years the group described this measure as a sticking plaster and said the only adequate model to guarantee womens safety was longterm ringfenced funding for domestic violence services,2016-03,campaigner domestic violence blocked entrance treasury fence protest cut service vulnerable people week budget calling

when youre a parent to a young child you spend a lot of time talking about feelings about having to share about being disappointed because no you may not have a cookie instead of broccoli about the grave injustice of a parent pressing the elevator button before the child has a chance to and in a parenting culture thats increasingly concerned with centering childrens needs above all else mothers and fathers have become adept at talking about their kids feelings while jumping through hoops to mask their own i will never forget the day i saw a threeyearold spit in their mothers face only to hear her say afterwards its ok to have a difficult day but new research suggests that parents who hide their negative emotions are doing their children and themselves a disservice a study published in this months personality and social psychology journal from researchers at the university of toronto says that when parents put on a fauxhappy face for their kids they do damage to their own sense of wellbeing and authenticity the front can even impede a high quality parentchild bond the study says for the average parent the findings suggest when they attempt to hide their negative emotion expression and overexpress their positive emotions with their children it actually comes at a cost doing so may lead parents to feel worse themselves researcher dr emily impett says it makes sense that parents often fall back on amping up the positivity for the sake of their children there are a lot of things in the world we want to protect our kids from but children are often smarter than we give them credit for and are quite in tune with what the people closest to them their parents are feeling there was a time about a year or so ago for example when i received some bad news over the phone i was home with my fouryearold and so i did my best to put on a brave face she knew immediately something was wrong though and was confused when i finally let a few tears out and explained that mom heard something sad about a friend she was of course just fine my daughter patted my shoulder gave me a hug and went back to playing she felt better that she was able to help me and the moment made a lot more sense to her emotionally than a maniacally smiling mom holding back sobs i was glad that i could feel sad momentarily and not have to work hard to hide that the emotional energy of relaying positive feelings to your children when you dont feel them is a move the researchers called high cost that it may seem like the most beneficial to your child at the time but that parents should find other ways of communicating emotions that allow them to feel true to themselves but this is also about children seeing the world in a more honest way of course we will want to shield our children from things that arent ageappropriate or harmful but parents having a range of emotions even sad or angry ones dont fall into that category its better to raise a generation of kids who understand that moms and dads are people too and that wed probably be happier with that cookie over broccoli as well,2016-03,youre parent young child spend lot time talking feeling share disappointed may cookie instead broccoli grave injustice parent pressing elevator button child ha chance parenting culture thats increasingly concerned centering childrens need else mother father become adept

threequarters of employers have done nothing to analyse whether they are paying women as much as men ahead of new rules that will force them to publish data on their gender pay gap a survey of employers found that larger firms are most likely to have begun work on analysing whether they are paying women fairly but the research by the chartered institute of personnel and development found that only one in four firms had performed any analysis at all the cipd said this showed that companies were still uncertain about how to comply with the rules from april next year companies with more than o employees will be required to identify how much male and female staff are paid with league tables of the pay gap due to be published a year later they will have to reveal the information on their website and report the figures annually with senior executives signing off on the numbers the legislation introduced by women and equalities minister nicky morgan is designed to address studies showing that women are still underpaid four decades after the equal pay act of recent studies suggest that women earn an average of less than men over their working life but the cipd said its study showed that league tables could prove counterproductive dianah worman diversity adviser for the cipd said were not convinced that the proposals to publish pay gap league tables across economic sectors will be helpful in levering systemic change she warned that league tables could create a selffulfilling prophecy if women shy away from industries where the data shows they already underrepresented one of the problems is that people have to see the advantages of doing it if you put a threat behind it that will expose weaknesses people might draw their horns in and not come clean if we want to encourage positive change you need people to be authentic and honest if being honest could expose you to a league table that puts people off from working in that sector it has the opposite effect to whats intended the notion of league tables has also met with criticism from business lobby group the confederation of british industry director general carolyn fairbairn said that to name and shame firms was unfair because it failed to take into account factors that might skew figures such as difference between the sort of staff who work in different sectors kamaljeet jandu equality officer of

late last year i went to a conference session on sexism in the workplace about of us mostly young professional women swapped demoralising anecdotes about how the pay gap motherhood sexual harassment and oppressive gender expectations had impacted our careers we were all on pretty much the same page there was furious agreement that women are subjected to sexism in the public sphere and that this is harmful to individuals and to society as a whole fantastic i thought were switched on we know whats what and were here together to talk about what we can do to fix things but as the focus shifted from describing the problem to proposing solutions it was like watching a train derail in slow motion what about mentoring somebody said what if we teach women to negotiate for higher pay what if companies are encouraged to set targets for women in executive roles what if we build a culture of open negotiation in our own workplaces where women are empowered to ask for more flexible hours i shifted in my seat waiting for someone to bring up public daycare or governmentfunded parental leave or the proliferation of underpaid pinkcollar jobs or the economic devaluation of womens reproductive labour or any of the issues that have historically been sites of feminist struggle nobody did so i raised my hand to mention my sister who is a parttime childcare worker how would training women to ask for higher pay help her as someone who earns a set award wage and has very little power to negotiate anything how would professional mentoring empower her how would her life be improved by quotas for women on boards a mildly uncomfortable pause followed i ploughed on motivated half by an immediate anxiety about filling the conversational gap and half by raw indignation shouldnt our demands be for universal changes to the structure of society that will help all women i asked there was a subdued murmur of assent and a couple of women voiced agreement but the matter was soon forgotten and i spent the rest of the session in a state of tense disappointment liberal feminism is broadly characterised by its naturalisation of enlightenment values individual choice meritocracy autonomy progress the emancipatory power of technology and an acceptance of the basic structures of capitalist social organisation this manifests as a selfhelp philosophy typified by facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandbergs book lean in which attributes womens difficulty achieving career advancement to their docile peoplepleasing socialisation sandbergs utopia is one in which women inspire themselves out of the effects of sexism by becoming more assertive in the corporate sphere on this account womens belief in their own competence takes on a quasimagical power and their individual striving in the current order is the key to ending oppression this mythology is only available to women who share most of sandbergs own social positions middle or upperclass white educated heterosexual able employed it doesnt really attempt to engage in analysis of material or structural factors that circumscribe womens freedom the concepts it excludes from its analysis solidarity collective action bottomup democracy are the ones most essential to the project of emancipating women as a class liberal feminisms theoretical poverty and ignorance of structural factors explain the gap between its omnipresence in public discourse and seeming lack of ability to achieve material gains for women even at the height of this new feminisms cultural ascendancy its victories have been few and far between in december prominent american womens website jezebel published an essay by one of its editors jia tolentino titled no offense she writes the offense model has failed and dramatically women have a prominent voice in online media feminism is a broad and verbally defended platform and what has it all amounted to except a nightmarish discursive juxtaposition between what feminism says and what it is able to do pop stars preach female solidarity while reproductive rights roll back all over the country we have politicized and vindicated every possible manifestation of female narcissism without getting any legislative movement towards mandatory paid parental leave feminism is proliferating essentially as merchandise we can buy anything that suits us and nothing that we really need the avowal of something does not instantiate it is that as obvious as i think fervent support for a political position does not automatically translate into any meaningful gains the failure of the feminist offense factory to result in much else other than better tv and extremely woke yearolds should be sufficient proof of that tolentino and i are both in our mids and the sense of fatigue that permeates her essay is familiar to me the edifice of popular feminism is a carnival of hot takes and gifs and twitter wars and celebrities and language policing so much language policing its entertaining and enraging but leaves very little trace of itself the next day like a dropped icecream washed away by the rain at the pay gap panel session i mentioned earlier the women present seemed unperturbed by the idea that swapping corporate career tips was feminism when i brought up collective possibilities it was an act of rudeness i was literally changing the subject moving the conversation away from its agreedon parameters for apparently unclear reasons yet almost all of them had earlier offered a story of workplace sexism from their own experience and some even spoke of being subjected to neardaily harassment clearly their occupation of positions in the upper socioeconomic echelons of society had not protected them against manifestations of structural sexism yet this was still the accepted approach as it is in modern feminism what to do then how to fill the gap created by the irrelevance of secondwave organising principles the neoliberal destruction of institutions such as unions mass political parties churches community groups movements that might once have been sources of collective practice we cant eliminate all conflict and the rejection of naive liberalism will not resolve itself automatically into a political movement but we do have some things going for us contrary to what a lot of older commentators believe young women care just as much about change as every other generation given that we have skin in the game especially in terms of our diminishing access to the goods of life housing stable employment a nonfucked climate avenues for exercising civic power and so on were in a prime position to organise in the us democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has tapped into this vein of enthusiasm to produce a burgeoning movement based heavily on volunteer organising among youth populations it remains to be seen how successful this effort will be but it does prove that such action is indeed possible the black lives matter movement continues to operate protesting against the extrajudicial killing and mass incarceration of americas black population blacklivesmatter has already been courted extensively by sanders and his rival hillary clinton it has put racial justice squarely back on the public agenda and drawn a mass of attention to the ongoing harm caused by us racism closer to my home an increasing awareness of australias harrowing domestic violence epidemic has led to the formation of new coalitions based on the rejection of male domination in the private sphere what these initiatives have in

domestic violence leave remains a sticking point in a longrunning industrial dispute between the union representing public servants and the federal government the community and public sector union wants allocated leave for survivors of domestic violence and their families so they can rebuild their lives by attending counselling and court hearings and take time out of work to move house only four commonwealth agencies have specific allowances for domestic violence leave where specific leave exists the bargaining policy does not require its removal the public service commissioner john lloyd said it is not necessary for other agencies to create a new leave type given the availability of existing leave domestic violence leave is covered in many agreements under miscellaneous leave but the cpsu says not having it defined in legislation leaves it to the discretion of employers there are a raft of womenfocused and womenfriendly rights and conditions being stripped out of agreements the unions national secretary nadine flood said family violence leave is just another target its extraordinary employees at the department of families housing community services and indigenous affairs had domestic violence leave but when employees were wrapped into the department of social services it was lost the union said a draft agreement presented to the national disability insurance agency also removed explicit references to domestic violence leave flood said the employment minister michaelia cash who also holds the womens portfolio strongly denied that public service departments were being told to remove domestic violence leave provisions this is simply false she said the public service commission has issued no such order or any other instruction of this kind no public service agency has proposed any new agreement or arrangement that would remove the ability for workers to access leave following an incident of domestic violence public servants will retain the ability to take leave where this is necessary in relation to an instance of domestic violence this includes both entitlements under existing enterprise agreements that allow for leave to be taken plus any entitlements under separate policies that apply to particular departments or agencies flood said no new entitlements were being considered in this round of bargaining because new conditions would be considered enhancements of existing agreements labors spokeswoman on trade penny wong told sky news it was disappointing that domestic violence leave would not be considered in new agreements people cant put that on the table as a new condition they want she said leave for people who are the victims of family and domestic violence should be a general standard and we should start with it in the public sector negotiations with cash have entirely broken down after a protracted bargaining process lasting more than two years flood said we have no one and nowhere to resolve this issue at the moment she said queensland public servants were granted domestic violence leave in november and a number of large companies including telstra have also offered it to its employees a senate committee in august recommended that domestic violence leave be offered to all employees commonwealth workers have effectively engaged in a monthslong pay freeze as negotiation for a new agreement stalled shortly after the coalition took office in september unions have rejected the governments offer of a pay rise over three years in exchange for the reduction of entitlements a number of departments including border force have engaged in industrial action to expedite the bargaining process anyone affected by sexual assault or domestic violence can call respect or or visit

i know what youre thinking men international womens day feels like a fun day on which to say it out loud admit the suspicion thats been building up since you first cracked the spine of a history book before realising that books are for people who cant get by on gut instinct and charm lets say it together while the ladies are busy reading something in the lifestyle section is there really anything that women are better at than us new polling has revealed that men are more worried about sexism than women of adult men agree that most men are sexist while only of women agree men are better at acknowledging sexism exists than women thats how good we are were not just better at being sexist were also better at being concerned about sexism take a moment to enjoy that fact its the sort of thing you can impress a woman in a bar with later before explaining your views on international womens day to her remember to speak loudly and slowly obviously if men are any better at acknowledging sexism its because its easier for us it doesnt cost us anything to accept that plenty of men treat women unfairly by acknowledging sexism we can excuse ourselves acknowledging the existence of sexism as an abstract thought is like switching off your lights for earth hour before you head off for your holiday in bogot as you sip a bloody mary in the skies over caracas you can tell yourself that an hour of home lightbulb wattage has been saved and along with it the fate of the earth below the illusion of enlightened progress is one that we constantly sell to ourselves its easier to be a man its easier in almost every conceivable way from the simplest of human interaction to the most significant women are patronised controlled belittled and dismissed the equivalent term employed by people who would call a woman love dear or darling when addressing a man is sir a man will not be cautioned that the drink theyve selected on a menu is strong or that their choice of curry is hot when i wake up in the morning i am waking to a world that says i can be a titan of industry politics or culture such is the perilous state of men that allegedly salman rushdie has to be consoled every year that he doesnt win the nobel prize for literature i am starting to worry that im going to have to step it up a gear or two to be in with a shot myself ask almost any young boy and the ceiling of male ambition is quite literally intergalactic conquest most women would be grateful to get through a day without an unwelcome sexual advance sexual harassment is a fixture in modern life its there alongside low expectations pay inequality and the structural inequalities upon which our society still exists the political sphere is dominated by the male sex we are raised to believe that we can achieve anything and the walls of galleries and museums are covered in examples of great men who have done so before us of course we can accept sexism from the position of comfort and entitlement in which we find ourselves the challenge is doing something about it men may be more willing to admit to a sexist society but we do not seem more willing to address it a friendly critic suggested to me that jokes about international womens day are in bad taste that men should shut up and get out of the way of womens voices i dont agree that men should be voiceless on a day to acknowledge the ongoing fight for equality but i realise that we should absolutely stop the snide jokes about it we dont mock remembrance sunday a day dedicated in some part to remembering the epic magnitude with which brave men have been prepared to kill each other and die in awfully large numbers rightly we observe the solemn sacrifice of the fallen and build national monuments international womens day is a day to observe that women have been marginalised objectified beaten raped and murdered by men this isnt just a sad historical fact although history is brimming with inexcusable levels of inequality its also a tragic modern reality on a scale that is incomprehensible we have no way to appreciate or understand just how pervasive the problem is how ingrained the injustices are women didnt just give their lives in two world wars they werent just killed by the famous evil dictators of history but by domestic dictatorships in homes around the world we owe it to their memory to the injustice they faced and to the challenge of the fight still ahead of us to honour this struggle with the same respect of course its easier for men to acknowledge sexism we are the perpetrators not the victims accepting a problem exists is simple showing respect to the women around us is the real challenge,2016-03,know youre thinking men international womens day feel like fun day say loud admit suspicion thats building since

women who become mothers before earn less than their peers who have not had children the trades union congress is to say as it calls for better childcare support to tackle the motherhood pay penalty the tucs analysis to mark international womens day on tuesday says the disparity is down to younger mothers being more likely to have had a significant period out of work or working parttime before returning to fulltime work when their children are older in contrast to those who have children early in their careers women who have their first child at or older enjoy a wage bonus of compared with similar women who have not had children according to the research carried out for the tuc by the institute for public policy research the tuc says many older mothers are higher earners and more senior in their workplaces so are more able to afford fulltime childcare the researchers said that this cohort of women who had become mothers after and were in fulltime work at were more likely to be those women who had maintained continuity of employment through the transition to motherhood and they are more likely to be those for whom it made financial sense to return to fulltime work when their children were under five for example because their earnings significantly outstrip the costs of formal childcare the researchers added the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said the findings backed up union campaigns for better support for working parents this research shows that millions of mothers still suffer the motherhood pay penalty she said we need to do far more to support all working mums starting by increasing the number of quality parttime jobs and making childcare much more affordable women in fulltime wellpaid jobs shouldnt be the only ones able to both become parents and see their careers progress using the birth cohort study the ippr analysis compared mothers fulltime earnings with those of fulltime women with similar levels of education and in similar jobs but without children the research will form part of a wider tuc report on working parents to be published later this year to address the pay gap for mothers the tuc wants more free childcare from the end of maternity leave and support for more equal parenting roles the introduction of shared parental leave was a step towards this but because of the poor pay and restrictive eligibility requirements for fathers it is likely to have limited impact we need some better paid fathers only rather than shared leave the study said the tuc is also advocating more betterpaid jobs to be available on reduced hours or as flexible working to prevent women getting stuck in lowpaid parttime work after having children the fawcett society has also highlighted a motherhood penalty the womens rights charity said its research revealed that mothers were viewed as less committed while fathers were regarded as more committed it polled people and found that when a woman has a baby of people believe she becomes less committed to her job compared with just believing a man becomes less committed in contrast of people believe men become more committed after having children compared with just for women the divide in perceptions was driving inequality and forcing women and men into traditional male breadwinner female carer roles said fawcett societys chief executive sam smethers she called for more flexible work options to help parents saying we need a new option flexibility first we need to start from a different place and assume that all jobs are flexible working jobs unless there is a good business case for them not to be a separate report from the international labour organisation has highlighted that inequality between women and men persists throughout the global labour market analysing data from countries to mark international womens day the un agency concluded that significant progress made by women in education over the last two decades had not translated into comparable improvements in their position at work globally women still earn on average of what men earn according to the report women at work trends the report shows the enormous challenges women continue to face in finding and keeping decent jobs said the ilo director general guy ryder a uk government spokesperson said weve gone further than ever before in tackling the gender pay gap and the gap has been virtually eliminated for women under working full time however we know there is more to do to which is why we are requiring companies with more than workers to publish their gender pay gap and why we are extending this to the public sector as well we are also introducing a range of measures to help both mothers and fathers balance having a family with their career such as our plans to offer hours of free childcare for working parents the extension of shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working,2016-03,woman become mother earn less peer child trade union congress say call

i write today as a survivor of rape i write as someone who has lived through the trauma of sexual violence in the hope of highlighting the need to stand up for the respect and the rights of asylum seeker and refugee women being held in detention in australia and offshore on nauru as detailed in many reports many women in detention both on and offshore have allegedly been raped and sexually abused so today on international womens day i want to bring attention to prime minister malcolm turnbulls words we as leaders as a government must make it and we will make it a clear national objective of ours to ensure that australia is more respecting of women women must be respected disrespecting women is unacceptable it is unacceptable at every level does this call for respect extend to women who are held in australian run or funded detention facilities and offshore processing centres does it extend to women who have been found to be refugees but who we refuse to resettle in australia disrespecting women does not always result in violence against women but all violence against women begins with disrespecting women rape is one of the most extreme forms of disrespect and violence against women at what point is it acceptable to walk away from that respect at what point is it okay to turn our backs on those who have suffered at the hands of disrespect and violence while in our care or due to our refusal to provide protection we simply cannot turn our backs on women who are seeking safety in australia many of whom are fleeing from the very violence and persecution our prime minister condemns in i was raped by a stranger i am not writing to tell you about the rape itself but rather the impact it had on me for years following the assault i struggled with deep depression and anxiety i suffered flashbacks nightmares and panic attacks even today six years later as far as ive come there are still times when i am affected by it the last few months i have once again been experiencing flashbacks nightmares and anxiety in truth i have come to realise that reading hearing and thinking about the sexual violence that is being perpetrated against women in detention and offshore centres is a large part of what has triggered my own trauma yet i refuse to stop reading hearing and thinking about it because while it continues i cannot possibly ignore it while i know every persons experience is different and i dont know exactly how these women must be feeling right now because of my past i can begin to imagine and understand some of the pain trauma and suffering they are experiencing what i cannot begin to comprehend is how they are surviving their current situations given the immense trauma they have experienced i cannot comprehend how they are surviving in such isolation and uncertainty i am an australian citizen i live in safety and security i have access to medical care and counselling i have a network of endlessly supportive family and friends in spite of all this the trauma of the rape almost broke me for a long time i believed that the mental and emotional impact of it had permanently damaged me that i would never be the same again and perhaps i wont be every time i hear about another woman being raped or sexually assaulted in detention centres in australia or on nauru i cant help but feel their pain i feel their pain and i take it personally because these women have fled persecution and sought safety in australia and yet in our care or lack thereof they have been subject to such heinous crimes it took me years to be able to speak openly about what happened to me but knowing what i know about the horror of what it is to live through and survive rape i cant remain silent this friday march will mark the six year anniversary of my rape however instead of letting this date loom over me as the anniversary of something that almost ruined my life i am reclaiming it as the day that did not break me did not ruin my life because i survived i survived and while recovery is a long and winding road i know that i can and will make it i am already making it this friday i will be celebrating my survival with my family and friends and celebrating all that makes us women so strong resilient and powerful today of all days it weighs heavily on my heart that we are denying women in detention the same opportunity we are denying them the opportunity to heal to receive adequate medical care and support to live in safety and security i have great hope and faith that given the chance these women will recover i have no doubt that they are strong and resilient for they have already withstood so much too much we need to open the road to recovery for asylum seeker and refugee women all survivors of rape need immediate and ongoing medical treatment quality care and support they need an opportunity to heal and to begin to rebuild their lives i want malcolm turnbulls actions to speak as loud as his words we must become known as a country that is known for its respect for women asylum seekers and refugees women included if you need help call respect,2016-03,write today survivor rape write someone ha lived

david cameron will fail to deliver on a pledge to close the gender pay gap within a generation according to a senior conservative mp who used to be the cabinet minister for women and equalities maria miller chair of a parliamentary select committee that scrutinises gender equality told the guardian the government thinks the issue has been resolved and it has for women working fulltime under the age of but not for thousands of others the gender pay gap is particularly acute for women over and that is because of the lack of quality parttime working and lack of effective shared parentalleave policies the evidence is clear the government needs to take a long hard look at their policies miller highlighted that although the government has introduced parental leave statistics showed that at most of men will take up the option of extended time off with their newborns speaking before international womens day she added without the support of men women wont see the gap eliminated she said there was an urgent need for more jobs that were flexible and for a bigger push to ensure men share the burden of childcare it came as a survey of more than people by the fawcett society found that think women become less committed to their job after becoming mothers that compared with just who thought the same of men while of respondents said fathers became more committed to work the poll by survation found that threequarters of men take leave of two weeks or less after the birth of a child with a third taking just one to five days it found that women still do the lions share when it comes to childcare the womens rights group said the figures revealed that women suffered a motherhood penalty while fathers were granted a daddy bonus sam smethers the chief executive of the fawcett society said we need a decent dedicated period of leave for dads paid closer to replacement income rate so that they can afford to take it a government spokesman said the gender pay gap has been falling almost continuously is at the lowest on record and has been virtually eliminated for women under working fulltime thanks to the reforms this government is introducing we expect that trend to continue only last month we unveiled a raft of measures requiring companies with more than employees to publish their gender pay gap and we are extending that duty across the public sector we must all be ambitious and take action to close the gap once and for all the survey results come amid calls for a change in parliament to allow job sharing among mps the campaign is being spearheaded by the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell who said job sharing for mps is an idea whose time has come it will help open up the opportunity for disabled people to serve as mps and make the commons more representative of the community we are supposed to represent womens rights are at the centre of the debate over womens future in the european union with polls suggesting that most undecided voters are female labour mp emma reynolds said the campaign so far has been dominated by men it is clear that women are more receptive to other women making the arguments women need to be more visible in this campaign the aggressive tone of the debate risks switching off women voters arguments about abstract notions of sovereignty dont strike a chord with many women we need to make granular arguments about how the eu affects womens lives and their families reynolds and other female voices supporting the in campaign such as green party mp caroline lucas argue that the eu secures guarantees for women around parttime work and maternity leave but the out campaigners will be pushing for womens support as well on tuesday as they set up a new group called women for britain the conservative minister priti patel will give a speech comparing her fight to that of emmeline pankhurst as a suffragette pankhurst fought for the rights of women to have a vote a voice and a say in how their society is

women are likely to earn less than men over their working lives according to a new analysis that has sparked fresh calls for more shared parental leave to close the uks stubborn gender pay gap before international womens day on tuesday figures show a gap of or in average fulltime annual salaries between women and men more than four decades after the equal pay act of was introduced over a career of years that gap translates into a lifetime earnings shortfall of for female employees according to the analysis by the recruitment company robert half the fawcett society a womens rights organisation said the analysis was the latest evidence of a financial price paid by many women after having children the gender pay gap becomes a significant lifetime pay penalty the gap widens for older women and becomes a significant pensions gap in retirement said the fawcett societys chief executive sam smethers the impact of having children means that as mens careers take off womens often stagnate or decline she said their salaries never fully recover we have to make it easier for men to share care create flexibility first at work and open up more senior roles as quality parttime jobs the analysis by robert half also highlighted faster growth for mens fulltime salaries of compared with for women in the year to april based on earnings figures from the office for national statistics ons that took the median gross pay for fulltime male employees to compared with for women the average for men and women combined was katy tanner a director at robert half uk said there were important lessons for employers as they increasingly report skills shortages as indemand candidates continue to be in the drivers seat employers are needing to offer competitive remuneration and benefits packages above industry averages she said international womens day provides a platform to highlight the importance for rewarding all employees fairly on the basis of their contribution to the organisation rather than their gender or indeed any other point of difference while this new analysis puts the gender pay gap at the ons estimates the shortfall is the two measures differ because the ons compares median hourly earnings rather than annual earnings and excludes overtime it does this because overtime can skew results given that men work relatively more overtime than women using hourly earnings better accounts for the fact that men work on average more hours than women in the onss view the pay gap of in april the latest figure available marked a drop from in and was the lowest since records began in but the ons noted the gap has changed relatively little in recent years commenting on the potential lifetime gap highlighted in mondays analysis the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said far more must be done to tackle the uks gender pay gap we need more quality parttime jobs betterpaid fathers leave and more free childcare from the end of maternity leave to help mothers get back to work after having children a government spokesman said this government has gone further than ever before in tackling the gender pay gap only last month we unveiled a raft of measures requiring companies with more than employees to publish their gender pay gap and we are extending that duty across the public sector we are making progress with business towards the elimination of the gender pay gap there will always be more to do but we expect that progress to continue as we continue towards a truly equal workforce in all sectors david cameron has vowed to end the gender pay gap in a generation and last year set out new rules forcing every company that employs more than people to publish the pay differences the uk has also introduced shared parental leave but equality campaigners are concerned too few families can afford for fathers to take it the uk has made headway in some respects on gender equality at work according to separate research published on monday that shows the country rising up a women in work league table britain climbed to th place from st the year before in a ranking of countries by the consultants pwc iceland norway and sweden held their top three places in the table which is based on data from the authors put the uks improvement down to a drop in female unemployment and narrowing of the gender pay gap but it found many women in britain were

microsofts chief executive satya nadella earned infamy for his declaration that women should not bother to ask for raises instead he suggested in october they should have faith that the system will reward them appropriately refraining from asking for a raise he added is actually good karma when his remarks were greeted with howls of outrage nadella backpedalled at the speed of light less than a year later microsoft was sued by a former employee katie moussouris now chief policy officer at hackerone alleging gender bias moussouris claimed that she was only one of a number of women at microsoft who earned less than their male counterparts moussouris also alleged that men received preferential treatment in promotions and systematically received more favorable job reviews there is no way to know whether moussouriss claims are accurate because microsoft does not disclose any data about the extent to which men and women are paid differently for doing similar jobs that may soon change if arjuna capital succeeds in placing a resolution before microsofts shareholders and convincing enough of them to vote in favor of it thus requiring the company to publicly disclose that information for the first time and helping women make up their minds whether its really enough to trust to karma or not arjuna the activist arm of baldwin brothers an investment advisory firm is targeting seven highprofile technology firms in search of precisely this information shareholders of ebay expedia facebook and google will vote on proposals that would result in the creation of reports detailing the percentage pay gap between male and female employees spelling out both corporate policies in an attempt to address how the companies would set about closing or narrowing that gap and specific targets arjuna is still discussing getting the proposal on to the agenda of adobes annual meeting and the draft resolution has just been presented to microsoft which meets in december a seventh company amazon is fighting back its lawyers argue that the request to report on plans to reduce the gender pay gap is impermissibly vague and misleading since believe it or not there are too many possible definitions of gender pay gap available amazon it seems is struggling with the definition of gender pay gap and cant figure out how it would do this properly yes really its asking the securities and exchange commission sec for permission to leave the shareholder proposal off its ballot anyone who has looked in even a cursory fashion at the economics of the technology universe shouldnt be surprised by the existence of a gender pay gap joint venture silicon valley reported last year that men in silicon valley reported earning as much as more than their female counterparts of course some of that happens because women dont have the same skills and dont hold the same kinds of highpaid positions but as top technology ceos like marc benioff of salesforce and brian krzanich of intel have discovered sometimes to their astonishment its sometimes due to internal pay policies benioff launched what he called the womens surge after recognizing that all his senior staff members were men but when two of his senior women came to him to point out that many women probably were being paid less than their male counterparts in the wake of a review of all salaries companywide he was stunned to realize they were right thats now being corrected one salary at a time intel which arjuna hails for achieving equity on pay set up a m fund at the beginning of last year those monies were earmarked to improve the diversity of the companys workforce and make it a more hospitable work environment as well as to finance scholarships krzanich noted that a key motivation for his backing of the companys initiatives was that he has two daughters of his own i want them to have a world thats got equal opportunity for them he told reporters at the time rather than one that is dominated by the bro culture of gamers the fact arjuna has already logged apple in the win column is particularly notable it confirmed that it has achieved equal pay that is intriguing given that only last month shareholders soundly defeated a shareholder proposal that would have required the company to increase the diversity of both its board of directors and its senior management team more aggressively apples executive team currently is almost exclusively made up of white men its eightperson board includes two women one of whom andrea jung is asian and an african american man with a new pay equity law on the books in california there is at least the basis for a lot more public discussion about what women in silicon valley are paid in both absolute and relative terms women able to document that they are paid less will be able to seek redress but even if a wizard or fairy godmother were to appear and level the playing field it would not solve all the issues women face in the world of technology demographic data doesnt tell the full story and even being well compensated doesnt mean you can put up with everything else that gets flung your way as ellen paos trials literal and rhetorical last year revealed women who try to be in the vanguard can end up in a toxic work environment female entrepreneurs report being hit on for sex by potential backers some female employees recount coping with casual sexism in a maledominated workplace more money and leaning in may not be enough admittedly weve got a long long way to go before we can even talk about getting past the quantitative problem when some companies dont even acknowledge that there might be a problem but its all part of the same package to the extent that women are underrepresented in silicon valley technology firms and that they are underpaid its probably linked to the fact that some women who might be qualified to do those jobs feel unwelcome within what is still a brogrammer culture in many parts of the technology world simply because of their gender not convinced consider the now infamous techcrunch disrupt hackathon in san francisco when entrepreneurs presented ideas that included an app titstare which as its name suggests lets you stare at tits as well as circleshake a game app involving simulating masturbation so by all means applaud and support arjunas efforts but until women are not just present and well paid but also welcomed as genuine peers at every level throughout silicon valley and the technology world and are able to be productive and serve as mentors to younger women and men alike well just be left staring at data,2016-03,microsofts chief executive satya nadella earned infamy declaration woman bother ask raise instead suggested october faith system reward

i have been paying into my schools childcare voucher scheme run by sodexo for seven years but when i tried to make a payment for halfterm childcare my account was empty my carefully saved electronic vouchers had expired with no warning it has never been made clear that the vouchers expire after months unlike other schemes such as edenred and kiddivouchers sodexo said it could not investigate until i told them how much money i had lost my youngest child is now five and i assumed the credit in the scheme could be used until he was not just for the next months a colleague also had some vouchers expire because sodexo doesnt always use the oldest vouchers first when making payments to providers it did refund some money very quickly once i gave them a guesstimate as to how much was in there but said it wasnt the usual practice what happens in july when the vouchers are due to expire again this is my money which i have paid into the scheme in good faith this important information should be flagged up not hidden in the small print pb southampton hampshire childcare vouchers are a useful and valuable employee benefit but even as an electronic currency can be an administrative headache as you have found we were surprised by this major oversight by such a large company which also affects other colleagues and presumably thousands of other workers across the uk its not as if you had any choice and were able to shop around for your vouchers as the schools scheme was chosen by the headteacher we contacted sodexo which confirmed that all its childcare vouchers carry an month expiry date from the date of purchase if vouchers do come close to expiry or actually expire the account holder can contact sodexos customer care team and request they be reissued a sodexo spokeswoman said upon receiving pbs enquiry our customer care team was able to rectify the situation pbs enquiry brought to our attention that some customers may not be aware of the expiry date we take feedback very seriously and have identified changes to our internal process and childcare portal in order to improve our communications we checked its website and the expiry deadline is indeed now on the childcare portal where parents log into their accounts but in our view it is still too buried among the small print and lengthy tampcs we also wonder why there is an expiry date at all it seems unfair

i am my husband is years older and we have a fouryearold son our parenting methods are very different my husband reprehends our son and puts him down and i have to protect him i want my son to love his dad instead of fearing him or feeling resentful and to grow up confident and emotionally strong what can i do it sounds as if your disparate styles of parenting are threatening your bond with your husband while the advice would usually be to make sure both parents are united in their parenting approach and certainly this is the ideal there are times when it might be best to temporarily prioritise your sons wellbeing while working to establish a united front with your husband too often people reprimand their child and send the message that the childs natural impulses are innately bad rather than focusing on the behaviour not working in a given context if you havent already this would be an important discussion to have with your husband perhaps with a therapist if it cant be done alone many of my husbands and my couples therapy sessions focus on how we are as parents not surprisingly how we parent our children often mirrors how we interact with our spouse and the world around if this is not possible you would need to find a way to set a boundary with your husbands approach while letting your son know that it is his behaviour that is being addressed and not his core self as an example if i see my husband approaching our son in a way that doesnt resonate with my values i say what behaviour is not working this works more effectively because my husband and i have discussed it when not around my son if your bond with your husband is strong he wont be confused about why you might stand up for your son it is always important to revisit this disconnection later however when your son is not there and to let your husband know how important it is to you that you are both on the same page when it comes to setting limits for your son two books you could read and discuss together are nodrama discipline by daniel j siegel and tina payne bryson and parenting without power struggles by susan stiffelman hopefully these will help you to form a more united and empathic

i am writing after returning from a weeks holiday with my son his partner and their two children who are both under five i have been concerned for several years that their management of their childrens sleep and meals is chaotic causing all four of them a great deal of distress having recently seen it under the same roof i am at my wits end to know how to help them or how best to cope myself i know holidays are stressful but their daily routines were already very fragile there was a scene on holiday when both children refused to eat their high tea my son exploded with rage some china smashed on the floor the children howled and their mother took them away to bed where they all immediately fell asleep it was disturbing to witness and afterwards i absented myself from earshot of their mealtimes i get very tense just watching their mother offer them large pieces of chocolate shortbread andor large quantities of milk within an hour or less of their high tea both children still drink large quantities of milk first thing in the morning before breakfast before bedtime and midafternoon they have to be coaxed to eat solid food at breakfast are given snacks all morning pick at lunch and then there are further crisps chocolate cake and milk in the afternoon they are given their main meal at pm which is mostly thrown away i am wary of trying to talk to my son he has been dismissive of mild comments i have made in the past and i have a polite but distant relationship with his partner i do not know how to help without provoking a breakdown in my relationship with them but feel i ought to do something more constructive than arranging to absent myself from mealtimes i love my grandchildren dearly and get on well with them both adults are very sleepdeprived and my son has a demanding job he is irritable surly and subject to temper outbursts when frustrated with the children his partner is more placid but also falls asleep at odd times leaving my son to cope they seem stuck the children are clean and healthy and their parents intelligent and otherwise competent how can i help my son handle his frustrations and negotiate small changes not the enormous task of reforming their whole regime and how should i accomplish this for myself its immensely frustrating seeing people making life more difficult for themselves especially when they do the same thing over and over again i agree that giving unhealthy snacks before a meal every day seems like insanity but sometimes people do that when they are seeking shortterm solutions to problems they are too exhausted to deal with im sure you remember how tiring being a parent is especially in those early years when sleep deprivation can be really acute and youre finding your feet you often cant see the wood for the trees and lose perspective you simply dont see that changes to the way you handle things might change outcomes it does take a brave person to say maybe you need to do this differently and the advice though well meant is hardly ever well received when from a family member so even if you were bold and said dont give the children huge snacks before dinner it wouldnt make it happen being on holiday is a weird set up anyway is it indicative of how it is in their everyday life do you think deirdre dowling a child and adult psychotherapist who has worked extensively with children childpsychotherapyorguk says underfives are full of difficult powerful feelings we can almost forget what it was like she feels the key may be if you can give practical support lower your expectations and offer your son and his wife practical support no one can think when theyre emotional and no one can survive without sleep could you offer to look after the children for a weekend say to give your son and daughterinlaw a break are you worried about your son if you are beyond the childrens routines could you spend a bit of one on one time with him it doesnt have to be for very long and you shouldnt try to prise open how he feels but if he feels connected with you safer he may open up a bit more does your daughterinlaw have her mother around i agree that your son seems highly strung but your daughterinlaw may well be depressed i think the way forward is to support the parents as best you can to enable them to parent to the best of their ability concentrate not on the childrens routines or lack of bedtimes but on your son and his wife if things get heated and frantic dont sit there in silence dont absent yourself from the room these responses can come across as judgmental and uncaring instead say how can i help that is a great phrase kind empowering helpful and it puts the parent in charge with you as ancillary you may also be really surprised at the response your

the average female wage in australia remains of the average male wage and the median female wage is still only of the median for men a gender pay gap that has remained shamefully steady over the past years these are just some of the figures released last week in the australian bureau of statistics abs gender indicators report which paint a dire picture of the enduring economic disadvantage for australian women the figures also show that one in five employed women with dependent children work without any paid leave entitlements at all twice the rate of men while more than of women but less than of men work in parttime jobs which tend to have more insecure conditions when theyre not at work women keep working spending more time on domestic activities than men do hours minutes per day compared with hour and minutes per day for men and on childcare minutes versus minutes each day and even when women retire the disadvantage continues men aged in had an average superannuation balance of while women the same age averaged only for lisa heap the womens organiser at melbournes trades hall international womens day on march provides an opportunity to discuss these ongoing problems with womens economic insecurity and crucially to organise against them as a result in victoria international womens day will run for a week while iwd events take place around the world on march trades hall has scheduled a festival of commemorative events to take place in melbourne from march on offer are panel events exhibitions a wikipedia hackathon a big party and even a book club our festival is a deliberate strategy of outreach to working women union and nonunion heap said the attempt is to encourage women in victoria to speak out about their working lives and conditions so trades hall can assist them to mobilise promoted by the un international womens day is commemorated around the world with local variations protest marches celebratory breakfasts female drummers on the streets of montevideo in uruguay gifts of flowers in italy and france courageous rallies of feminists in iran trades halls focus on womens rights at work makes the melbourne event close in spirit to iwds origins as an explicitly industrial event the very first international womens day was held in america in organised by local socialists in celebration of an earlier strike by the international ladies garment union in new york that had seen thousands of female workers walk out in protest at oppressive sweatshop conditions their slogan wed rather starve quick than starve slow an international meeting of socialists in copenhagen a year later revived the idea to establish a womens day so as to recognise womens working rights and demand womens suffrage by the first international marches added to these demands of womens rights to work to vocational training and to an end to workplace discrimination its now years later but here in australia just as many others those demands have not yet been met its women with experiences like kaylha ho to whom initiatives like lisa heaps make the difference ho was once a victim of a dodgy labour hire contractor who deployed her to work for notorious food processing company covino paid below minimum wages she was pressured and intimidated by the standover culture of her supervisors to remain silent but the solidarity that grew among the women at covino and the support of male colleagues empowered her ho was one of the women who brought the shocking conditions of their exploitation to public attention shes now a union organiser and will be spending international womens day addressing mps at victorias parliament house on the subject of gendered work inequality and its intersection with racism and other forms of disadvantage stories of exploitation of workers in particular females on farms continue to roll in we need to take action to stop this ho told guardian australia the need for australian women to organise in their own industrial interests is clear to the united voice union organiser tamika hicks who is spending iwd week planning actions in support of the exploited women workers in the early childhood sector australian early childhood educators have certificate iiis and diplomas that are weighted just the same and require the same rigour to attain as comparable qualifications for maledominated industries she says but on average were getting paid less than them of course its a gender pay justice issue of our industry is female dog groomers get more money an hour than women trained to educate children so do on average financial planners metalworkers and aviation mechanics hicks knows families cant afford an increase in childcare costs making it the governments responsibility to meet the educator pay gap but again the issues are intersectional although effective childcare is crucial to retaining womens participation in the workforce hicks knows the battle ahead is a hard one as a country she tells me we spend one of the lowest percentages on early childhood care and education in the oecd hicks takes great inspiration from zelda daprano a feminist activist veteran from the australian equal pay struggles of recognising that underneath breakfasts flowers drums marches and the occasional violent crackdown lies a reality that there is no social equality without economic equality weve got to reignite women into believing they do not need to accept inequity says hicks thats whats staring us all right in the face,2016-03,average female wage australia remains average male wage median female

if you are a woman applying for a job having another woman in the final candidate pool could significantly improve your chances by according to a recent report when there is only one woman she does not stand a chance of being hired but that changes dramatically when there is more than one the reports authors wrote in the harvard business review on tuesday when there was only one woman or minority candidate in a pool of four finalists their odds of being hired were statistically zero but when we created a new status quo among the finalist candidates by adding just one more woman or minority candidate the decision makers actually considered hiring a woman or minority candidate the report was based on three different studies conducted by researchers at the university of colorados leeds school of business in the first study undergraduate students were deciding between three job candidates some of which had what the reports authors called stereotypically black names the study found that if the majority of finalists were white participants tended to recommend a white candidate and if majority of finalists were black they would recommend a black candidate in the second study students made a similar decision but this time based on gender in the third study the researchers looked at finalists considered for jobs at a university of those finalists received job offers over a threeyear period the average hiring pool for this study was four finalists while some might consider these candidate pools small a typical corporate job listing receives applications on average those resumes are then sorted either by software or a recruiting manager and are narrowed down to a pool of four to six finalists who are then called in for an interview the report was authored bystefanie k johnson and david r hekman both assistant professors and elsa t chan a phd candidate at the university on april the national equal pay day they presented their findings at the white house among the feedback they received was shock at the fact that one minority or female candidate in the finalist pool is not enough according to johnson so many companies for such a long time have been working to get a woman in the pool we have to get one woman in the pool we have to get one minority in the pool and thats been human resources effort to at least get one minority candidate she explained and what this paper says is that its not enough to include just one female or one minority candidate in the pool to make yourself feel better it isnt a true diversity effort the researchers themselves were surprised at how much the subjects in their studies fell in line with the status quo i was extremely shocked by the findings hekman told the guardian one of the more interesting findings was that people who were the most sexist and the most racist were also the most likely to be sensitive to the bias johnson said maybe thats what the future research should look at whats the thought process here said johnson because i have been in hiring situations where people are like well we cant just hire this person because they are a minority but if you didnt know they were minority you might have hired the person anyway if you are pigeonholed as that one minority no one really looks at their qualifications they just look at the fact that they are a woman to those worried that including a second minority or female candidate to the finalist pool is a type of affirmative action or reverse discrimination against white men researchers point out the breakdown of the us workforce according to the most recent jobs report from the us department of labor there are million white men in the workforce and about million white women and while particular minorities make up a smaller portions of the workforce there are million africanamerican men million africanamerican women million hispanic men and million hispanic women altogether they make up million people in the workforce furthermore the argument that allwhite male candidate pools are due to skills shortages among people of color and women also doesnt hold up in of men and of women had graduated college according to the us census bureau a new report published by the economic policy institute also found that recent young black college graduates aged t currently have an unemployment rate of higher than the peak unemployment rate for young white college during the recession which was this is the solution for this huge problem of diversity in organizations said hekman its simple how do you get more diversity at the top how do you get more diversity anywhere how do you make a more balanced organization this is it have two women have two minority candidates johnson and her colleagues agree that their report is not a definitive piece of research on the subject to be sure our findings would need to be replicated in order to see how these effects play out in other contexts and we should note that the study results have not appeared in a peerreviewed journal they wrote in hbr however we think these results are a great foundation for future research to build on as a society we have spent a lot of time talking about our diversity problem but have been slow to provide solutions we believe this get two in the pool effect represents an important first step to overcoming unconscious biases and ushering in the racial and gender balance that we want in organizations,2016-04,woman applying job another woman final candidate pool could significantly improve chance according recent report one woman doe stand

for every selfie taken or pair of highheeled shoes bought lying in wait is someone quick to tell you that your photographs or footwear have not empowered you those clothes not empowering your tv choices no way it all goes hand in hand with the seemingly endless are you a feminist if discourse are you a feminist if you watch the world cup is it feminist to shave your armpits but not your legs can you call yourself feminist if you like rap music or violent films or once bought a glossy overpriced celebrity magazine at the airport because you missed your flight and had nothing else to read who knows i dont what i do know is that the feminist discussion that often comes with it is a distraction a distraction that i for one cannot wait to be rid of last week the guardians hadley freeman argued that empowerment had lost its meaning citing selfies and spanx as just two examples in which women have had empowerment marketed to them but i think this perpetuates a stale conversation sometimes its just not that deep whether its narcissistic or not people can simply like taking photos of themselves women arent saying that all selfies all the time are always feminist for a lot of women especially those of us who arent white and middle class the endless backandforth analysis of whether every individual choice is or isnt feminist is something we dont have the time for class is a big part of this many of the things that women are told can never be empowering clothes makeup messy nights out on the town are easily affordable to middleclass women if youve never felt disempowered because of the money you dont have how can you understand why so many workingclass women feel powerful accessing a lifestyle that capitalism has dangled in front of them for so long womens politics should not and in my opinion does not revolve around defending the snaps women take of themselves on nights out yes as a black woman it can feel political to love my appearance in a world that constantly tells me to hate the way i look however the implication that my politics end there perpetuates the sexist idea that my appearance and how much i care about it can be a basis for dismissing the rest of what i have to say take the discussion about sex work feminists who say sex work is not empowering should be challenged and they often are but not by the sexworkerrights movement sex workerled organisations arent talking about empowerment and many actively resist attempts by the media to push them into that frame instead they tend to focus on criminalisation poverty and survival but when these conversations are misrepresented they paint sex workers and their allies as merely battling for fluffy empowerment choice feminism seems to be a phrase mainly used to caricature young womens thoughtful feminist organising i agree that we shouldnt unthinkingly celebrate each other for the choices we make but rather than attacking selfies and sex workers it would be good to see some selfreflection from more established feminists from sisters uncut to the sex worker open university gal dem zine to action for trans health fourthwave feminists are hard at work yes the selfies we do or dont take can be great sometimes theyre empowering other times not but they dont define our politics,2016-04,every selfie taken pair highheeled shoe bought lying wait someone quick tell photograph

i met my fiance on a blind date about five years ago we moved in together after a year of dating bought a house after a year and then he proposed after being together for four years when we first met and began dating his sister lived away she moved back home after he and i began living together it was clear that she and i did not get along going through the normal awkward family events his sister doesnt like the same things we do we have tried inviting her to things but shes uninterested and shows everyone videos on her phone exclaiming each time isnt that funny of course she doesnt show me until i ask their mother and i got along and now we dont my fiance is sick of me complaining i am not quite sure what to do he supports me in that he affirms his sister is jealous of all his girlfriends but does nothing to help remedy her behaviour the mum said she wants us to have a therapeutic mediation and i had to talk my fiance into it because he thinks his sister is just acting out but shes telling people very hurtful things about me i just want to confront the problem because clearly his sister is hiding behind their mother on top of all of this its six months until we get married im beginning to think i just need to cancel the wedding i want a family to want me not talk about me behind my back the situation you describe is more common than you think with sibling relationships interfering with married ones and the sibling who is married trying to keep their spouse happy and also the sibling the jealousy seems to be more acute when its oppositesex siblings but you can also get samesex siblings causing havoc i contacted stella vaines a psychoanalytical couples psychotherapist bpcorguk vaines explains that sibling relationships tend to get overdetermined when there is not much parental presence especially the parent of the opposite sex in this case it appears your fiances sister is the one with more of an attachment to her brother and vaines thinks it significant that theres no mention of the father is he around was your fiance a father figure to his sister more than a sibling is guilt i wonder playing a part here does he feel disloyal to his sister by going off vaines also wonders if your fiance has found someone you who could give voice to his own disowned feelings in other words he may have found someone who can vocalise his own feelings about his sister someone who wont put up with the situation he may have done this because he cant himself say how he feels for all sorts of complicated reasons maybe to do so would cause too much upset in the family but you too need to look at why you are with someone who as vaines puts it cant put you first is this a pattern you are repeating something you are used to perhaps you do need to look at what the situation is triggering in you not because you are to blame for it youre not but it may help you to reach an understanding and therefore a resolution if something in this werent hitting a nerve your fiances sisters actions would largely short circuit an ultimatum however easy it is for others to prescribe is not really the answer i asked vaines how your fiance might be feeling and she thinks he would be feeling very torn if you force him to choose this will sow the seeds for huge resentment and drive a wedge between you and the rest of the family i hope that such drastic action wont be necessary what i find interesting says vaines is that you are looking to the mother for a solution if you want to be a grownup couple you need to separate out both of you from your family of origin you need to explore these issues together there is no quick fix but if with some couples therapy your fiance comes to an understanding about his relationship with his sister something will shift within him he can still be loving towards her but he can become more assertive i do think your fiance needs to take more responsibility for whats happening and to stop being so passive you cant force him to do this you can however choose whether or not to put up with the situation you do need to be careful of not becoming the third sibling with the mother lording it over the three of you if you walk away from this relationship entirely your choice it needs to be because you want to not because youve been pushed out by his sister also as vaines says if you dont get a better understanding of situations like these they will just recreate themselves your fiance will continue to find his sister a problem and you may find yourself in a similar situation this does speak to something unresolved in each of you if youre not sure about marrying there is a third choice between stay or cancel postpone your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the guardian kings place

older women are most likely to feel unsafe walking alone after dark but among the least likely to be attacked according to a guardian analysis of crime survey data meanwhile young men tend to express few fears about their safety but experience more personal crime than any other group the analysis comes as crime statistics show a increase in reported offences involving violence against the person the survey asked almost people aged and over living in england and wales how safe they felt walking alone after dark the findings were positive threequarters said they felt either very safe or fairly safe and just said they felt very unsafe however women were much more likely to report feeling unsafe than men with two women in every five saying they felt somewhat unsafe almost one in eight women reported feeling very unsafe more than one in five women in the oldest age category said they felt very unsafe the wider ons crime survey for the same period involved more than people it showed that older women experienced personal crime much less frequently than younger ones the general trend was that the older the person the less likely they were to experience personal crimes a broad category of infractions the majority of which take place in public spaces women in the oldest age categories were among the least likely to be mugged or suffer common assault they were however at a higher risk than women in some younger age categories when it came to theft from the person specifically stealth theft which includes pickpocketing a recent guardian callout showed that while many people feel safe after dark fear stops some from venturing out i rarely go out alone and never after dark a woman in her mids said talking to friends they all agree that travelling alone at night can be very frightening and is something we all try to avoid if possible another woman also in her mids explained as a female i dont feel as strong or able to defend myself as i think a man might i worry about sexual violence most although as i get older i am becoming more concerned about mugging a woman in her late s described being tired of being hyperaware of keeping vigilant and not feeling safe until im inside clutching my keys while knowing i probably couldnt do much damage with them choosing my way home by whichever way is busier even if its longer wearing shoes i know i could run in and taking my hair out of a ponytail so its not as easy to grab its exhausting and i dont see that itll ever end although fewer men said they felt unsafe while walking after dark a similar pattern emerged when it came to age among unders a tiny proportion or less said they felt very unsafe after dark rising to and in the oldest age categories younger men expressed fewer fears but were more likely to experience crime the gap was most pronounced when it came to violent crimes there were incidents of common assault per men in the category in the year to march compared to just in the oldest age

a national ad campaign aimed at stopping domestic violence before it occurs by challenging gender inequality will be rolled out from sunday the stop it at the start ads will air on tv and in cinemas and will be accompanied by an online and print campaign the campaign aims to break the cycle of violence by highlighting pervasive negative attitudes towards women and by encouraging parents teachers and other influencers of young people to rethink their language we are trying to hit directly at that attitudinal and habitual behaviour that sits in the mind of particularly young men and boys the social services minister christian porter told reporters they the ads are designed to confront all of us on our attitudes they are confronting in the way we all get confronted from time to time when a trusted source tells us a home truth about some habit or behaviour we have behaved in perennially which is not good the minister for women michaelia cash said the government was taking a holistic approach to tackling domestic violence disrespecting women does not always lead to violence against women but certainly all violence against women began with that fundamental lack of respect she said that is what this campaign is all about the campaign costs m and is jointly funded by the federal and state and territory governments it comes shortly after the government released a report that shows high levels of victimblaming among young people research found boys and young men were quick to externalise their behaviour often blaming women the sex discrimination commissioner kate jenkins who took up her post on monday backed the campaign young people learn their values and develop their attitudes at home and at school and at university and our research is telling us very clearly we need to urgently focus on the young she told the national press club they showed a higher level of attitudinal support for violence against women than older age groups and they were also less likely to support gender equality in decisionmaking within relationships that is they were more likely to believe that men should call the shots so this is not a matter of crusty old men needing to be moved on we now have a new generation that is coming though that hold these attitudes labor and the greens support the m campaign which will be phased out over three years but both parties want the government to reinstate funding cut to legal centres if we dont see those cuts reversed then all of the governments pretty words will be for nothing the greens senator larissa waters said but its not just about bringing us back to where we were two years ago we have to increase funding so that womens refuges can be built there is always space for women who need it and theres always someone on the other end of the phone when a woman calls a call centre for help labor wants extra funding put towards womens shelters to cope with the surge in women leaving abusive relationships its now up to the government to reverse its cuts to frontline services for women and children escaping violence so that services can cope with the added demand a national campaign will create labors spokeswoman on the prevention

when it comes to preventing violence against women australia has made history in the last few weeks for many years experts have stressed the need to tackle gender inequality as the key driver of violence against women but until recently there has been only limited support for dealing with this elephant in the room instead myths and misconceptions that it is uncontrollable jealousy that drives mens violence against women for example are regularly bandied around some focus on a single factor often alcohol to explain the problem and while alcohol does sometimes play a part it is not the cause of the epidemic of mens violence against women in this country harmful alcohol consumption is certainly a huge problem in australia but it is not only men who drink in harmful ways and even for those who do many or most are never violent it is also true that alcohol may sometimes trigger or exacerbate acts of violence but it still doesnt explain why the pattern of violence in australia is so overwhelmingly gendered for many people violence seems like an individual problem perpetrated by only a few bad men whose behaviour is way outside the social norm the suggestion that disrespectful attitudes towards women actually underpin many popular dominant and socially normal understandings of masculinity in our culture has been too confronting for many but now finally australians from all walks of life including many of our politicians are taking a moreclear eyed look at the social and cultural context in which this violence arises collectively we are making the links between the broader conditions of gender inequality evident in attitudes behaviours and social structures and the alarming levels of violence against women in this country in fact a new m campaign will be launched by commonwealth state and territory governments this weekend to do just this of course we must adequately resource those services responding to current violence in fact such services will increasingly need more funding because higher awareness of the issue means more women feel confident to seek help however what is now being recognised is that we will never stem the tide of violence against women in this country if we dont intervene upstream and address the socially entrenched drivers of this violence on march the victorian royal commission into family violence recommended that the victorian government adopt a prevention strategy in addition to but separate from response efforts with dedicated funding and performance measures making prevention a priority component of a statewide family violence action plan last wednesday this was followed by the announcement of m in funding from the victorian budget to deliver of the royal commissions most urgent recommendations over the next two years of this m will go directly into upstream prevention measures including rolling out respectful relationships education in every government school in victoria from prep to year introducing victorias first gender equality strategy and helping local communities play their part in preventing violence also in the last two weeks the final council of australian governments coag advisory panel on reducing violence against women and their children report was released the panel headed by former victorian police chief ken lay and rosie batty recommended that all commonwealth state and territory governments commit to a longterm national prevention strategy as the report states a new mindset is needed to achieve generational and lasting change an approach that focuses on empowering women driving change among men challenging pervasive violence supportive community attitudes and improving gender equality the government ad campaign that kicks off this weekend supports this new mindset by encouraging parents family members teachers coaches and employers to look at their own attitudes and behaviours around how gender equality and respectful relationships are inadvertently influencing the attitudes of young people all of the above strongly echoes the current evidence outlined in change the story a shared national framework for the primary prevention of violence against women and their children released last year by our watch with vichealth and australias national research organisation for womens safety anrows further demonstrating the spread of this new kind of thinking the south australian parliamentary committee report is the third in less than a month to acknowledge the critical importance of addressing gender inequality to end violence against women the elephant in the room is no longer being ignored the research is consistent and the message is now loud and clear we cannot stop australias scourge of violence against women without squarely tackling gender inequality of course any challenge to the status quo generates resistance this is especially true when we are shining a light on something as deeply entrenched as ideas and social norms about gender about masculinity and about the place status and role of men and women in society but when we are living with such extreme levels of violence something has got to change yes confronting gender inequality is personally and politically challenging but the time has come to acknowledge that we cannot avoid it any longer,2016-04,come preventing violence woman australia ha made

the governments hour free childcare offer has come under fire in a new report that claims almost half of early years providers fear they may be driven out of business as a result of the policy the sector has been warning the government that the offer while attractive to working parents is underresourced and will lead to a significant funding gap for many providers the study conducted by the preschool learning alliance the largest early years membership organisation in england found that of providers who took part in their online survey said there was a risk that they could close as a result of the doubling of the free childcare offer for three and fouryearolds from to hours almost half said they would have to cut the number of places they offer to other age groups and did not feel confident they would have the capacity to meet demand for places of the childcare providers who took part are planning to deliver the hour offer while say they arent planning to with just more than a half still undecided six out of of them said they thought the new offer which is due to be introduced next year would have a negative financial impact on their business neil leitch the alliances chief executive said these figures are a stark warning of what could happen if the government insists on rolling out an underfunded underresourced free entitlement offer he welcomed government plans to increase average early years funding rates but said that with extra costs elsewhere including the introduction of the national living wage there would still be a funding gap for early years providers the department for education seems to be working on the assumption that the sector will simply fall in line and roll out the offer whether or not the funding is there to support it but it cannot expect providers to put the sustainability of their businesses at risk to fulfil a manifesto promise that they didnt make and that wasnt properly thought through in the first place leitch said the fact that of survey respondents currently deliver the hour offer but only are definitely planning to deliver the hour offer speaks volumes last month the national audit office warned that the education department faced a number of risks with its implementation of the new hour entitlement including concern from childcare providers about funding mps on the public accounts committee are expected to raise some of these issues when they question the department about the potential impact of the policy on wednesday a department spokesperson said the average funding rate paid to providers was being increased by an additional m a year latest figures show million children the vast majority are taking up the universal hours offer they said with our plan to double the free childcare offer for working parents we expect takeup numbers to rise that ambition is supported by the huge levels of interest in our early implementers scheme which will trial the hour offer a year ahead of schedule

at one time or another every one of my four daughters has asked me the question who is your favourite daughter my answer is always the same i dont have a favourite which is naturally a lie but also the truth before unpacking that thought its worth considering the importance if there is any of being thought of as the favourite whether favourite child favourite parent or even favourite spouse if youve been unduly liberal with your marriage vows the last two of these categories are easily clarified if you are the favourite parent of one of your children then you are foolish if you think it counts for much a favourite parent may simply be the worst parent that one most incapable of keeping discipline your favourite spouse is the one you are married to but is it ok to have a favourite child this question is perhaps misconceived because whether it is ok or not it is something most of us will feel at some time however inappropriate our better selves deem it to be i always deny having a favourite when asked by my children because any such answer however qualified is certain to be misinterpreted because parents like children are fickle and such an answer is given to change over time and circumstance but even if it doesnt having a favourite child is a shallow thing in the same way that a favourite parent may simply be the one who is the most tractable the favourite child is often the one who causes the least anxiety and difficulty they may also be the child most inclined to give you the most consistent presentations of love or approval if you do entertain a favourite even temporarily it may not have anything to do with the childs intrinsic virtues or qualities any more than you choose someone to be a friend rather than an acquaintance not because they are better people but because they will more readily to adapt to your personality it may sound like i am wriggling a bit here on the horns of a dilemma and not being entirely frank perhaps that is true i am sure i know for instance when one of my children prefers their mother to their father and it is not always a matter of tractability but the amount of effort the parent puts into establishing intimacy however as a man i am slightly at a disadvantage when trying to establish intimacy as the gender gap operates most particularly in the teenage years none of my daughters have ever come to ask me about say menstrual issues bra fittings or boyfriend problems doubtless it feels good to be the favoured child although i wouldnt know as im pretty sure i wasnt my two more attractive personable and better behaved brothers were in my mind the clear favourites i suspect this has had an effect on the development of my personality an enduring need for approval and praise perhaps but although i doubt my parents liked me more than my brothers and i expect they had good reason i am certain they did not love me any less this is why i say it is both a lie and true to say that as a parent you have favourite children there are children who you may have fewer problems with but that is not really the same as having a favourite because the love is equal loving and liking are qualitatively different my daughters are all a delight and a trial in separate ways and to different degrees but in the matter of love there really is no distinction they may feel the situation to be otherwise from time to time but they would be wrong a parents love for their child is unlike almost any other phenomena that child will experience as they grow up it is outside comparison it is without measure and it is indiscriminate timlottwriter,2016-04,one time another every one four daughter ha asked question favourite daughter answer always dont favourite naturally lie also truth unpacking thought worth

its parents evening and im sitting across the table from laura and her dad they are the spitting image of each other slight darkhaired and scowling im smiling encouragingly as lauras dad rants at me inside im whitehot with rage ive been royally stitched up laura tells me youve been ignoring her pleas for help in lessons and that some days you wont even speak to her im not surprised shes not making progress you clearly just cant be bothered any more call yourself a head of maths she says shes learned more from the ta from you laura cant hide a little smirk beneath the fringe i think back to yesterdays lesson where she wrote miss is a bitch painstakingly all over her gcse paper for an hour instead of answering the questions the lesson before where i sat with her patiently trying to explain prime numbers while she stared at the wall and suggested i shut up i interrupt lauras dad and explain that laura is quietly disruptive in lessons that her stories of me ignoring her are outright lies his face darkens and the conversation turns ugly the deputy head arrives to deal with his concerns but now the battle lines have been drawn he sees me as the enemy and believes that his daughter would never tell an untruth the rest of the term will be spent with me trying to placate him while helping his daughter get her predicted cgrade as teachers we expect pupils to lie from time to time and we deal with them accordingly teaching explicitly through pshe or indirectly modelling the behaviour we expect we show them how to face up to mistakes and admit errors we resolve disputes and guide them towards honest relationships but everything gets much more complicated when a child like lauras lies are accepted by a parent as truth this is particularly topical a scientific study has confirmed this week that parents are terrible at spotting when their own offspring are lying parents were asked to look at videos of their own children and state whether they were telling the truth or not students and other parents were asked the same questions about the same videos and the answers were compared parents correctly assessed that their own child was lying just of the time compared with the other groups whose accuracy was and these findings suggest that the close relationship that parents share with their own children may be related to a bias toward believing their childrens statements and hence a failure to detect their lies said lead author angela evans ive had children say i wouldnt let them go to the toilet or that they definitely didnt steal my pen then later look shocked when it turned up in their pencil case similarly the line can be blurred we can all relate to the sinking feeling you get when a child in a lesson being observed by a senior staff member is asked and what are you supposed to be doing and they reply no idea is this the truth a careless lie or much worse a knowing one the implications could be careershattering figures from suggest at least allegations were made against teachers in that year along with against nonteaching staff around a third of these were found to be substantiated leaving twothirds that were unfounded malicious or simply inconclusive of course by the time such allegations reach investigation it is not just the parents who are assessing the childs story however they are usually the first person the child tells and as such it is crucial for teachers that parents are able to accurately evaluate their childs story as a parent as well as a teacher however im struggling i know that not believing a child when they are telling the truth can be extraordinarily damaging like many parents one of my priorities is making sure my children can talk to me about anything i have no doubt that the truth bias from the study exists it took finding a heap of sweet wrappers under my daughters bed for me to realise she had been stringing me along for several months but that doesnt help me when faced with a persuasive little face and a quick decision it should be about balancing the knowledge that we arent good at detecting our childrens lies with the need to be open to them when they confide in us the key has to be in creating a climate both at home and in the classroom where we actively discuss why we lie and when it is and isnt ok from a young age parents and teachers must share some of the responsibility for schooling children to believe that deception is wrong and honesty is right this is when the children see us their adult role models tell white and notsowhite lies we tell uncle henry his haircut looks great we tell our friend helen we cant make it out today because our child is sick we tell another teacher that we cant do their breaktime duty because we have a bad back we do our children a great disservice by failing to talk to them about this inconsistency and thinking they wont notice after all as we all know children lie to save face to get out of trouble and sometimes because they have started a habit they cant stop a good way to prevent the first two turning into the second might be by changing the way we speak to children instead of are you telling the truth forcing them into a defensive position say that you understand its difficult to be honest but its better to be open parents and teachers shouldnt be afraid to tell children about the times they have experienced the same thing and above all praise honesty rather than react snappily to bad behaviour but most of all parents please remember that teachers are on the same side as you we too want to help children develop in the right way so trust us when we tell you your beloved is fibbing and if youre wondering laura eventually cracked after i sat her down and told her the implications of her actions in fact were still in touch her lie was a symptom of her own personal issues as such things often are shes now a waitress at my local cafe sometimes the service isnt great but i havent ratted

the gap between british children from wealthy and disadvantaged backgrounds is growing because of a failure by the government to tackle inequalities in child health education and income according to a new unicef report warning that the uk is trailing behind a range of other developed countries by failing to reduce inequality in child wellbeing the uns childrens rights body directly criticised the government by predicting that its ambitions to eradicate child poverty were unlikely to materialise in the near future among key areas of concern britain was also ranked bottom out of countries for the disparities in healthy eating between children from differing social and financial backgrounds the study report card which is published on thursday is the latest highly critical view of the uk from the un and follows interventions such as the call by the bodys special investigator on housing for the scrapping of the bedroom tax we must be more ambitious for our children britain can and must do better said lily caprani unicef uks deputy executive director who called on the government to urgently adopt a childhood obesity strategy that promotes and supports healthy lifestyles for lowincome children it must also act to further reduce income inequality which includes protecting social transfers identifying a disparity in healthy behaviours among children as one of its key areas of concern the report said that the uk had the largest difference among all the countries studied in the levels of healthy eating consumption of fruit and vegetables between children from low and high socioeconomic status this was accompanied with with one of the largest gaps in the levels of physical activity inequality in education was also flagged with the uk being ranked th out of the countries behind slovenia poland and romania in reading maths and science denmark was ranked first in the reports findings while israel and turkey were found to have the highest levels of child inequality the uk was ranked th overall tied with germany greece and hungary aside from the criticisms unicef said that the uk performed better on the measure of income inequality where it sits seventh overall but it said that social transfers such as working tax credits nearly halve the relative income gap without the significant contribution of social transfers it is estimated that the income gap would be among the highest in europe the agency added the lack of progress means that ambitions to eradicate child poverty in the uk are unlikely to be realised in coming years the childrens commissioner anne longfield said in a reaction to the report that while children and young people in britain had great opportunities the report report highlighted the difficulties faced by up to a million children who continue to fare worse than the majority we know from other research that there has been progress in some areas rates of teen pregnancy and alcohol consumption have decreased but it is critical struggling families and children get the support they need particularly in early childhood before problems take hold said added it was because of this that longfield said she was backing proposals for an early years indicator to measure disadvantage as well as encouraging local authorities to revolutionise support provided to the most vulnerable children by applying for a share of recently announced government funding a government spokesperson said were working to eliminate child poverty and improving life chances for children and there are now fewer children in poverty we know theres more we can do and thats why weve introduced the national living wage which is increasing the incomes of the lowest paid all infant pupils can now get free school meals meaning million more children

is liz kendall right in an interview at the weekend she told the sunday times theres a lot of oldfashioned misogyny on the hardleft youve only got to look at the comments about me during the leadership campaign i was called a bitch a whore a seeyounexttuesday as they say on towie all because my political views werent the same as theirs the statement is on one level unarguable she was called those things repeatedly often in the same tweet but is she right to yoke the misogyny to the politics is there a strain of misogyny on the left that is both peculiar to it and peculiarly vicious and if so what is its mechanism is there anything particular to socialism that could fuel a scorn for women distinct from the more predictable and comprehensible sexism on the right we can dispense immediately with the argument that these slurs were hurled at kendall in particular and just happened to be sexist because so many of the popular ones are pretty well all mps in kendalls ideological and age bracket have come in for similar language and beneath it there is that familiar but hard to pin down insinuation that being a blairite is one thing but a female blairite is particularly risible that her wrongheadedness springs from her gender and that women such as these corrode solidarity it is never said so explicitly but it is there in the ferocity and of course its pretty unmistakable given the targets you dont see dan jarvis carpetbombed with seeyounexttuesdays there are those who argue that misogyny is hardwired into both the principles and the policy objectives of the hardleft and the evidence is there in issues such as the legalisation of sex work a debate where the ascription of misogyny can become the live element of the debate leapfrogging the issue itself there are feminist arguments both for and against the legalisation of sex work and misogynists on both sides too if you look at the openly stated aims of the left youd be searching a long time before you found open bigotry and yet that doesnt mean there isnt a problem at the cultural level historically sexism wasnt so much the dirty secret of the hardleft as of the union movement in the s it was a running joke that the reason it took many women so long to figure out that thatcher wasnt in fact furthering womens interests was because she smashed the unions which is exactly what a feminist would have done naturally given the fact that the union movement is doing so much work fighting discrimination this isnt a charge you could level now and the picture has always been mixed yet unionists can become utterly outraged by the mildest remark about their industrial heritage being quite patriarchal in outlook and often privileging and valorising male jobs over female ones as recently as five years ago the gmb was implicated in an outrageous equalpay failure by birmingham city council where women on the same pay grade as men cleaners v bin men for instance were earning far less in the starkest example a refuse collector took home more than in one year while women on the same level received less than when the female employees took the case to court and won the gmb claimed it as their victory since they had been representing the women yet it was as a result of union action in the s and s that bonuses for bin men and not for cleaners were won in the first place the indignation when anyone raises the lessthanperfectlyequal elements of unionist history is understandable and i think gets to the heart of why the left wont interrogate itself for sexism rightly unions see themselves as having given their lives to the pursuit of fairness if they dont always get it right nonetheless there are about a million better targets for a feminists ire but clearly from a feminist perspective all misogyny must be challenged if we waited until someone handed us a list of enemies in order of importance and then obeyed it the womens movement wouldnt exist the ugliest example of this fissure came with the socialist workers party furore in which a number of women alleged that they had been raped by a senior figure in the leadership the party set up a kangaroo court failed to pass on the charges to the police and busied themselves instead asking the women about how much they drank and how many sexual partners theyd had again at the time and to this day when you raise the issue swp members will give you a thorough explanation of why this is less important than smashing the system which is where violence against women indeed all violence comes from in the first place no compromise is possible between these two positions you either believe equality for women should take second place to equality generally or you believe equality for women is indivisible from general equality it cannot cede or defer to a battle over what is more important because nothing is more important they are parts of the same whole the galling thing is that this implacability creates the silence that allows this culture to persist a misogynistic ukipper will come out and say that women dont clean behind the fridge and suzanne evans or a woman like her can fight him but in a political culture built on equality and solidarity the charge is too catastrophic to discuss if you really are a misogynist you do not belong in the struggle for justice your entire identity is capsized this tendency is not so much hardleft as incredibly niche i would wager though i cannot prove that misogynists on the left are far fewer than they are in almost any other political environment the difference is that it runs directly counter to the account they give of themselves thats what makes it dispiriting and thats what it makes it stubborn,2016-04,liz kendall right

young women with vocational qualifications earn less than their male peers a significantly bigger pay gap than for those with academic qualifications according to new research men aged between and with a vocational qualification above gcse level earn on average an hour the trades union congress tuc found in an analysis of official figures women with the same qualification level earn only per hour the difference was higher than the gender pay gap of between young men and women with academic qualifications it was also higher than an overall gender pay gap of calculated from figures for gross hourly pay for workers aged between and the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said young women with vocational qualifications experience a huge gender pay gap partly because they work predominantly in sectors where pay is poorer in betterpaid sectors like engineering and construction women remain a rarity she said unless we challenge gender stereotyping and discrimination from the outset the situation is not going to improve unions employers and government must work together to provide better careers advice in schools and to support and improve training opportunities for all young people the tuc analysis found that in just one in vocational qualifications in construction were awarded to women and they received just of vocational qualifications in engineering and manufacturing by contrast in health and care women dominate with of vocational qualifications the government has been promoting vocational qualifications to tackle skills shortages and has vowed to create m apprenticeships by the end of the decade but a recent report claimed women were not benefiting from apprenticeships as much as men the report last month from the young womens trust found that although more women were now entering apprenticeships than men they were paid less than their male counterparts and were less likely to go on to gain employment the charity said the main reason was that women were still underrepresented within maledominated sectors which tend to be better paid and have better career prospects,2016-04,young woman vocational qualification earn less male peer

our daughter soninlaw sil and granddaughter visited us last year at the same time as our son and his partner and another couple when we were sitting down to eat our sil didnt come to the table but sat outside on the terrace drinking beer my husband asked why he didnt come to the table and he said he was not hungry after dinner our sil said that he would never trust people in the same profession as my sons partner he insisted such people were not to be trusted and added some less than complimentary words my husband and i felt he was being insulting we tried to stop him talking but he kept returning to the subject nobody laughed next morning i told our sil that he had been insulting to our sons partner and it was unacceptable he said it was a joke and i did not understand it we had a short intense argument after many exchanges with my daughter during which our sil stayed in his bedroom she said it was all my fault for being the way i was and criticising him for not having social graces my husband told her that our sil needed to apologise to our sons partner and to us for being so rude our daughter sided with her husband said that he knew that we had never liked him and he would not set foot in our house again we said our house would always be open to her and her daughter we have always treated our sil well and accepted him as part of the family we admired him as he came from a poor family and acquired a good education as did my husband our sil is not demonstrative towards our daughter there was never a sign of tenderness from him towards her i wonder if he is using her to achieve a financial security he wouldnt otherwise even without realising since this event we have spoken to our daughter and granddaughter via skype twice when he was not present before that we spoke on most weekends she skipped my birthday and christmas we dont believe we deserve this type of treatment we have a short yearly time together as a family so in the past we kept quiet now my husband thinks we should forget about our daughter i believe this is too extreme i understand i cannot make her talk to us or enjoy our previous laughter and conversation its her choice to take her husbands side how can we begin to reconnect i have cut the detail relating to what your sons partner does for a living as it could identify them but safe to say that it is a highly skilled job which takes many years of specialist training there is no denying that your sil sounds like a difficult man your longer letter says he has changed jobs many times and seems to bad mouth past employersees which hints at a man who perhaps cant take responsibility for his half of things it sounds to me as if your sil has several issues and can feel threatened by people especially those who have made something of themselves i guess it must be confusing and upsetting that your daughter chose him as a husband she may be very happy lets hope he magically transforms when hes at home with her youre right your husbands suggestion is extreme and unnecessary id like to know a little more about your husband in general is he very black and white about things just like children one cannot make adults meaningfully say sorry its a process that has to be arrived at naturally and subjectively so while your sil should not have behaved like this in the first place and should have apologised insisting someone says sorry doesnt work i think your sons partner had the best approach to the evening she was diplomatic despite feeling insulted i thought it was interesting that your daughter said that you had never liked him and wonder if this is true in your longer letter i picked this up even if you havent said anything she will have felt this i wonder what the dynamic is between her and her brother and if it looked to her as if you were favouring her brothers choice of partner over hers while your sils behaviour was spectacularly rude the detail of him not coming in for dinner is less easy to forgive than the possibly gauche comments about your sons partners job the ensuing row can cause massive schisms in a family this is how families become estranged family life often involves having to deal with people you dont care for or like very much and a plus you only see him once a year why dont you write to your daughter saying you very much regret what happened last year this is true and does not negate what happened or your sils behaviour say that you would like to reconnect with her and ask how can you do this ask what she needs she may not reply but it would be a powerful message to send her keep communications going with her and try not to offer advice or judgment only support its not easy but i think it will be worthwhile,2016-04,daughter soninlaw sil granddaughter visited u

the value of childcare in british homes washing and feeding families diy cleaning and collecting children from school contributes to a home production economy that is worth more than tn according to official government figures but while the value put on informal childcare has soared british households are doing less cleaning diy and gardening according to the data from the office for national statistics ons the figures are an extraordinary attempt to quantify the volume of work done in the home and put a price on what it would cost if that work was paid for the tn figure for compares with the annual tn for the official economy last year the ons estimated that the total number laundry loads put through britains household washing machines rose from bn in to bn in if households had to use a launderette and pay someone to do the ironing instead the cost would be bn a year mind you the ons assumes that british people iron only one in of the items they wash even sewing on spare buttons and knitting jumpers comes into the ons calculations it estimated that in the value of clothing services performed in the home was around bn britons spent three hours less cleaning our homes during the year in compared with a year earlier and one hour less on gardening and diy the ons cut by bn the value it put on these services compared with easily the fastest growing part of the household economy was childcare informal childcare by stayathome parents or relatives was worth bn in up from bn in and just bn in but the ons said the increase had less to do with an increasing workload of childcare going on in britains homes than the fact that if families paid for a childminder instead the hourly costs have risen steeply despite britains ageing population the ons said the number of adults relying on relatives for informal care in the home has remained largely static but the number of hours that each caredfor person needs has risen by a year adult care was valued at bn in the total bn value put on home production in is equal to of the total output of the british economy in the same year said the ons and while economic growth in the main economy has been sluggish at best over the past decade the household economy has been growing at more like the rates seen in emerging markets gross value added in the home has gone up by a year since said the ons far outpacing growth in the market economy the ons said that although the figures are outside the formal national accounts what it dubs the satellite accounts are important to gain a deeper understanding of the substitution of activities between the household and the market but it admits that it finds some of the results puzzling particularly under the household nutrition category where the ons attempts to put a value on home cooking shopping setting the table and washing up over the past decade british waistlines have expanded with obesity reaching crisis levels yet the ons estimates that in the home at least the number of calories consumed has been falling the total number of calories eaten in has been largely flat with average annual growth of negative between and this result is surprising given that the uk population has grown by between and however the impact of the population increasing is negated by a reduction in the number of calories eaten per person which declined between and another significant change is the value put on transport services provided by households this week record car sales were reported jumping to more than in march alone yet the number of miles driven by households to go to work or the shops collecting children from school etc remains significantly below the levels recorded a decade ago the ons said british households drove bn miles in which was up from bn the year before but down from bn in it attributed the fall to petrol costs and pressure on household budgets after the financial crash the latest fall in time spent cleaning gardening and doing up the house is part of a longerterm trend said the ons time spent on diy is down the most by since it said that the keenest diyers were younger adults who had just bought a home but with home ownership falling and people renting for longer diy is less popular it added that an ageing population is also less capable or willing to put up its own shelves and paint its own walls,2016-04,value

few laws can truly change society like those that govern parental leave which is probably why they have changed so slowly in a series of reluctant tweaks and fudges if you want to declare a turning point however april looks like it last year wasnt the first time that new parents got money from the government that was when the liberals national insurance act gave mothers a shilling grant to pay for a midwife nor was it the first time that parents were guaranteed time off that was in when the employment protection act gave women weeks leave and crucially the right to their old job back since then both the leave and the pay have been gradually improved for women but it was only a year ago that the opportunity to raise your children and sabotage your career was able to be shared almost equally between men and women certainly that was not the case in when new rules guaranteed leave to fathers for the first time a mighty two weeks paid at per week from april fathers were also allowed up to more weeks provided the mother had already returned to work collecting the rest of her statutory pay for the past year however the full weeks leave and weeks pay have been more or less freely available to both partners and about of all employed men have taken up the offer sen clarke took three months when our first son was born two and a half years ago my wife and i agreed that i would take over maternity duty for the last three months of his first year there was no financial logic to this apart from anything else maternitypaternity pay by then has stopped for either partner but we both agreed it would be good to share the leave and the ninemonth point seemed with weaning well under way a sensible moment for the transition a couple of weeks ago i came back to work at the guardian after a similar three months on paternity leave with our second son gender aside the inversion of roles was startling very quickly my wifes tales of the office seemed as irrelevant to me as mine must have to her when baby number two came along i made a conscious effort not to go on about desk moves or department politics i also quickly realised that being in the house all day did not necessarily mean that you had any scope to wash up after breakfast or indeed to eat breakfast and that even a nap for the baby could be surprisingly handson without the perspective that comes from the swap its easy for each partner to imagine the other relaxing at homein the childfree office while they do the hard work of looking after the childrenbringing home the bacon more than that though taking the leave gives you a change of outlook about family and work had i not done it i think it might have been possible to imagine that the children were an addition to my life rather than a fundamental change in it and that frightens me anxious mothers who worry about handing over to their partners can relax though mummy never stopped being the preferred parent for tearful babies but hopefully the boys enjoyed our time together they seemed to and maybe got the impression that people sometimes go to work and sometimes look after children and that this applies more or less equally to mummy and daddy to expectant or new fathers who are thinking of it i would say do it unless you are supremely empathetic you have no idea what its like for the mother otherwise it may completely alter your balance of priorities and if you time it right you get to see the first steps and hear the first words at first hand mike higgins took three months my first daughter was born in at that time i was working three days a week and though my wife was the primary carer i loved that experience i couldnt believe how much she changed every day the baby not my wifewhen daughter number two arrived i was working longer hours as a magazine editor and wouldnt have as much time with her so it was decided that id do three months additional paternity leave as it was called then when my wife went back to work after nine months towards the end of i had an office job at a largeish company and fortunately the hr was relatively simple to sort i was fortunate in another way though i didnt receive any paternity pay for those three months i could afford to save for it perhaps unsurprisingly i didnt know any other fathers then who had taken up a chunk of paternity leave beyond the statutory two weeks and i know only one person who has taken extended pat leave in the four years since reactions to my decision split down gender lines broadly male friends and colleagues were vaguely approving but a bit baffled are you joking youre really just going to write a novel arent you i love my kids that doesnt mean i want to actually raise them the many mothers i knew who had tossed their careers overboard for their families were encouraging but i sensed they were quite aware i would only be at the wheel for a brief few weeks there were a few storms en route i confess i did imagine my time at home to be more freewheeling than it turned out so the rolling deadlines caught me out mealtimes naps nursery pickups washingup laundry tidying it all piles up my wife had set me three rules that by pm when she returned from work the kids should be in bed the flat not be a total bombsite and dinner be under way in the face of the messy reality she quietly dropped them the fouryearold barely acknowledged the regime change she occasionally called me mummy in the first weeks but she sensed a vacuum in the transition of power and exploited it telly times and bed times were pushed what i hadnt realised was how small your geographical world becomes as a stayathome parent the pressure cooker sometimes boiled over outside the home the neighbourhood mums and they were all mums barely batted an eyelid i was welcomed in with the slightly weary sense that for you mike itll all be over by christmas and one dad who wishes he could have done it ruwan kodikara my son harrison was born in so unfortunately my wife kat and i missed out on shared parental leave spl kat is a forensic scientist which means she constantly has to refine her skills to keep up to date with developments in her field without spl she decided to take a year off but when she returned she had to go through aseries of retraining sessions when we decided to try for a baby and i looked into things such as parental leave we realised that policywise dads were largely ignored i remember asking our office manager about the companys paternityleave policy to which she replied im not sure really no ones ever taken it here before and so in the end i took two weeks paternity leave and then two weeks annual leave luckily my employer was very understanding and allowed me to occasionally work from home or come in late which meant i could give kat some help with the feeds and general parenting chaos however during the first year of being a parent i did feel i was missing out on a number of harrisons major milestones which was and still is upsetting it seemed bizarre to us that the system didnt account for dads wanting to take care of their kids and didnt fit with the way kat and i saw parenting at all i was therefore thrilled when nick clegg and the lib dems delivered spl under the coalition government it was clear he felt the old setup didnt fit modern life not only in terms of parental leave but also in terms of gender pay disparity and the high cost of childcare weirdly i ended up working in communications for nick in government both when spl finally came into effect thankfully now if we do decide to have another child we have a choice as to how we look after them,2016-04,law truly change society like govern parental leave probably changed slowly series

talk about baby steps on the first anniversary of the governments shared parental leave scheme figures show men have not leapt at the chance to have a chunk of time at home with their new baby according to the research by my family care and the womens business council the main obstacle was family finances this should not come as a surprise equality campaigners have long warned too few families can afford for fathers to take shared parental leave the governments own analysis estimated that only of fathers would take up the entitlement the financial reality for many families is that the father is still the main breadwinner the arrival of a new child and the extra financial strain is understandably seen as the worst time for them to take extended leave in other words the uks enduring gender pay gap is keeping old roles entrenched men go out to work women stay home as carers that is underscored by this new research which found half of men believe that taking shared parental leave is perceived negatively at work while of women say it would impact negatively on their partners career shared parental leave should in time help cut that gender pay gap something which david cameron has vowed to do in a generation that men currently feel unable to take the career risk or financial penalty of extended leave shows they also stand to gain from greater equality sadly recent history shows progress is painfully slow the equal pay act was passed more than four decades ago and the latest official figures still put the gender pay gap at more than ppi savings account with interest missold payment protection insurance policies have turned out to be a lucrative form of savings account banks are obliged to pay interest on the money they are returning to hapless customers they are not only getting back their premiums but a sizeable chunk on top it is worth thinking about what this means for the banking sector the latest reporting season provided a new wave of provisions for ppi refunds with lloyds alone adding a further bn to the pot the figures are mindboggling calculations by which show that the total amount set aside by the big five banks alone is bn since bn has been handed over seemingly a fair chunk of the bn paid in premiums between and however once the interest payments are factored in there appears to be scope for further payouts according to the professional financial claims association pfca only about half the bn represents refunded payments the rest is interest the pfca chairman nick baxter suggests that on a conservative estimate about threequarters of policies were missold not all of those sales would warrant a full refund in some cases a policyholder may have been flogged an expensive single premium policy when they would have willingly bought one that they paid for every month but by some measures there could be a further bn worth of premiums to repay plus interest clearly the pfca has an axe to grind it represents claims management companies and is lobbying against the financial conduct authoritys proposed deadline for customers who want to complain this time bar is also causing controversy with consumer bodies and baxter argues the banks can hardly claim to be nearly there in tackling the scandal if half of what they have paid out is in fact interest and not just the return of premiums the political and regulatory mood is clearly for the time bar to proceed the sale of ppi was lucrative for the industry while the prolonged period over which compensation is being repaid is a drag on the sector but the implementation of any time limit on claims needs to be carefully thought through executive pays longterm flaw whod have thought that selling kitchen cleaners condoms and throat soothers could be so

fathers are not taking advantage of rules that allow them to share leave with their partners according to research published a year after the rights came into force shared parental leave spl was introduced on april to give parents more choice and flexibility in caring for their children during the first months after their birth parents can split weeks leave receiving some payment for of those weeks that is on top of the two weeks statutory paternity leave available to fathers research among employers by the firm my family care found that more than four out of had not seen a single male employee take up the right at only between and of male workers had taken shared parental leave and fewer than reported more than takeup a further quarter of firms were not able to give a figure with statutory pay set at a maximum of a week of employees surveyed said a decision to share leave would depend on finances and whether their employer paid more than obliged to the research found that concerns over career progression were a factor for many with half of men saying they thought taking leave was perceived negatively at work and of mothers questioned said they did not want to share their leave only of individuals said shared parental leave was encouraged by their employer although almost half of businesses said they offered enhanced pay in line with what they offered employees taking maternity leave al ferguson founder of website the dad network said the figures showed there was still a stigma attached to a fathers role in parenting many working dads still feel its their duty to go out and earn the money despite having this option to stay at home with their new baby he said adding that he expected the takeup to increase although there are many hurdles that need to be overcome first spl is a slow step forward a government assessment suggested working fathers would be eligible to take the leave but only to would do so this compares with about nine in fathers in sweden and norway where between and of their earnings are replaced while they are on leave the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said shared parental leave had been a welcome small step towards getting dads more involved with childcare however she added takeup has been very low and tuc research shows as many as two in five new fathers are ineligible for shared parental leave as their partners are not in paid work or they fail to meet the qualifying conditions if the government is serious about men playing a more active role after their child is born they must increase statutory pay and give all new dads a right to some independent parental leave that is not shared with their partners the department for business innovation and skills said shared parental leave is provided to help mothers who want to return to work early share responsibility for the care of her child with the father or partner there are many factors that affect a couples decision on how childcare should be managed and by whom takeup is likely to be higher in organisations that offer pay above the statutory minimum we will evaluate the policy by the headline on this article was amended on april an

i am the father of a fiveyearold girl and for the past few years have been divorced from her mother my exwife and i have a good relationship with regard to how best to parent our daughter additionally we have a mutually agreeable system regarding when our daughter spends time with her mother and when she spends time with me the result is that our daughter spends alternate weekends with me and additionally she is with me one night a week my problem is that my exwife often likes to go out on friday or saturday nights drinking excessively into the wee hours she does this regularly at weekends when it is her weekend with our daughter on these occasions she arranges for our child to be looked after by her grandparents who live some considerable distance away i appreciate that because she is with our daughter more often than i am she does not have a lot of time available in which to socialise i always ensure my exwife knows that i am happy to have our daughter if there is a social event she would like to go to however she rarely accepts this offer i think it is important for both of us to have healthy social lives and we both do but i think it is important to arrange big nights out for when our daughter is with the other parent my daughter is a lovely happy and contented child and has adjusted to the separate living arrangements with no problem however i feel very strongly that going out until am and drinking heavily while ones daughter is being looked after by her grandparents and then not seeing your child again until the following afternoon is not good parenting how do i explain my feelings to my exwife is it any of my business you and your wife have successfully navigated a separation and divorce and established good coparenting arrangements thats excellent and not many manage it well done you ask if it is any of your business and the welfare of your daughter absolutely is it should be the priority for both of you but if this isnt compromised then the behaviour of your former wife and what she does with her time is not your definition of good parenting may be different although i note you have a pretty good timesplit with your daughter your exwife has her the majority of the time it is fair to say that many social engagements tend to take place on fridays and saturdays and your wife may not have control over when they are because other people may arrange them your ex may feel she needs to go out to keep herself sane or whole or she may feel it will help her meet someone else or make friends how much anyway do you really know about the facts i wonder here is what she is not doing she is not getting so drunk that she cant look after your daughter every day or at all as she has her parents look after your daughter when she goes out she is not leaving her with people you dont know or trust it sounds as if this happens once a fortnight at most you make the point of saying friday or saturday when she has her not both and it sounds as if she goes to quite a lot of trouble to leave your daughter with trusted grandparents who will presumably love having her there and with whom she will love being i would say this is pretty responsible behaviour unless there is something you are not telling me i wonder what is really concerning you is it that you are not spending enough time with your daughter is it that your ex goes out more than you is it that she drinks too much in your opinion is it that you feel left out of her life is it that her life no longer concerns you beyond where the venn diagram of your daughters care crosses over with yours or is it that you think this isnt how a mother should behave if you think about what is really concerning you perhaps you could then do something about it if it is in your remit to it is not that i dont think it is laudable that you are concerned about your daughter but i would be cautious of saying anything that sounds judgmental or censorious for the sake of it because it sounds as if the arrangement you have is really good and that your daughter is happy that doesnt mean you couldnt ever say anything if circumstances were to change but you dont voice any concerns at all that you feel your daughter is being neglected or abused in any way if you did my advice would be vastly different incidentally are the grandparents your exinlaws close to you still have they voiced any

jammaking by members of the womens institute is normally seen as a fun and essentially benign activity not a way of killing nazis the hay festival heard that during the second world war wi branches vigorously debated the consequences of a german invasion and jam was central they got very worked up about their jam said the academic maggie andrews author of a revised history of the wi called the acceptable face of feminism there are lovely descriptions and debates about what they would do if an invasion happens in about which didnt look unlikely one woman she said decided she would smash her jars of jam and deliberately kept a hammer nearby because starved germans would kill themselves by trying to eat jam with glass in it another wrote that it was good for the spirit as well as having obvious practical benefits cecily mccall wrote jammaking was constructive and nonmilitant for the belligerent what could be more satisfying than fiercely stirring cauldrons of boiling jam and feeling that every pound was one step closer to defeating hitler more seriously the wi successfully campaigned for equal compensation for war injuries correcting rules that said a mans leg for example was worth more than a womans they also got heavily involved in postwar housing demanding that female architects were used and workingclass women were included on housing committees andrews was arguing that the wi has always had a strong political and campaigning side to it it is not all jam and jerusalem and never has been describing the wi as the acceptable face of feminism andrews said its origins were heavily intertwined with the womens suffrage movement even in the early days the wi debated important issues and its members were as likely to be listening to a talk on bolshevism as they were sightseeing in italy different institutes have different views however a situation that still exists today andrews gave the example of the subject of venereal disease an important topic in the s which the leadership said should be discussed a branch in west sussex decided there was no need while a branch in cambridgeshire near military bases decided they must and needed to invite the whole local community andrews a professor of cultural history sympathised with one questioner who had avoided joining her institute because she found it too conservative and conservative she said that had always been the case because it was a federal organisation in the early days there were even some institutes where the members sat in rows according to their social class somewhat controversially she

im the older sister growing up neither my brother nor i had a great childhood because of the domestic abuse child abuse and anger issues in the family it was quite difficult and has affected me as an adult since attending therapy i realise that i want to reconnect with my brother i have resented him because my mother used favouritism as a part of the abuse she still does treat him preferentially to me but i want to move past this and try to have a normal relationship were in our s and neither of us is very friendly with the other we never talk or even call or visit as far as hes concerned he doesnt have a sister im just someone who lives up north i struggled with seeing him too because the last time he did visit before we stopped talking he was so rude and dismissive of my expartner that we ended up having a fight i think the way he acts is because my mother was much less critical of his behaviour and more patient with him he got away with it part of this is because he might have undiagnosed aspergers yet i often felt when my mum would physically punish me rather than him that this was an excuse my mother used to hurt me more over a year in which i have tried to make an effort such as buying tickets for events or organising a meal or trip he always turns me down or stops replying he says things like he doesnt want to go and purposefully hurtful things such as he has better things to do i understand there is hate on his part as well for what happened when i couldnt protect him but im starting to get tired of trying and wasting money when he cancels youve had a lot to deal with some people dont look back and realise whats happened in their family till much later and yet here you are in your s already incredibly selfawareand you have sought therapy which is fantastic there are also organisations such as napac napacorguk that provide helplines and local support groups should you find that useful i contacted nicola mccarry a psychotherapist aftorguk who deals with families in situations such as yours i asked what it might have been like growing up in such a household and she says that you and your brother may have felt it was your fault the abuse and general situation as children and felt responsible or to blame you werent of course but children tend to internalise and think everything is their fault i think this blame may have stayed with you both into adulthood i wondered about your line some hate on his part when i couldnt protect him because it sounds as if you did protect him sometimes explains mccarry the older child may try and draw some of the fire away from the younger i wondered if your brother felt he hadnt protected you also being the favourite isnt always a hallowed place to be the favoured child can often see the injustice but is powerless to do anything about it your brother also had to see you being physically punished which would have been fairly traumatising for him not to mention how traumatising it was and still is for you growing up in such a household would as mccarry explains have affected your sense of security your secure base was threatened to thrive we need to feel safe safe to go out and explore with the confidence that security gives us and then be able to return home and say if something bad happened you didnt have that i wondered how you would feel if you knew somehow that your brother was hurt and wanted to reconnect but yet still acted the way he did however you can only do so much you could contact him an email or a letter suggests mccarry and say something like i would love to have an adult relationship with you crucially away from your mother these are the things i regret if there is anything are there things about me you want to discuss however you can only do this up to a point because otherwise you are perpetuating the abusive family relationship in other words you cant keep knocking at his door if he is vile to you you can offer him a grownup loving sibling relationship but you cant make it happen you do make yourself vulnerable by doing this says mccarry but you need to release that power which he seems to have and actually in making yourself vulnerable thats a very strong thing to do remember she continues if you were to decide that there isnt a future with him some people make a family of choice with people who arent blood kin im really sorry you had such a difficult start to life but you do sound as if you are on the road to making a life thats worthy of you now if your brother chooses to join you thats up to him your problems solved contact annalisa

rarely have women in india come out on the streets en masse in such singular solidarity or desperation as they did ahead of last weeks elections in the southern state of tamil nadu the reason they urgently want politicians to ban the sale of alcohol which they blame for a huge rise in domestic violence and rape cases in the region although there are no figures to back this up i have listened to woman after woman in different indian villages and slums tell me how alcohol has brought misery into their homes in recent years adding domestic violence and abject poverty to already difficult lives i have even heard horror stories of fathers raping their own daughters while at their drunken worst apparently everyone knows this kind of thing is happening but no one talks about it the social worker who told me this said how can any woman talk about it the father of her children will be jailed the family will be finished off the girls will never be married this is india after all i first witnessed the utter devastation caused by alcohol years ago when i moved from urban indian society to encounter rural maternal mortality and malnutrition at close quarters i often shared a meal with a young pregnant woman her doting husband cooked the food fetched firewood washed the clothes and dishes during her morning sickness months this is not the norm for indian men four months into her pregnancy i heard shed lost her baby shocked i asked how apparently her husband came home drunk on saturday night beat her up violently and kicked her in the stomach until she fell down bleeding worse this was the third baby she had lost due to her husbands drunken abuse six indian states have already banned or partially banned the sale of alcohol including neighbouring kerala and gujarat and bihar last year an alcohol ban was upheld in kerala and the keralan social justice minister mk muneer attributed of domestic violence cases to alcohol and substance abuse in families it is still too early to gauge the impact of the partial prohibition in kerala but womens groups claim that domestic violence and crimes against women have decreased since the first tentative steps were taken to ban booze in august last year in the northern state of bihar the chief minister nitish kumars claims of huge drop in domestic violence and rape since an alcohol ban was introduced in april are backed by police statistics between april and april the number of crimes against women dropped by from to and the number of rape cases fell by from to every political party in tamil nadu sensed the mood and jumped on the antialcohol bandwagon in the runup to the elections even the ruling party the all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam aiadmk led by jayalalithaa known nationally as amma or mother an astute politician had committed to prohibition ironic really since her party created a state monopoly for the sale of alcohol through special governmentowned and leased alcohol shops raking in bn rupees bn last year according to government statistics about million people of a population of million consume alcohol every day in tamil nadu most of them are poor the womens ire is targeted at the government and its off licences dotted around the beleaguered countryside the local vendors even provide the men with a free delivery service right up to their doorstep the drinkers get alcohol on credit too so on payday they hand over most of their meagre wages to the liquor shop prohibitionists argue that alcohol has never been an integral part of indian culture while brewed alcohol was a tradition especially among indias indigenous people distilled alcohol was introduced during the colonial period and indians took to it without any of the associated western social and cultural rituals as one antialcohol campaigner says our upwardly mobile globetrotting young indians proclaim it is all about drinking responsibly how do i explain responsibly to a woman who has been beaten black and blue by her drunken husband maybe these youngsters have developed a culture of social drinking but look at the men in our villages and in poorer areas they buy a quarter ml of hard liquor and down it right there in the shop then stagger home if they are lucky or just collapse by the roadside she argues for the wives and daughters of such men only prohibition will do it has become a very polarised debate on one side you have a powerful alcohol industry and the more elite urbanites dismissing the concept of prohibition they are backed by bureaucrats arguing that the government cannot manage to finance welfare schemes without the income generated through alcohol sales on the other are the poor often rural women who bear the physical and psychological scars inflicted on them by their drunken husbands fathers brothers and sons and their only weapon is their vote tamil nadu voted jayalalithaa back to power she has promised to implement prohibition in a phased manner the big question was whether she will sacrifice nearly of the states income to protect women and children her immediate reply was to order the shutdown of governmentrun liquor shops on day one the women of tamil nadu are cheering their votes have set the agenda,2016-05,rarely woman india come street en masse singular solidarity desperation ahead last week election southern state tamil nadu reason urgently want politician ban

when monica demeterova completed her early years childminding course last december local parents were swift to sign up to her services and she looked forward to launching her own business five months on she is scraping a living doing agency work at a warehouse while the children on her books have found provision elsewhere the reason is that she has been waiting days for the disclosure and barring service dbs certificate required by law for anyone working with children and vulnerable adults the dbs which replaced the criminal record bureau in checks the background and suitability of individuals as a former nanny and nursery employee yearold demeterova already has the necessary paperwork but since she will be running her business from her home her husband michal also needs to be assessed and his application submitted last december is one of tens of thousands stuck in a bureaucratic logjam financially its ruining my familys life she says its always been my dream to run my own business and last year wed saved enough for a deposit on a house to run it from and i was approved for a government startup loan which i hoped would cover my training ive now lost that money because you must have started your business within six months of the loan being agreed demeterova is one of thousands of wouldbe workers unable to take up a new job because of the dbs backlog which reached an unprecedented peak this spring the nhs and schools are among those who are prevented from hiring staff because of the weeks of waiting for the required disclosures and this month a former home office junior minister described as scandalous the news that childminders are unable to run their businesses because of the delays meg hillier labour mp for hackney south and shoreditch has raised the issue with the home office and blames a basic lack of police resources for the problem the lengthy wait for the certificate is undermining the governments commitment to double the provision of free childcare according to the professional association for childcare and early years primarily dbs delays prevent a childminder from operating and at worst it could potentially delay the growth of the sector says chief executive liz bayram demeretova says her neighbour was the first to sign up for her services because his childrens school had closed its afterschool club because of the delays in dbs checks they didnt have enough qualified staff or volunteers to continue it she says the majority of dbs applications are stuck with police forces who examine the records of those seeking to work in a range of sectors among them education healthcare social services and private hire transport seventeen out of forces are missing the government target of completing of applications within days according to home office data nearly half the checks lodged with the worst performing forces dorset and londons metropolitan police are still ongoing after days leaving an estimated jobseekers in limbo anyone calling the dbs helpline to check progress is now informed by an automated message that they can expect to wait up to weeks for their application to clear when more than one police force is involved in a check the delays can be even longer the met which handles of applications nationally and which is struggling to clear a backlog of cases blames a sharp increase in applications over the past two years and difficulty in recruiting and retaining the staff required to process them it has hired extra staff and temporarily moved nonfrontline or retired officers to assist it is anticipated that we are at the peak of the backlog of outstanding cases but we cant take any short cuts says a spokesperson for the force its not simple administrative work staff are making decisions about the disclosure of information that may involve a number of different police forces and because these decisions directly impact children and vulnerable adults staff require significant specialist training and supervision applicants are only entitled to lodge a complaint if they have waited more than days and even then the dbs warns their case may not be escalated because of the congested system it admits that in march this year applications lodged with the met had been in progress for longer than days moreover if the police have to send an application back to the dbs with a query the clock returns to zero and the days start again many of those waiting are forced to live off state benefits or personal savings in the interim adam wilkins of birmingham had a job offer as a coach driver withdrawn after his enhanced dbs check was still ongoing after days within a month he secured a contract as a hospital phlebotomist but a new dbs application had to be submitted and days on is still parked with the met wilkins who had applied for both jobs after being made redundant has been forced to live on aweek jobseekers allowance since december because of the bureaucracy that prevents him drawing his a week hospital salary ive worked all my life and i dont want to be on benefits he says when the observer raises his plight with the met a senior manager is assigned to his case and within four days his original december application is completed as it covers working with children the certificate is valid for his healthcare job the dbs says that although it has a service level agreement with police forces to complete of checks within days it is powerless to speed up the process we are reliant on the police to carry out their checks within agreed timescales failure to do so impacts on our ability to achieve our targets says a spokesperson for the dbs which processes m checks a year the delay in processing dbs checks by the metropolitan police is of great concern to us and our customers they have informed us that their recovery plan includes recruiting training and transferring additional staff and we are monitoring this situation closely the problem is also affecting service providers who are already struggling to recruit staff care homes report that they are having to rely on expensive agency workers while they await dbs checks for new recruits and many are suffering from financial loss as a result according to the care home association meanwhile many teachers applications submitted last june were not ready before the school year began in september one primary school in north london said that of its staff are unable to fulfil their roles because of the delays under official guidelines you can do a risk assessment based on the dbs from someones previous job but they have to be supervised at all times says the headteacher who asked to remain anonymous in one case we had to wait four months for a check to come through theres already a teacher shortage in london so this is a headache we could do without the royal college of nursing also says the issue is having an impact on the nhs at a time when there is a shortage of nurses it is causing severe disruptions for individuals and great concern to us says roz hooper principal legal officer recently our advice line has taken a call from someone who had her job offer withdrawn because her disclosure hadnt come through in time and someone else who has had to delay her university course and possibly lose her bursary and her place demeterova meanwhile estimates that the delays have so far cost her up to she cant find a stopgap job that pays enough to fund childcare for her two young children or with hours to fit in with her husbands shift work instead of earning a week caring for the eight children who had signed up for her services she is reliant on whatever warehouse shifts are available on a good week that earns her but for times when cover is not required she receives nothing my husbands salary goes on the mortgage and bills and mine was to be used for living expenses she says we had planned to buy a new car and go on a holiday but now im just happy if i can afford to do the weekly shop when i call for an update no one can give me any information sometimes i feel theres no point going on i have hit rock bottom how the service works the disclosure and barring service dbs replaced the criminal records bureau crb which was established after the murder of schoolgirls holly wells and jessica chapman anyone working with vulnerable people had to be checked for a criminal record and figures revealed the checks had prevented more than unsuitable people including rapists and paedophiles from working with atrisk groups but the crb was beset by long waiting times and cumbersome bureaucracy and in december the coalition government replaced it under the protection of freedoms act the dbs was supposed to speed up the process by introducing an update service which for an annual fee enables people to reuse their certificate when applying for similar jobs subject to an instant online check by their employer this confirms if the certificate is up to date whereas the old crb had to be started from scratch each time an update was required the new system also exempts unders from checks however the dbs requires other rigorous checks which might involve more than one police force depending on where the applicant has lived and worked there are three types of check a standard check required for example for court prison or security officers an enhanced check for anyone working with children or in social or healthcare services and an enhanced check with barred list check for adoptive parents or taxi drivers while companies can employ those whose checks have not been completed its at their own risk and the individuals in question have to be supervised at all times,2016-05,monica demeterova completed early year childminding course last december local

my mother is charming bright and often very lovely shes also a neurotic mix of guilttripper tantrum thrower and hypochondriac our family revolves around her moods and sicknesses her hypochondriac behaviour is escalating it has always been an issue my siblings and i had several operations each before we left home some of which she now tells me she knew were unnecessary i know why she struggles and why she involves us she was emotionally and sometimes physically neglected as a child growing up in the middle of a large family constantly ignored i get that shes stuck as that child her tantrums make it clear that shes less emotionally mature than my sevenyearold daughter im not particularly nice or patient i resent having to be the adult to be the bigger person my father always colluded with her and never challenged her behaviour shes terrified of growing old to the point where my family and i remained in the uk when we were looking to emigrate as my older sister has with her family i have agreed that ill be there for my mum and my dad as they get older shes terrified at the idea of going into a home so ive promised ill be there i hate to admit it but i dont do all of this out of love i do it because unlike my siblings i cant bear the guilt trips my mother has always criticised me for being too soft and i think shes probably right i know she wont change and that she needs my support but no matter how much i remind myself that this is not her fault and that she didnt choose to be this miserable i keep getting so angry with her for all of it i cant see the point in challenging behaviour that wont change but im so damn frustrated with trying to deal with her its constantly draining if i try to distance myself to recharge my batteries she escalates and has a health crisis which will snowball for days if i try to pay her more attention to give her what she needs shell manufacture an argument and throw a tantrum its like having a toddler who is never going to grow out of it so i suppose im asking for a coping mechanism a mantra i can repeat internally to bolster my patience hang on if the way your mother behaves isnt her fault whose is it she needs to take responsibility for her behaviour you can love someone but hate what they do it doesnt make you bad i think you sound immensely kind and patient but way too understanding and unless you change the only bit you can the way you respond things are just going to carry on as they are i contacted psychoanalyst and visiting professor at university college london rosine perelberg psychoanalyticcouncilorg she says that hypochondria is really about control generally in hypochondria there is a double presentation the desire to control both ones own bodymortality and those around them its a form of slavery and indeed you are enslaved to her behaviour arent you she says there are two aspects to hypochondria a terror of death but also paradoxically a destruction of life the key thing perelberg says is that you need to deeply believe that youre not helping the way your mother is by reacting the way you do i think you need to really concentrate on this phrase what youre doing the way you are responding to her isnt helping your mother and it really isnt helping you so why continue perelberg also thinks that you hit the nail on the head when you described your mother as being like a child and as with a toddler you need to create structures for when things happen she thinks it is interesting that your brother only responds at certain times and that your sister had taken herself out of the situation entirely she also notes that you dont ask for a way out you want to bolster your patience not to be free but to continue sometimes when destructive family patterns affect us we tolerate them but when they start to affect the next generation in this case your daughter as you hinted at in your longer letter you seem to be thinking enough is enough now thats good because you need to break this pattern but how perelberg suggests you might be less interested in your mothers symptoms give them minimal acknowledgement you could also choose to make yourself unavailable to her at certain times this isnt going to be easy and wont happen overnight but when she talks about her illnesses zone out shell have her health crises let her she has them anyway doesnt she hand the responsibility for her life back to your mother because nothing you say or do is going to make her less ill happier or less dysfunctional you simply dont have that power its futile so stop trying it doesnt mean that you have to stop being a loving daughter or be cruel or cut your mother out of your life your behaviour towards her even at its worst sounds far more loving than hers

childrens charities said the focus on life chances in the queens speech would prove meaningless without a concerted parallel attempt to tackle child poverty which is expected to soar in the next four years as cuts to benefits hit home they voiced concern that the new life chances strategy due to be published later this year would place much less emphasis on low family income as a measure of deprivation looking instead at less easily defined factors including educational attainment family breakdown addiction and debt antipoverty charities welcomed the governments commitment to an allout assault on the root causes of poverty but warned that the recent dismantling of the child poverty act which had been passed with crossparty support weeks before the general election as part of the welfare reform and work act earlier this year scrapped targets for the eradication of child poverty the revised legislation introduced new poverty indicators including educational attainment and worklessness but charities stressed that the most direct cause of poverty is having a low income often from being in a badlypaid job as opposed to being unemployed rather than being linked to family instability or addiction matthew reed the chief executive of the childrens society said the rhetoric around life chances would mean little without a drive to address child poverty which the institute for fiscal studies predicts will rise by to million children living in relative poverty by reducing the number of families struggling with debt and surviving on low incomes must be at the centre of any new strategy the best way of improving childrens chances of having a decent start in life is to make sure they are not growing up in cold homes or without hot meals he said a more powerful strategy to improve the life chances of the most disadvantaged children would involve scrapping the fouryear freeze on childrens benefits and cuts to support for working families in universal credit he added the childrens society would continue to make the case that low incomes needs to be at the very heart of a life chances strategy for children the queens speech on wednesday announced that to tackle poverty and the causes of deprivation including family instability addiction and debt my government will introduce new indicators for measuring life chances in a background briefing on the policy published after the speech there was a commitment to publishing a strategy that would set out our comprehensive plan for transforming the life chances of disadvantaged children and their families and will include a set of life indicators for measuring them in a speech on life chances in january david cameron had hinted at the range of issues that might be included in a strategy describing a single mum on a povertystricken estate someone who suffers from chronic depression someone who perhaps drinks all day to numb the pain of the sexual abuse she suffered as a child he said when we know that so many of those in poverty have specific treatable problems such as alcoholism drug addiction poor mental health weve got to offer the right support including to those in crisis imran hussain the child poverty action groups director of policy said there is a disconnect between what the government is doing and saying you cant spread life chances when child poverty is expected to rise steeply he said there was very little evidence about poverty being caused by addictions or family breakdown we welcome the governments language around an allout assault on poverty and improving life chances for children we think to do that you have to have a wideranging approach but we dont think the government has got a broad approach at the moment it is looking to exclude income hussain said the chief executive of children imelda redmond said it is vital that the impact of low income is not forgotten while the commitment to a higher wage lower welfare economy is the right goal the facts remain that of the million children living in poverty almost twothirds are in working households low income can impact on a childs health their ability to learn and succeed in life with those numbers set to rise any meaningful strategy focused on improving the life chances of our children cannot overlook the scourge of low income anna feuchtwang the chief executive of the national childrens bureau said despite the prime ministers stated commitment to promoting all childrens life chances we are seeing swingeing cuts to the very services like childrens centres that can build a

even armed with a phd in developmental psychology i remember the frightening first moments after bringing my newborn daughter home from the hospital i wasnt sure what to do and not at all confident that i was capable of being the parent she needed me to be every little decision about feeding and caring for this helpless human seemed momentous and fraught with anxiety what if i dont make it a full year of breastfeeding should i turn off the tv whenever she is in the room to avoid passive screen exposure is it ok for her to enter fulltime day care at five months popular press accounts of parenting and child development research were not particularly helpful either even though as a scientist i knew better the way the research was translated for the public lacked nuance and easily penetrated my vulnerable state of mind i fretted that my daughters formula consumption would result in lower iq i worried that if i was too tired to read to her one evening before bed she would never learn to read and since shes started elementary school i have slipped numerous times and called her smart instead of more appropriately praising her effort as so many articles advise my personal experiences as a parent are in part why i study the experiences of other parents in my new parents project an ongoing longitudinal study of nearly dualearner couples who welcomed their first children in i have tried to measure this parenting perfectionism that is holding oneself to impossibly high standards for parenting and perhaps even more important believing that others hold you to impossibly high standards for parenting mothers even those in dualearner families not only bear the brunt of parenting responsibilities but also experience the strongest pressure to be perfect parents in the latter half of the th century at the same time mothers entered the workforce in greater numbers norms for mothering evolved toward an intensive mothering ideal this norm dictates that mothers parenting should be timeconsuming emotionally absorbing and guided by expert advice this pressure is particularly intense for middleclass mothers who may practice a childrearing style called concerted cultivation an approach identified by annette laureau in the early s this style focuses on deliberately providing children with experiences and activities that will help them develop their intellectual and social skills middleclass parents especially those toward the upper end of the socioeconomic spectrum have the human capital resources time and money to practice concerted cultivation and do so to ensure their childrens future success the quest to be a perfect mother may actually harm a mothers parenting in my labs research on new parents we found that mothers showed less confidence in their parenting abilities when they were more worried about what other people thought about their parenting the popularity of social media has probably exacerbated this phenomenon because parents can look at what other parents are doing even in ostensibly private moments and judge themselves in comparison in fact recent research has linked greater facebook use to feelings of depression due to the way individuals tend to compare themselves to others in my own research when we asked new parents about their facebook use mothers who were more frequent visitors to the site and who managed their accounts more frequently reported higher levels of parenting stress the irony is that in seeking perfection in parenting parents are less likely to actually parent effectively worrying about what others think of their parenting saps mothers confidence leading them to experience parenting as less enjoyable and more stressful when faced with inevitable parenting challenges mothers with lower confidence and more parenting stress give up more quickly there may be disagreement among child development experts about issues such as screen time or sleep routines but there is striking agreement about the key elements of good parenting even if consensus is less likely to make headlines than the latest parenting controversy good parenting has a lot more to do with the how than the what good parents are those who are sensitive to their childrens needs and in tune with their children such that they are able to adjust their parenting as children develop and desire greater independence children thrive when their parents are consistent warm hold high expectations for childrens behavior explain the reasons behind their rules and negotiate when appropriate greater stress about parenting further depletes parents psychological resources which may in turn affect their ability to adapt to the changing needs of their children and regulate their own emotions and behavior when parenting their children in other words when you lack confidence and feel chronically stressed about parenting it is hard to be sensitive warm and consistent you are more likely to yell when you intended to explain calmly to your toddler to stop banging her plate on the table for the millionth time you may find yourself mentally checked out when your baby looks at you and gurgles or when your tween wants to tell you all about the latest disney channel sitcom you may give in to your preschoolers endless demands for more pokmon cards so dont sweat the small stuff remember that the big picture is what is important be aware that what other mothers post on facebook may not represent the reality of their parenting experiences any more than it represents yours view the latest

one of the more common pieces of advice given to new dads is to learn by doing think too much as several comments to a recent guardian piece on fatherhood argued and you risk prejudicing the fatherchild relationship with ideology psychological projections or other cerebral mess its not terrible advice but it rests on a key assumption that parents emerge into their role the same way behavioural psychologists see their children tabula rasa but parents are not blank slates nor arguably are kids they inherit ideas techniques and philosophies of parenting well before any on the job training starts this is perhaps especially true for men despite marked improvements in recent decades many women are still socially primed for domesticity and encouraged to think about their futures as mothers whether they want to or not men on the other hand are rarely prompted to imagine the domestic aspects of their future identity this means mens primary training for fatherhood remains in the experience of being a son the only time when they experience the domestic life first hand there is a lack of both space and encouragement to reflect on their experience of being a son and to carefully imagine how they would like to father it can leave men removed from the parenting conversation struggling to imagine how a future life with children might look or how their role as a father might be different to their own dads in kids are worth it titled for some inexplicable reason in lower case barbara coloroso writes the tools that come first to hand as parents do not serve us well these tools were given to us often unintentionally and without malice by our parents grandparents siblings and extended family as well as by society colorosos thesis is that unless we understand the unconscious beliefs we have about parenting discipline and childhood we are likely to err into old possibly undesirable practices dan siegel a clinical psychiatrist and pioneer in the study of interpersonal neurobiology has devoted much of his research life to understanding how parenting behaviours are transmitted from one generation to another his findings show that two processes are key to making real changes in how we parent first we need to know about our own histories as children and second we need a clear understanding about how this experience has affected our ability to relate to other people its this development of a coherent narrative about our childhoods that determines our ability to really change the nature of our relationships with our children on a practical level this means fathers need an understanding of what it was like for them to be sons and how this has influenced their experience of close relationships as adults its not enough to say i wont be like my father if a man isnt aware of the ways in which he already is whats true for fathers is also true for mothers although given the social conditioning around women and motherhood its likely this reflection has taken place at a more conscious level for many women for men and even less so for queer or trans men there are no social cues to prompt them to contemplate impending fatherhood or their relationship or lack thereof with their own father this message can be reinforced as men prepare to become dads alongside their partners journey through pregnancy baby showers though increasingly mixed are still seen as a womans affair and because again the gender issue isnt onesided are often marked by hyperfeminine tropes as the mothertobe is showered with gifts to prepare for domestic life the father is nowhere to be seen is it any surprise the domestic world feels alien to many men some scientific studies have shown fatherhood triggers a decline in testosterone among men physiologically many dads are no longer wired for the masculinity that defined them preparenthood if this coincides with a narrative around male parenting still populated by career achievement toughness and selfsufficiency it seems like a recipe for alienation a domestic identity wellsuited to men but socially prohibited despite the fact that the home is precisely where dads children live this matters both violence and neglect lurk quietly under the surface of this discussion about fatherhood its most often at the hands of their fathers and stepfathers that children are sexually abused die or witness the death of their mothers and almost of australian children will lose contact with one parent following separation in most cases their father and all the while mothers are bearing the additional load of a social narrative shifting men away from domestic responsibility fathers are still so separated from the domestic realm that even their failures are not their own either in the silent background or the noisy foreground its mothers who are often blamed for poor fathering they are alienating over controlling financially demanding anxious or overinvolved this false positioning of mothers as all powerful not only contributes to the demonising of mothers but continues to both devalue fathers and to infantilise them as they are once again portrayed as too hopeless to address their own parenting in the face of the allpowerful mother perhaps even more seriously it masks a system that locks men into roles which see them separated from the lives of children almost from the moment they leave their own childhoods behind men transitioning into fatherhood are often encouraged to trust their instincts roll up their sleeves and not think too much but maybe what they really need is to look back at their own histories and more widely around them to the institutions and rituals that stifle their place in the home and their development from son to father,2016-05,one common piece advice given new dad

a poor vulnerable young woman in a major australian city suffers an epileptic fit and collapses to the ground unconscious incredibly shockingly while still unconscious she is raped and falls pregnant no one would deny her in these terrible circumstances the right to the very best health care a termination and continuing attention from the best medical specialists well we now know one person would malcolm turnbull the prime minister and minister for immigration peter dutton have tried to wash their hands of responsibility in a case with exactly these facts except for one small difference the rape did not take place in australia but on the failed state of nauru and the young woman known only as s is an african refugee who came by boat to australia in and now resides there awaiting resettlement what makes turnbulls haughty indifference toward the young woman so hard to take is that since he became prime minister he has been so keen to be seen as an advocate against domestic violence he had only been pm for ten days when he stood next to then australian of the year rosie batty and thundered we have to make it as though it was unaustralian to disrespect women we must become a country which is known for its respect for women and at a breakfast marking international womens day in march this year he basked in a medicilike glow announcing a million womens safety package and then said it is time to confront this very important fact societys attitude towards women the value we place on women the regard we have for women is directly connected to the violence that is committed against women so what then to make of the actions of the turnbull government in relation to s culminating in the matter being heard in the federal court in melbourne last week the facts of the rape were not disputed that this woman represented by the notforprofit law firm the national justice project founded by george newhouse and me needed an abortion was also not in contest however the medical evidence was that such a procedure could not be straightforward due to the significant risks because of her neurological and gynecological conditions in other words this was a complex case and she needed the very best medical care the government accepted that without its assistance the young woman could not get a termination they are simply not available on nauru the simplest quickest most costeffective solution and the one that would ensure the best medical outcome would have been to bring her to australia the law even allows this if there are exceptional circumstances surely thats a no brainer surely the circumstances must be exceptional in this case after all five separate medical experts including neurologists psychiatrists and general practitioners advised the government that because the procedure would carry extra complications and should be carried out in australia but the turnbull government the one that wants to make it unaustralian to disrespect women said no it flew her off without warning to port moresby where she has spent the last month the trouble is abortion is illegal in papua new guinea and the necessary standards of medical care to deal with a case like this just do not exist for the last four weeks we have been arguing that the government owed this young woman a duty of care to provide a safe and legal medical procedure and that this could not be done in png the court found in the young womans favour that must please all people like malcolm turnbull who value individual freedom in the face of a hamfisted and meanspirited bureaucracy and it must also please all people like malcolm turnbull who believe in equality and respect for women but on monday dutton gave yet another pantomime of toughness as predictable as it was banal to announce that he was weighing up an appeal against the judgment but the judge was clear all that needs to be done now is for the minister to sign a piece of paper stating the exceptional circumstances of the case and to bring her to australia or even another safe place and fulfil the governments legal obligations to her meanwhile the young woman waits anxiously and enters her second trimester two weeks ago the pm warned about being mistyeyed about australias immigration policy but medical specialists deal in facts lawyers and judges work with the living working reality of rules on government responsibility and human rights stretching back over years to the magna carta it is in fact the government that is being emotional and capricious the young woman still sits under guard in port moresby all we ask is that she urgently receives a safe and lawful termination after her shocking rape malcolm turnbull must be on her side mustnt he,2016-05,poor

victoria by his father greg anderson in what a coroner found was a premeditated act of filicide the family law system needs urgent change to keep children and their parents safe the petition says the current system allows too many children to be placed in the hands of an abusive parent as the system struggles to identify and respond to the risk factors in family violence cases it allows for too many mothers who have taken the difficult and dangerous step to leave abusive partners to be retraumatised at a time when they are at their most vulnerable the system is overburdened underfunded and must change batty told reporters that she had highlighted clear steps that could be taken to make the journey through the family law system safer for women and especially children now i am asking you

what proportion of british board members are women the figures are disappointing at ftse companies and at ftse firms which is why a target has been set for ftse firms to have female board members by but whats it like for those who have made it in already we hear confessions from women both in the public and private sector people commented on my looks not my capabilities i was the only woman of men on the board of a large it services company and was on the receiving end of a lot of sexist bias some conscious but a lot of it unconscious for example i experienced inappropriate comments and unsolicited advances from my mainly married peers at board level women at all levels experience this however i was quite young when i joined this board and many also felt that it was ok to comment on my looks rather than my capabilities this led me to changing my image to discourage any attention i wore no makeup and screwed my hair back i got the position through hard work and building up a good reputation i had been referred to the chief executive by a senior woman in my previous company so my looks should never have come into it i am not sure men are aware that mentioning how women look makes many of us feel uncomfortable i really think that they must believe we feel complimented in some way but instead it makes a lot of women believe that they dont want to be in that boys club and so they are turned off from applying for those positions they may think that they simply dont belong in that environment or are intimidated by it despite this it has been my privilege to be the only woman the group marketing director on the board of a bn company told by several female employees that they saw me as a role model that was what really made it for me that i might have inspired at least one other woman to try one of the big issues certainly in the technology sector is the unconscious bias of a profile of white male executives in their s doing the hiring to boards for example just today one of the women that i coach in a large tech company said all the managers here are white middleaged men when a woman leaves she is replaced by a man whether this is true or not that is her perception this is a young universityeducated something who is looking desperately for role models so the key challenge is who is there for her to look up to and whose footsteps does she follow in former female board member of large uk firm the uk is much better than elsewhere in the world on the face of it you would expect the board i sit on of a publicprivate initiative in the north to be horribly sexist its shareholders include a council a university and a telecommunications services company however i have never felt that any dialogue debate or attitude has been influenced by my gender in fact i have experienced less sexism while sitting on boards than i have when pitching for or delivering work i have also sat on boards abroad and have seen horrendous sexism and racism elsewhere in the world im actually very proud of the uk and our inclusive society while the situation is improving however i believe quotas would be a mistake women want to feel that they have got something because of their own merit and being seen as a quota hire will undoubtedly at some point incentivise a discriminatory comment such as youre only here because we had to have a woman in order to be taken seriously we as women cannot be seen as the victim or a group that needs special attention we have to prove our worth and stand on our own two feet any purposeful and harmful discrimination needs to be dealt with professionally within the boundaries of the law and governance a consultant specialising in technology startups women need to have more role models my board roles are in the publicthird sector and on both boards there is a high percentage of women as a result perhaps i have not been aware of any overt discrimination or sexism i suspect that private sector experiences would be very different however i am sure that there is a level of unconscious sexism and i have no way of knowing if i failed to get other roles because of my gender interestingly i experienced active discrimination at a previous role where womens efforts to progress to board level were actively blocked and mens encouraged there are definitely more challenges for women trying to get on a board including a lack of effective role models throughout the career process i meet many women who have never thought that a board position could be a possibility so have not thought about how to structure their career to attain it women also seem to be worse at career planning than men we also face bias conscious or unconscious in staff development and recruitment theres a wellknown factor that groups will recruit new group members that they feel comfortable with this generally means people like them so a predominantly white male board will usually prefer white male candidates plus recruitment methods are often unconsciously biased by the experience of the recruiter when i started my career women were steered towards softer subjects and softer careers which typically are not represented at board level now my cohort and i are reaching the level of seniority to consider board positions those career choices may hinder advancement to the next level because there isnt the perceived need for those softer skills at board level so the pool of suitable candidates has far more men than women technology director at a public sector organisation theres a real old boys network in the private sector the disparity between how women are treated in the public and private sector is massive i have worked in a ftse company and also for a public sector organisation in an education role the private sector follows a law unto itself and women are seen much less on board and senior executive roles however moving into the public sector its been much more diverse thats particularly relevant to the sector i work in in the business sector for women who dont have kids maybe there is less of a difference but the moment you have a child everything changes at the ftse company meetings were always held in the evenings making it hard if you had a caring responsibility i now work in a senior role in the education sector and its my responsibility to recruit board members as a mother with three children i am careful to make sure that my meetings are flexible looking at the best time to try to be familyfriendly i have also seen an old boys network culture in the private sector where men on boards go to things such as the rugby or out drinking excluding women even if youre working at the same level i cannot say ive experienced any overt discrimination myself but i think there is a real reluctance for the private sector to embrace gender diversity in the same way as the public sector weve seen improvements on boards in the public sector for example in education the nhs and police but the private business world is very slow on the uptake governance role,2016-05,proportion british board member woman figure disappointing ftse company ftse firm target ha set ftse

a year after rules came into force that allow fathers to share parental leave with their partners hardly any are according to a survey of employers and parents only of dads are taking advantage of this new opportunity more than four out of companies had not seen a single male employee take up the right why well there are the obvious reasons men worrying about their jobs or not being interested equal pay and so on separations and divorces will also make this whole privilege a complicated matter i can imagine a good oneact play based on difficulties caused by the fact that whereas it is always clear who is the mother of a baby it is not always so certain who the father is witness the old saying few men can be certain they are not fathers and they are not necessarily to be envied the firms that allow parental leave might endeavour to find out how much time the parent actually does spend with their offspring as opposed to on a holiday to help them recover from the strain of it all while granny copes with the child or even doing extra work elsewhere to pay for a nanny is a daddy more likely to do this than a mummy in sweden where shared parental leave is offered on a use it or lose it basis it has been nicknamed moose hunting leave yet another reason being given for the low takeup is the unwillingness of many mothers to share this time with their baby the interesting thing is that for the most part equality between the sexes has until now been a matter of females getting a slice of the privileges enjoyed by men not the other way round shared parental leave may be a sign that all that is about to change what do you think have your say below,2016-05,year rule came force allow father share parental leave partner hardly according survey employer parent dad taking advantage new opportunity four company seen single male employee take right well obvious reason men worrying job interested equal pay separation divorce also make whole privilege complicated matter imagine good oneact play based difficulty caused fact whereas always clear mother baby always certain father witness old saying men certain father necessarily envied firm allow parental leave might endeavour find much time parent actually doe spend offspring opposed holiday help recover strain granny cope child even extra work elsewhere pay nanny daddy likely mummy sweden shared parental leave offered use lose basis ha nicknamed moose hunting leave yet another reason given low takeup unwillingness many mother share time baby interesting thing part equality sex ha matter female getting slice privilege enjoyed men way round shared parental leave may sign change think say,"['year', 'rule', 'came', 'force', 'allow', 'father', 'share', 'parental', 'leave', 'partner', 'hardly', 'according', 'survey', 'employer', 'parent', 'dad', 'taking', 'advantage', 'new', 'opportunity', 'four', 'company', 'seen', 'single', 'male', 'employee', 'take', 'right', 'well', 'obvious', 'reason', 'men', 'worrying', 'job', 'interested', 'equal', 'pay', 'separation', 'divorce', 'also', 'make', 'whole', 'privilege', 'complicated', 'matter', 'imagine', 'good', 'oneact', 'play', 'based', 'difficulty', 'caused', 'fact', 'whereas', 'always', 'clear', 'mother', 'baby', 'always', 'certain', 'father', 'witness', 'old', 'saying', 'men', 'certain', 'father', 'necessarily', 'envied', 'firm', 'allow', 'parental', 'leave', 'might', 'endeavour', 'find', 'much', 'time', 'parent', 'actually', 'doe', 'spend', 'offspring', 'opposed', 'holiday', 'help', 'recover', 'strain', 'granny', 'cope', 'child', 'even', 'extra', 'work', 'elsewhere', 'pay', 'nanny', 'daddy', 'likely', 'mummy', 'sweden', 'shared', 'parental', 'leave', 'offered', 'use', 'lose', 'basis', 'ha', 'nicknamed', 'moose', 'hunting', 'leave', 'yet', 'another', 'reason', 'given', 'low', 'takeup', 'unwillingness', 'many', 'mother', 'share', 'time', 'baby', 'interesting', 'thing', 'part', 'equality', 'sex', 'ha', 'matter', 'female', 'getting', 'slice', 'privilege', 'enjoyed', 'men', 'way', 'round', 'shared', 'parental', 'leave', 'may', 'sign', 'change', 'think', 'say']",159
one of the more personal effects of the brexit vote is the damage it has done to relationships between remain and leave voters with so many of the older generation voting to exit and their children voting to remain there will be rifts in many families that need to be mended for my own part im fed up with the result yes because i wanted it to go the other way but more than that as a therapist im fed up with how we have failed to communicate if we want to heal the wound weve opened up its no use continuing with the same toxic debate it is no use just throwing facts at each other because we will always choose the facts that fit our feelings in order to do better in future we must stop pretending to be so rational we must acknowledge and understand our feelings and acknowledge and understand those who feel differently instead of dismissing them if we want to avoid sinking into mutual resentment what is urgently required now is wisdom from both camps leave and remain wise parents know that when their oldest child says of their younger sibling that they wish that they had never been born and they want them to go back to the hospital now it is pointless to admonish them for having the wrong feelings feelings are not right or wrong they just are to say that the child is bad for having and voicing such feelings will not make the feelings go away on the contrary they will fester and find more devious ways to get heard the child will start to play up and hate and bully their younger sibling so when such feelings are voiced a wise parent is kind about them they get down to the childs level listen and help the child put into more words what they are feeling you are feeling shoved aside you arent getting so much attention as you used to mummy and daddy are so tired and grumpy and you think its the babys fault the child will nod and because they have been heard and feel understood they will not have to keep protesting then the wise parent will say we must make sure you dont feel left out that you still get your bedtime story and were sorry you have been made to feel like this tomorrow we will have some extra time together just you and me after this the child will not resent their new sibling as much they might even find an advantage or two to having the baby around a wise parent knows that you listen to acknowledge and empathise with the feelings underneath behaviour and statements you disagree with because there is not a feeling that cannot be made sense of once it is put into context in order to repair our relationships what we need to do is pay attention to three areas what you feel what i feel and the context if we just talk about the context as if the debate is a simple problem with a single rational solution we are ignoring the others feelings and not acknowledging our own we are pretending to be computers but we are not computers reason by itself will not work because we are first and foremost creatures of feeling when we do not acknowledge the other persons feelings they have to shout louder and dig up more narratives that fit their feelings over brexit both sides have been doing a lot of shouting but how much listening have we done if the remain camp had listened more and listened better could we have heard the disenfranchisement and thrashed it out on a different battlefield if we had slowed everything down listened to fears found a way of framing them and taken action to include people who feel like an older child being pushed aside would europe even have been the issue when we consider only our own feelings we blame the other when we dont acknowledge our own feelings we dont admit their bias in the facts and narratives we present to back up our arguments if we are to go forward together as a united kingdom we need to stop blaming and overrationalising we need to start acknowledging our own and other peoples feelings so we can understand better where they are coming from and why they feel as they do all feelings are relevant and real even if the facts we find to back them up may prove not to be i could start speculating now as to the feelings that underpinned the vote to leave was it disenfranchisement was it a fear of losing identity or of being taken over in one way or another or instead of speculating about other peoples feelings i could ask them instead and rather than simply

some issues are totemic and symbolise the challenges that remain in terms of achieving gender equality the gender pay gap is one of them the average british woman earns around p for every earned by a man this discrepancy exists for several reasons because women are concentrated in lowpaid jobs and take on the lions share of unpaid work particularly the care of children but it is also because of pay discrimination women being paid less than their male counterparts for the same work or work of equal value we dont always hear this part of the story but some recent cases have been reminders that it still exists first the bbc agreed to pay some of its female staff more under threat of an equalpay challenge essex university also decided to pay its female academics more to redress the balance in pay brainlabs gave every woman in the organisation a pay rise the pay gap tax there is a pattern here once employers compared their male and female salaries they found an imbalance that they couldnt explain away research shows that this also happens at graduate entry level male graduates continue to earn more k than female graduates k even when compared with women who did the same subject went to a similar university and went into the same industry the fact that some organisations have addressed this discrimination is a step in the right direction but how many equalpay claims do we really see very few the lack of pay transparency in the workplace means its almost impossible to make pay comparisons with coworkers without that you have no case employment tribunal fees are prohibitively expensive the process can be extremely stressful and can take years to resolve moreover claims that are brought are almost always settled before they get to tribunal meaning the general public is less likely to hear about them new gender pay gap reporting regulations due in october will mean that employers with staff or more there are around of them in the uk will have to publish their gender pay gap figures for both basic salary and bonus payments they will also be required to identify the number of male and female employees according to quartile pay bands throughout their organisations this wont give individuals the transparency they need to bring a claim but it will force employers to think systematically about the gender pay gap and the inequities that may lie within their own organisations we at the fawcett society welcome the regulations but we want to go further we need a step change in assumptions to start in a different place and break the male model of work every job should be advertised on a flexible working basis unless there is a good business case not to we need to end the motherhood penalty and move to a presumption of equality for leave entitlements including paying enhanced rates for dads so that they can afford to take them we need to extend the new requirements to smaller organisations too fawcett recommends those with employees or more with these changes the gender pay gap may finally become something that motivates employers to act because they want to be seen as an employer of choice for women in an increasingly competitive labour market and that might just drive change sam smethers will be taking part in a discussion entitled who earns more the pay gap at home and abroad on sunday june at the royal festival hall as part of the

a few nights ago i was watching the evening news as a selfconfessed news junkie its hard for me to forego my daily dose of whats going on in the world but that particular night i found myself struggling and then disengaging completely literally switching off the newscast consisted of nothing but journalists standing in front of assorted court houses to report on the latest atrocities mostly people assaulting or even killing their loved ones and theres only so much of that news i can still take maybe its because i have young kids maybe its because ive entered the mid part of my life but increasingly i find myself in need of solutions not just crises i want to hear the changemakers the outofthebox thinkers and the clever responses and see the people who are changing the world one good idea at a time in australia a woman is murdered each week on average by an intimate partner already this year violence has claimed the lives of more than women its crucial we keep covering what malcolm turnbull called our national disgrace only by shining a light or better a torch on the problem of domestic violence and the efforts to stop it can we hope to achieve meaningful change my issue isnt with the light itself but where we choose to shine it new research from violenceprevention organisation our watch and australias national research organisation for womens safety anrows just confirmed that of the reporting on violence against women last year looked only at tragic individual cases without exploring causes or possible solutions its almost as if its more important to know how a woman was killed than why or what we can do to stop it happening again to me this is just as newsworthy but its mostly absent from public conversation we need far more reporting on responses and cures to social ills not just the disease itself imagine more headlines like how this town brought down domestic violence rates in the usa the push for this type of reporting is driven by the solutions journalism network led by awardwinning new york times reporters simply pointing out social problems they argue might raise awareness or even outrage but wont spur reform alone for that you need to tell the whole story whats more solutions journalism strengthens accountability how can you hold peoples feet to the fire for bad performance if they have no idea whats possible or what better actually looks like we tried a more solutionsbased approach in hitting home our documentary about domestic violence with journalist sarah ferguson highlighting new policing techniques court innovations prison programs and initiatives to help women stay safe in their own homes in the days following the broadcast the national helpline respect saw an increase of in calls the public is thirsty for solutions the bbc reported last year that almost twothirds of its viewers under want news that helps them learn about solutions not just issues newsmakers win too research by the university of texas found that solutions headlines yield more clicks and that readers spend more time on the page more confident that they themselves could contribute to solving problems im not advocating feelgood news im talking about wellresearched stories told with journalistic rigour stories that acknowledge success and failure focus on evidence and outcomes and examine limitations candidly for instance if the nsw governments trial to tag domestic violence offenders with ankle bracelets fails to produce results we need to know why but if it works it could be rolled out across the country valuable lessons are to be learned either way so far us newsrooms are working with the solutions journalism network here in australia some of our finest reporters clearly share its aims producing stellar work that cuts through we just need a lot more of it last week nominations opened for the second annual our watch awards administered by the walkley foundation these awards recognise excellence in journalism that contributes to a deeper understanding of violence against women its drivers and how it can be prevented its also a great opportunity to showcase solutionsdriven stories its not an easy sell of course as journalists every fibre of our being is geared towards exposing wrongdoing ironically the research on the medias treatment of domestic violence reporting from our watch and anrows suffers somewhat from the same tendency the key findings the bit that people actually read are all about what needs to be improved the good news it does exist is buried on page of the report there it says that explicit victimblaming and other misconceptions are uncommon suggesting that journalists are attempting to present an accurate picture of the social circumstances in which violence against women occurs at least thats something we newsmakers can build upon but as with all solutionsbased reports this ray of hope shouldnt be buried as an afterthought,2016-06,night ago wa

fathersjustice staged another of its misogynist demos yesterday briefly barging into the studio of itvs loose women while it was on air claiming the programme denigrates men they waved notes and yfronts printed with pants to the csa in a protest calling on fathers to boycott the child maintenance service replacing the old child support agency which they say has reduced dads to the status of cashpoints and sperm banks why now because its fathers day on sunday however a boycott by its members may be barely noticed by the mothers who receive no maintenance at all for their children if separated mothers werent so hard pressed trying to earn a living and care for their children alone it should be them storming the tv studios and standing on roofs to protest at the extraordinary failure of successive governments to get fathers to pay what they owe towards their children the csacms has fallen out of the news these days as the government hopes it will be forgotten but i get letters from desperate mothers such as emma from sunderland shes had not a penny from her childs father for two years so he now owes her over did the cms help not at all they wrote to her as they do now to all mothers of parents with care are mothers to ask if she would write off the debt the official letter to mothers suggests they make their own private arrangements with fathers saying some clients in a similar position to you tell us that they do not want their child maintenance to be managed by the new organisation and wish to make a fresh start by writing off their arrears no equivalent letter was sent to fathers suggesting they clear their past debt by paying it as cases are transferred over from the csa to the cms the aim is to get as many as possible off the books altogether both current payments and arrears by charging mothers for the service it works as mothers despair and give up some of csa cases have now been transferred over to the cms but only of mothers affected have decided to pay the new fees and apply to the cms the dwp must be pleased as it had publicly estimated that would pursue their claims all the pressure in official letters is to deter mothers the fee may be a mild block along with charging fathers but the evidence suggests mothers just give up when prodded by these letters as the cms closes down old cases still have unpaid arrears that are being officially forgotten though not by the mothers who have struggled over the years without support the government has the power to attach the earnings of fathers but many avoid it emmas former partners employer a large company failed to fill out the forms to get his debt deducted at source causing delay and then it let him declare himself selfemployed despite still working for the same company to avoid it altogether gingerbread a national charity for single parents has a new report out today reviewing the latest official statistics it says the csas disastrous record in collecting unpaid child maintenance has led to almost bn of outstanding arrears the dwps latest estimate is that only m is ever likely to be recovered nearly half of fathers in the system owe unpaid maintenance uncollected by the new cms with not paying in just the last three months the new system has already clocked up m in unpaid maintenance and fewer than half the eligible children receive anything at all this ought to matter to the dwp as nearly half of singleparent families live below the poverty line analysis by gingerbread shows that for the poorest families receipt of child maintenance lifts one in five out of poverty at a time when austerity cuts are set to leave single parents with a loss of in income by as a result of tax and welfare changes fathers financial support is even more important the institute for fiscal studies calculates that poverty rates for singleparent families will double by but families have outstanding debts owing despite now charging for the new service the cms is collecting only of the maintenance due to those who do sign up gingerbread chief executive fiona weir says britains child maintenance system is contributing to a culture where

aid a domestic abuse charity covering england in partnership with welsh womens aid is calling for people whose work embeds them in communities to become ambassadors and reach out to those being victimised by partners the participants will be asked to be alert to warning signs of domestic abuse such as nonphysical coercive control if they believe someone could be in danger they are asked to give individuals advice on available local services the scheme was launched on wednesday at first it will be run as a pilot in three areas across england and wales with the aim of extending nationally as part of the effort to identify early on women experiencing domestic abuse the scheme is funded through comic relief and money from the now defunct tampon tax the ask me pilot scheme arose after womens aid workers discovered that victims of domestic abuse often reported that people in their local communities had missed opportunities to help them fifty community ambassadors will be selected for each area and will be given two days training to help them understand and spot the signs of domestic abuse and direct women towards further help and support they will not unilaterally call the police over any suspicions asked who the ideal candidate for the job would be a spokesperson for womens aid said i guess really a hairdresser would be ideal theres a lot of small talk that happens there and relationships built also in religious communities as well if there is a priest or a rabbi or somebody that someone can confide in obviously their job wont allow them to go to the police but they can give advice about what to do its really important for womens aid to reach the religious communities as well womens aid hopes to attract interest also from community and voluntary sector

open from wednesday for professionals in the pilot areas which include brighton amp hove and east sussex kensington and chelsea westminster and hammersmith and fulham in london and powys wales polly neate chief executive of womens aid in england said many women live with abuse for years without telling anyone and often have contact with several agencies or people in their local community before they get help these women have few opportunities to disclose their abuse because their space for action is extremely limited therefore when an opportunity occurs it is vital they receive the right support most people are not open to hearing that abuse is happening or do not know how to respond appropriately our ask me initiative will equip individuals in local communities with the basic skills knowledge and tools to have a supportive conversation and provide an appropriate response eleri butler chief executive of welsh womens aid said living with abuse in rural areas means survivors are

is it healthy for children to see their parents row yes according to fern britton who has spoken out in favour of couples arguing in front of their children tv presenter believes it is good for offspring to witness arguments as it shows them how real relationships work says a daily mail headline over an article in which briton says that couples who dont row are boring and that she is glad her children witness this normal part of a real relationship however in years of clinical practice ive not seen the benefits to which she refers the results ive seen include increased anxiety impulsivity and selfishness and a lack of good problemsolving skills we cant know the exact kind of rows britton has in her own household but the article mentions quarrels rows and arguments if those are indeed what she means then i definitely disagree that children or any onlookers benefit from witnessing such events i dont think the couple benefits either of course there will be disagreements in any relationship no two people are alike so theyll never share exactly the same outlook on every issue disagreements are indeed real and negotiations and compromise are the reality when people try to live together harmoniously thats not in question however the key to a healthy relationship one where problems get solved and one that benefits the children is how disagreements are handled not whether they exist when we let ourselves become angry or engage in heated exchanges were allowing ourselves to be totally and utterly selfish we give ourselves permission to release negative emotion without regard to the effect it will have on anyone watching we dont mind if we hurt the person with whom were arguing in fact we may deliberately wish to do so and we arent trying to solve the problem that gave rise to the argument in the first place because we cant be rational problemsolvers when were overwhelmed by emotion when couples argue in front of their children there are four messages the children take away first they see that their parents are either not well able to control their emotions or they dont care if the negativity theyre releasing distresses anyone watching them this can make them feel anxious and unimportant second theres no need to bother with selfcontrol because its more important to release your own discomfort immediately never mind when it is or where you are this will encourage children to act impulsively rather than rationally third responding to your own discomfort immediately is more important than thinking about how to solve the problem that upset you this suggests that children dont need to think longterm when theyre challenged and last it doesnt matter if you think only of your own needs and ignore the discomfort of others this will encourage children to behave selfishly and may limit the friendships they can keep parents are childrens first role models and their most important ones youve no doubt heard it said that when it comes to influencing your children what you do counts for more than what you say these are true words,2016-06,healthy child see parent row yes according fern britton ha spoken favour couple arguing front child

the statement that brock turners victim read out in the us court was no normal testimony it symbolised a new articulacy for the anger distress defiance and painfully clawed together dignity of all sexual assault survivors which has always been there but in the past was submerged under the toxic murk of warped police protocol and societal shaming what guts it took for that young woman to write and read out such a piece calmly describing the grotesque nature of her attack sparing no one least of all herself from the explicit details how she lay unconscious humiliatingly exposed behind a dumpster soil and other debris from the ground between her legs pine needles in her hair underneath her fratboy attacker the one with those great swimming speeds the survivor also thanked the two men heroes who came to her aid demonstrating that nothing not even her own brutal assault was going to rob her of her capacity to both embody and appreciate humanity the statement was incredibly powerful perhaps too strong for some in cases such as these some people would rather not deal with specifics blackouts dumpsters abrasions because that means letting go of their pipedream that anything bar centralcasting strangerrapist in a dark alleyway merely amounts to stupid drunk skanks deviously carping about sex they belatedly regretted however amid the statements strength and honesty another moment popped out one that seemed to go against the spirit of everything else while at the same time fitting in perfectly it was when the survivor spoke about being paranoid that people would find out that it was her after all shed been through she was saying she feared being outed despite all she was and all shed become this courageous orator whod commanded the attention and respect of the world she was still scared of being that person that thing the victim this may have been the bravest part of the statement how much easier would it have been for her to fake a brittle bravado that she did not truly feel instead she spoke the truth about her terror of people discovering her identity and by doing so she highlighted the greater darker truth that for her and every other sexual assault victim these fears are not mere paranoia the raped are never responsible for their rapes yet even today the shame of rape the stain of it remains a burden on the victim not only in the persistent archaic babble what was she wearinghow much did she drink but also in less obvious more insidious forms there is a sense that just by being sexually violated the victim has been forever tainted and defined by the crime this is what rape does it stands victims in front of a smeared broken mirror and lies to them about who and what they are and how theres no escape for many victims the only thing that could be worse is if their identities are exposed and theres not even the bleakest chance of getting on with their lives this isnt weakness or hiding this is a logical reaction to a society that even today persists in its prurient response to rape dictating that the sexual nature of the crime both defiles and defines the victim as much as the attacker maybe even more at which point it wouldnt matter that wellmeaning people including the vice president joe biden praise and comfort you youre a victim thats all you are youve been sexually assaulted thats all that counts so even as i applaud this young womans articulacy i also respect and understand her fear of losing her anonymity society has a long way to go before the shame is placed not only firmly but also solely where it belongs time for bernie to exit stage left what is bernie sanders playing at even after his backers conceded that the fight is over and after a meeting with president obama he seems determined not to step down admit defeat and endorse hillary clinton as the us democratic candidate it seems time for someone brave to whisper in sanders ear bernie posterity has not beckoned but your uber cab has arrived otherwise soon the moment will come when sanders stops being the valid interesting former candidate who for a time at least captured the public imagination instead he will start looking like the annoying guy who refuses to leave the party long after everyone else has departed sanders will be there sullenly sprawled on the carpet drinking the dregs of the home brew eating old pizza crusts telling you that your cat has an attitude problem and asking if he could kip the night aw go on dont be tight he wont be any trouble honest hell just lie on the floor snuggled up under a paper tablecloth dont worry about weird noises in the night itll just be him looking for the loo he wont flush in case it wakes you up and could you make him breakfast the next morning and order him a cab and pay for it ta appreciate it by the way do you want those leftover dips because if youre just going to throw them away yes sanders is in imminent danger of becoming the us democrats nightmare guest

it is an established principle of parenthood that one of your chief functions is to teach your children although its never quite clear what you should put on the curriculum however i have learned more from my children than they have ever learned from me you have less power than you think the amount of influence you have on children or anyone else is limited children supposedly the most malleable individuals we come into close contact with are nevertheless fully their own people children are not just small adults but creatures with a whole range of distinct belief systems and many of these are not susceptible to reason argument or anything else they are extraordinarily impressionable it is true but crucially not in the ways you think or expect selfishness laziness and egotism can be beautiful no im not talking about fathers i dont know how they get away with it but children are highly inclined towards all of the above and yet remain wondrous charming and irresistible its a trick some try to carry on into adult life this tends not to work out well rationality and justice do not rule children are inclined to make the deluded assumption that there is a just solution to any dispute and that their parents will duly impose it parents often start off parenthood believing the same thing however it turns out that the way blame and punishment is apportioned for any particular alleged misdemeanour is as often as not determined by at best limited facts and the boundaries of adult reason at worst by mendacity and low cunning usually on the part of a sibling any given act is always unfair to someone parents discover that like governments they have to make do with order rather than justice you are not as important as you thought you were this often comes as a particular shock to fathers mothers work it out the moment they get pregnant or long before fatherhood is largely an exercise in attaining humility in the face of brute circumstance until they have children a lot of men entertain the conceit consciously or not that the world revolves around them after children arrive they realise they have just made way for something much more important than themselves the next generation which at birth is beginning the urgent project of edging their parents out of the waymothers tend to take this for granted fathers need to have to have it spelled out repeatedly and in some cases indefinitely time moves faster than you thought once it passed at a stately pace marked by the odd wrinkle now you see it in constant rapid motion as you witness the unending transformations of your children children teach you about ephemerality and therefore mortality loving and liking are largely unrelated if you havent learned this already from your partner your children are here to clarify it for you loving is better than being loved you always thought you wanted someone to love you then you discover that the big payoff for being a parent is not so much to be a target of someone elses love but to have a repository for your own to be loved is desirable to be able to love it turns out is indispensable the world is more complicated than you thought once upon a time you thought someone somewhere knew most of the answers even if you didnt but subject to the simple relentless questioning of a child you soon realise that the world mostly comprises unanswerable questions how can you tell when sour cream goes bad what colour is a mirror if a person is born deaf what language do they think in its not that these questions didnt exist before its just that you didnt have to think about them now you know how little you know and as socrates son or daughter doubtless patiently explained to him that is the beginning of wisdom

austerity policies and and welfare cuts are causing poverty and inequality according to a damning united nations un investigation into childrens rights in the uk the un committee on the rights of the child said it was seriously concerned about the disproportionate impact on poorer children of a range of government policies from the benefit cap and tax credit cuts to mental health it calls on the uk which is a voluntary signatory to the un convention on the rights of the child crc to do more to ensure childrens rights to adequate health living standards housing and education are met the un report says it is concerned that uk child poverty rates remain high and calls on the government which dropped statutory child poverty targets this year to reestablish detailed and concrete measures to ensure it meets its un poverty reduction commitments within a set time frame other un recommendations ask the uk government to strictly implement its ban on councils placing families in temporary accommodation including bampbs for longer than the sixweek legal limit provide children with disabilities a comprehensive package of services and to help them with transition to adulthood systematically collect data on food and nutrition for children in order to identify the causes of food insecurity and malnutrition the committee last reported on the uk in making this the first time that it has examined the effect of post economic social and welfare policies on childrens rights the committee is seriously concerned at the effects that recent fiscal policies and allocation of resources have had in contributing to inequality in childrens enjoyment of their rights disproportionately affecting children in disadvantaged situations the report says the childrens rights alliance for england said the report demonstrated that too often children bore the brunt of spending cuts and policy decisions were made without proper consideration of how they affect children the alliances director louise king said the uns verdict on the uks treatment of children should act as a wakeup call that much more needs to be done to prioritise childrens rights in england the government said it would continue to work closely with partners to understand the main concerns of charities and children on the uks implementation of its uncrc obligations in the light of the report a government spokesperson said all children deserve the best start in life and growing up in a household where people work is the best way to ensure the economic security they need that is why our welfare reforms incentivise work and ensure we have a system which is fair to those who need it and those who pay for it however the un calls on ministers to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the cumulative impact on children of all the social security and tax credit reforms the government has introduced since it says policies such as the benefit cap and the twochild limit on tax credits undermine childrens rights to an adequate standard of living because they restrict the amount of benefit to a family regardless of size or need last year the uk supreme court ruled that the benefit cap put ministers in clear breach of their childrens rights obligations because it broke the link between benefits and need and therefore risked leaving claimants unable to house feed or clothe their family alison garnham chief executive of the child poverty action group said this is a powerful report which catalogues recent cuts and welfare changes that ride roughshod over childrens rights it reads as an indictment of the governments failure to prioritise children in its decisions on social security in the face of a projected increase in child poverty by the committee sounds a strong warning child poverty reduction targets must be reinstated and at the heart of the governments forthcoming life chances strategy although it is a signatory to the crc the government cannot be compelled to comply with the uns findings aoife nolan professor of international human rights law at the university of nottingham said the uns observations arent binding in the way that a court judgment is but they are important findings by an expert body on the extent to which the uk is in compliance with its international human childrens rights obligations they cannot be relied on directly as the basis of a legal claim before uk domestic courts as the crc hasnt been domestically incorporated but they can be used to encourage or embarrass the government into action,2016-06,austerity policy welfare cut causing

the nameless survivor of former stanford student brock turners hideous sexual assault won an extraordinary victory with her letter to him now read by millions of people its as though she erected a statue that said this is who you are a vile and despicable person this is what you did a violent and repulsive series of acts and this is who i am someone who is more than what you did and who you failed to destroy we need a national rape monument or a tomb to the unknown domestic violence victim something should make people notice that were in an epidemic and say enough is enough something should say that we should take the extraordinary measures we would if the carnage was not of women but what would a monument to the victims look like it could be one of those gigantic electronic signboards ticking off numbers there are so many numbers huge numbers horrifying numbers because it cant be a memorial memorials are for things in the past if it were a monument like maya lins vietnam memorial stonemasons would be chiseling new names on it around the clock would we plan for it to expand acknowledging that in the current order of things the corpses will keep piling up there are dozens of rapes an hour hundreds or thousands of gender violence crimes a day just think about last week alone there was a lot of attention paid to the murder of a professor at ucla but not so much to mainak sarkars other victim his estranged wife yearold medical student ashey hasti and there was this ruckus about the light sentence from a sympathetic judge for turner in the stanford sexual assault case thats just a week of highprofile violence in california most of it hardly makes the news in hillsboro ohio only about an hour from where turner grew up in dayton timothy harewood is believed to have killed his oneyearold daughter and tried to kill the childs mother his exgirlfriend then killed himself after failing also last week in houston yearold karen perez was found stuffed under a sink dead and her boyfriend was charged with the murder he recorded on his cell phone because hed gotten the idea that murdering women was kind of awesome and ashley solano was beaten to death in a laundry room in adelphi washington her former boyfriend was charged with the murder thats still only a tiny portion of the violence of last week or this week and next week there will be more close to three women a day are murdered by men they are or were intimately involved with an epidemic that leaves us with more than corpses a year most of them are stories we will never read about names we will never know and theres one rape every seconds about a year according to the rape abuse amp incest national network using department of justice statistics most go unreported because reporting it lodges the survivor in a system that often seems to shame and punish victims more than perpetrators also several women are beaten by partners and former partners every minute in the united states the center for disease control reported in an estimated million ipv intimate partner violence victimizations occur among us women ages and older each year this violence results in nearly million injuries more than of which require medical attention in addition ipv victims also lose a total of nearly million days of paid work the equivalent of more than fulltime jobs and nearly million days of household productivity as a result of the violence intimate partner violence constitutes of the violent crime in this country and the toughoncrime politicians never got tough on it which should remind us that not only do many women die of this violence but millions in this country and most others maybe if you could quantify it globally itd be billions live in terror of this intimate violence this is the real terrorism in the united states and elsewhere the force that actually instills fear and limits freedom for many of us the death toll doesnt address how many millions of women live in terror of attack at home at work in a laundry room on a campus nor does it address what it means to live in a society where one out of five women has been raped and a lot of the rest of us young old trans cis urban suburban on the reservation black white brown live in fear of rape and amidst constant reminders of it we need to make the scope impact and cost financial and psychological visible that would be one important step toward making it intolerable a step toward ending it or at least radically reducing it there has been a marked decline in the past few decades and feminism has achieved much in shifting how many men as well as women think about the problem these reforms are good but we need a revolution maybe only that is an adequate monument to the vast suffering the numbers show the stanford student built her own monument and it looks like a cage for brock turners reputation most victims and survivors wont get anything like it unless we agree to build one together,2016-06,nameless survivor former stanford student brock turner hideous sexual assault extraordinary victory letter read million people though erected statue said vile despicable person

domestic violence and justice services will receive a m boost in the australian capital territory courtesy of a a year levy the government of the territory containing australias capital canberra revealed the safer families levy in its budget on tuesday it is believed to be the first such tax to pay for domestic violence services and prevention in the world nicholas cowdery chairman of the white ribbon campaign to end male violence towards women said the levy was a rather innovative way to raise funds and a first for australia the m package includes m for a fulltime coordinatorgeneral for family safety m for case management and coordination of services for victims of family violence and m to improve child protection services in australia the levy follows a national ad campaign to combat negative attitudes towards women and a royal commission into family violence in the state of victoria which made recommendations and prompted a m investment in domestic violence justice services and housing around the world there has been groundswell to combat domestic violence after a report in the uk in by the inspectorate of constabulary that condemned the overall police response and reports that find domestic violence is consistently underreported in december china introduced the countrys first antidomestic violence law which prohibits any form of domestic violence including psychological abuse and helps streamline the process for obtaining restraining orders in his budget speech on tuesday the act chief minister and treasurer andrew barr said family violence is unacceptable it is not a police problem or a government problem or a poor peoples problem or a canberra problem it is everyones problem family violence does not discriminate it is a national issue that touches the lives of australians everywhere the package includes m to prosecute alleged perpetrators of family violence m for police to help victims get apprehended violence orders and m for legal aid it also provides a brokerage and bond fund to assist victims seeking to escape family violence with immediate expenses and m for domestic violence and rape crisis centres barr said in this budget we take decisive steps to address coordination and communication issues to help our hardworking staff on the front line identify and prevent family violence we will make the changes we need in the criminal justice system so it is easier for victims to navigate and easier to take strong action against perpetrators according to reports the liberal leader jeremy hanson said he supported the intent of the domestic violence package but disagreed on how to fund it i certainly applaud a number of the measures that have been put forward by the government he said what were seeing is that instead of it being a core priority out of the budget the government is in a position where it has to levy home owners to pay for a response to domestic violence this should be core business it should be an absolute priority barr said recent reports by the territory government and the royal commission into family violence in the state of victoria made it clear more needed to be done to prevent family violence and we need new sources of revenue to fund it the per year family violence levy will apply to all residential and rural properties it comes on top a increase in general rates followed by a rise in july when rates will be frozen for three years cowdery said the levy would give funding certainty to family violence services allowing them to better plan their programs the most important lesson that has to be learned by those running antidomestic violence programs and apportioning funds is there has to be good collaboration between bodies working in the field coordination of effort playing to the strengths of individual organisations and combining them to provide a better overall program he said cowdery said the coordinatorgeneral could help achieve this coordination of programs to deal with family violence he said funding the justice system to deal with the consequences of domestic violence was good but we mustnt lose sight of the fact that when more resources are spent on prevention and when prevention is effective there is less demand for services to deal with the consequences cowdery said engaging men to stop domestic violence which is one of white ribbons main programs was particularly important he welcomed the act governments pledge to spend on a residential behaviour change program for men who use or are at risk of using violence the victorian royal commissions recommendations focused on breaking down a siloed system to increase cooperation between organisations and systems preventing and responding to domestic violence,2016-06,domestic violence

finding affordable childcare can be a struggle for any family but for parents who work outside traditional ninetofive hours the search is even more difficult figures from the family and childcare trust show that only of local authorities provide sufficient childcare for people who do shift work or have unusual working patterns a figure that has fallen from in we get a lot of emails from mums many from the nhs who have shift changes at very little notice says mandy garner the editor of workingmumscouk people are often patching together childcare and it can be so stressful an increase in the number of people doing ad hoc work means more families are looking for flexible and affordable childcare we have got more parents working outside normal office hours or as freelancers or on zerohour contracts says jill rutter the head of policy and research at the family and childcare trust these workers may need childcare one week and not the next and will have problems if forced to commit to set days nurseries and childminders tend not to operate before am or beyond pm and are not able to offer parents different days each week in accordance with their changing shift patterns strict rules on how many carers they need to have for each child mean they are unable to easily take extra children and if they provide for a child who is not there they will make a loss liz bayram the chief executive of the professional association for childcare and early years pacey says it can also be expensive for nurseries to offer evening and weekendservices they have to pay for staff outside of normal working hours and it is hard to recruit staff willing to work in that way she says firefighter rachael cooper says returning to work after maternity leave might not be feasible for her because of the lack of childcare options on offer her working pattern means doing two days from am to pm two nights from pm to am and then having four days off the eightday cycle means she never works the same days each week making it impossible for her sixmonthold daughter erin to access a nursery and difficult for a childminder to accommodate her no nurseries can accommodate different days each week and a nanny would be really expensive she says also i want erin to go to nursery to learn and to socialise with other children the other option would be to pay for nursery fulltime but then she may only be going one day a week sometimes cooper has spoken to her employer about flexible working but that would involve a job share and still would not mean fixed working days the other option would be a day job in an office but i did that when i was pregnant and i hated it she says my parents live in turkey and although my husband is selfemployed he has two lads working for him so needs to be there i think we will end up with one fixed day at nursery maybe a childminder and my motherinlaw will retire to look after her but if these things dont happen i will have to give up work or do something else even if cooper and workers like her do find irregular or outofhours childcare it is often not eligible for free funding all three and fouryearolds and some twoyearolds currently get free hours a week of early education childcare for weeks of the year this is set to increase to hours a week from there are strict rules however about who can provide these hours and under what circumstances a childminder has to be ofstedregistered and must provide the care in their own home between am and pm for a minimum of hours which does not help parents who need childcare in the evening or early morning within the family home parents needing outofhours childcare lose on all fronts because it can be up to more expensive although they may be eligible for childcare vouchers they are unable to access universal free hours and there are restrictions on eligibility for working tax credits recognising a need for flexible affordable childcare yvette olivermighten launched an outofhours athome childcare service in nottingham in home childcare offers wraparound ofstedregistered childcare to fit either side of the school day as well as outofhours care for irregular workers the service can cost as little as a child an hour in line with the national average but this is based on three children so is most affordable for larger families or people sharing the service outofhours care can cost to more depending on the times in our model evening childcare is charged at the same rate as day care however we charge more for unsocial hours such as late in the evening overnight or very early in the morning says olivermighten this service meets the criteria for working tax credits and childcare vouchers but is not eligible for free hours because although it uses registered childminders they operate as home carers and by definition childminding can only be provided in the childminders own home parttime gp natasha hulme spends a year on a nanny who works three days a week as a partner in her practice natasha is classed as selfemployed and is unable to access a taxfree childcare voucher scheme the nanny looks after twoyearold edward and fouryearold henry from am until natasha or her consultant husband david returns from work which can be between pm and pm we can afford it but we have to be careful with money if we could have the free universal childcare hours paid to the nanny that would help she says in recognition of the problem the government has run a consultation on plans to broaden the types of hours offered the education and childcare minister sam gyimah has said that childcare needs to be more flexible as well as more affordable with greater choice over the hours available to parents the free hours are currently only available between am and pm and the new scheme plans to extend this to between am and pm though it will depend on providers willing to offer these hours some feel the plans do not go far enough because they do not address the need for care in the home or ad hoc hours the government is beginning to wake up to the issue and realise there is a need out there for flexible childcare but it is expensive the government is only looking at half of the solution it needs to consider more flexible models such as home childcare and what parents need says olivermighten if you are a shiftworking lone parent with one child how do you work and have affordable childcare we see parents all the time who say they have given up work as they cant afford childcare and yet they want to

we have two children and the older one is he has been slow to pick up on social cues and is not as socially advanced as his peers lying comes easily to him he is selfabsorbed possibly narcissistic impulsive keen to win peers admiration and hooked on sugar i think his selfesteem is not good age nine he stole a bag of sweets from a shop age he started stealing money from my purse my husband and i have spoken to him about it on several occasions and taken away privileges as punishment today i discovered he had stolen more money from me and used a strangers credit card to purchase game points my son is adamant that he found the card outside this week his headmaster called me in to tell me my son had written a note to a younger girl in the name of another boy telling her he was going to do things to her content not published i was shocked and disturbed i let my son see how upset i was and my husband and i spoke to him about how wrong this was and why this was so wrong we try to monitor his screen use but neither of us is very engaged with the internet we think that there is a lot of sex talk in the playground we give our son pocket money and some of the coveted computer games my husband is very engaged and thoughtful we are both affectionate to him try to talk to him and provide positive modelling his wellbeing is a daily conversation between my husband and myself but my son has no conscience and i feel utterly overwhelmed anxious and frightened that we appear to have a sociopath for a son how do we get him to appreciate the impact of his actions on others i know his brain is still developing but i dont know what to do he goes to secondary school next year so will be further from our influence and control i also feel that he is like me i am selfish and a liar i am an impatient angry person and sometimes that leaks out at the children i have to work full time so taking all this into account my children do not get enough of my time and attention my husband would describe my parenting style as high criticism high warmth i feel that my son has inherited my unpleasant personality first what did you do about the found credit card this is fraudulent and he is above the age of criminal responsibility its evident that your son needs attention i contacted ann horne a child and adolescent psychotherapist who has worked extensively with troubled adolescents its clear hes on a path and its escalating and its the escalation we need to worry about horne said i do think you need to get proper support for him and for all of you including your other child this will be having an impact on the younger sibling you need to explore with a professional why your son may be slow to pick up on social clues and be less socially advanced than his peers if you dont want to go through your gp the link above will help you find someone near you the first thing i asked horne was why children steal it usually goes a way back she said and can be a way of looking for something they lack it may be a sign that a child needs something but doesnt have a clue what money is usually a substitute for affection its a bit of the parent this isnt said so you can blame yourself further but maybe it will be a piece of the jigsaw you asked me not to publish a key fact about yourself that i think is rather important and i would like you to look at that and what effect it may be having on your family and your son your son is a long way from being a sociopath said horne being a sociopath or a psychopath are established psychological structures hes still fluid still young still a work in progress but there is a sense of him getting into some selfsustaining or his idea of it by trying to make himself selfsufficient by stealing money of shutting himself off from what is around him what he wrote to the girl at school is completely unacceptable and both horne and i questioned what he had been watching on screen im afraid you need to very much engage with the internet when you have children who will do so bring any computer he has access to into the living room advises horne so his use of it is public learn about the internet learn about parental controls and how to use them on screens tablets and phones dont let him have a tv in his own room keep purses locked away these are practical things you can do a couple of things in your letter gave me pause why is your son hooked on sugar you talk of it as if you have no input into his life you seem helpless you are not who is in charge him or you stop being afraid of your own child also when he wrote the note to the girl the key question you didnt ask him was why try to talk at him less and listen to him more your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the guardian kings place york way london n

as school holidays begin churches and community groups are launching schemes to provide children with free lunches to alleviate the burden on poor families through the summer families whose children get free school meals in term time face extra costs during holidays when people are living on a very marginal income it doesnt take much to knock them over said dominic black the vicar of north ormesby in middlesbrough weve noticed in the past few years partly as a result of benefit changes and cuts a huge increase in the number of families coming to us in the summer saying they cant manage most of these are working families he said free school meals are available to children at primary and secondary schools whose parents are receiving benefits or earn less than a year the recent school census showed there are more than million children eligible and claiming free school meals in all state schools in england black estimates that seven in children in his area are entitled to free school meals local churches supported by businesses and charities will offer meals over the summer as part of holiday activity clubs the area has seen marked decline with the loss of heavy industry since the s the most alarming statistic has been in child poverty now reckoned to be at in the neighbourhood said black it brought tears to the eyes of some of our older members of the church who remembered the s depression when we began the food bank in many of those in this proud town that access the food bank are working families usually messed around by benefit delays or sanctions churches in the area have long run summer holiday clubs but have seen a growing need to provide meals black said that mothers would regularly go without food in order to feed their children there were other costs associated with children being at home during school holidays such as extra toilet roll he said sometimes all it takes is a few rolls of toilet paper to cause serious difficulties middlesbrough is planning a series of activity weeks around churches so there will be provision for children throughout the sixweek holiday similar schemes are operating in other dioceses in addlestone surrey the hebrews coffee shop at st pauls church is offering lunches to children who are entitled to free school meals the food comes from surpluses from retailers and outlets and a local food bank ellie pool

high childcare costs are leaving parents who work full time at the national minimum wage thousands of pounds a year short of being able to afford what the public defines as a basic acceptable standard of living research published by the joseph rowntree foundation jrf says benefit cuts and rising costs mean increasing numbers of households in lowpaid jobs will not achieve the minimum income standard needed to live healthily and sociably a twochild couple each working full time on the minimum wage of an hour would fall a year or short of the minimum income standard after paying rent and childcare the study finds the shortfall is even more dramatic for a lone parent working full time at minimum wage who after paying rent and childcare would be a year or a week short of what they require a gap of although the household minimum income standards agreed by public focus groups as part of the study are generally frugal no allowance is made for tobacco or motoring costs for pensioners for example they are far higher than actual levels of earnings enjoyed lowpaid individuals and families the gap is particularly stark for households dependent on social security a twochild couple on outof work benefits would receive just of what the public consider to be an adequate basic income jrf said childcare costs were one of the biggest barriers preventing working families achieving a decent standard of living and called on the government to improve childcare affordability including making it free to families on the lowest incomes julia unwin the chief executive of jrf said childcare has become the one of the biggest barriers to reaching a decent living standard in modern britain work should always be the best route to a better life but these figures show that a comprehensive plan to bring down the high cost of childcare and improve the returns from working more hours is desperately needed having promoted greater access to childcare the government now faces the challenge of ensuring that it truly becomes affordable and available to help ease the strain on parents juggling working and caring a radical overhaul is needed jrf also called for a reversal of cuts to universal credit working allowances to enable working families to keep more of their earnings before benefits are withdrawn some difficult times lie ahead for families that depend on state benefits whether in or out of work the report says the research carried out by loughborough university centre for research in social policy asks the public to define the minimum income required to enable households to afford to buy not just basics such as food clothes and shelter but to participate in social and family life such as occasionally going out taking a modest holiday once a year and buying birthday presents for relatives and friends a couple with two children need to earn at least to meet the basic standards while a lone parent with one child needs to earn the research finds a single person with no children requires a year according to the public a single workingage adult would need to spend a weekly minimum of on food to ensure they eat healthily three times a day the minimum food budget for a pensioner couple was for a couple with two children and for a single parent with one child the publics definitions of a basic minimum income appeared to be influenced by years of austerity with households expected to economise more than than in previous surveys to eat out less often and try harder to seek out deals and bargains families were also expected to rent smaller homes and require their younger children to share bedrooms but there was also an acceptance that basic living standard rises were neccessary in areas such as car use which was seen as increasingly essential because of unreliable and costly public transport and the need to travel further to access job opportunities there was also public support for the idea that provision for childrens developmental needs in the form of social and educational activities and structured childcare was an essential living cost the overall impression is that the priority is to provide and maintain a standard of living that protects children from the effects of austerity and promotes a healthy and happy childhood while still operating within a constrained budget the study says a department for education spokesperson said we know that access to highquality affordable childcare is vital for millions of parents and carers across the country we are doing more than ever before to support the families that need it most with the cost and availability of childcare but we know that more needs to be done thats why we are increasing the support available to parents by doubling free childcare from to hours for working parents of three and fouryearolds introducing taxfree childcare worth up to per child per year and up to for disabled children and this government is increasing support for lowincome parents on universal credit councils must also provide childcare for children up to age for parents who are working studying or training and we are helping schools to offer afterschool and holiday clubs,2016-07,high childcare cost

my parents divorced a couple of years ago they fought a lot i feel sorry for my dad because he would try to stop things from getting worse but couldnt my mum told my younger brother and me that we would be better off and have more fun without dad but that never happened my mum kept the house and the dog and also had custody of us we only see our dad twice a month we never did anything fun like she said we would i feel im being ignored now because my brother has serious anxiety and anger problems which causes my mum to give my brother attention i cry a lot in my bedroom because i just cant talk to her sometimes i just cry suddenly and she gets mad because i dont know how to talk or sometimes i cry because i just need some time with her and she says that im being jealous because of this i like to spend time with my aunt and cousins who are about my age their house is a loving environment and i feel i can tell them anything in may i found out that my mum had a wedding to go to on my birthday and that made me sad i told my aunt and cousins and they made me feel better they even got me a cake and sang happy birthday the day before my birthday on my birthday my mum usually invites her sister and my cousins but for the past two years has invited her boyfriend instead i feel uncomfortable around him and today when she told me he was coming i started to cry and i ran to my room i have been in here the whole day she gets mad when i cry but i dont know how else to let it out when she faces me shes like this big scary monster that i just cannot confront her boyfriend smokes which i hate he ignored me the first couple of times we met and now i stay locked in my room when hes here he is very skinny and i feel like the fattest person in the world next to him i am a little overweight sometimes i feel my aunt cares more about me because when i feel bad she comforts me but my mum says she hates it when i cry you didnt say how old you are but im guessing you are in your teens i think that its great you have written in because to do so and to be able to articulate how you feel takes courage and awareness im sorry your parents split up there are usually two sides to every breakup and its important that your mum and dad take responsibility for their parts but neither are your fault or your problem im sure your mother had all sorts of ideas for fun things you might all do together but real life sometimes gets in the way of dreams and plans perhaps when you can communicate with her see later you could remind her that youd like to do some fun things with her she may not realise how important they were for you adults sometimes forget what matters to their children because they can be too busy doing what they think is best i think its important you try to tell your mum how you feel and why you feel uncomfortable around her boyfriend and see if you cant work out some middle ground perhaps he could smoke outside or not at all in your house and maybe you could try to do some things together maybe next birthday you could organise it and invite who you want i understand that its not easy but when youre having a huge row and she seems like a big scary monster is not the time for that talk try to find a moment when you are getting on well and are calm and then tell her how you would like to spend more time with her just doing stuff if you dont feel you can tell her face to face why not write to her you are able to express yourself very well through the written word i used to write to my parents as a teenager as i got too emotional face to face its hard when you have a sibling who takes all the room on the emotional shelf i cant promise that will change much because family dynamics often get stuck but it wont always be like this i promise because one day you will leave home and different parts of your personality will come out because you will be in different situations with people who are not your family you wont be so defined by your family i hope that if you can tell your mum how you feel she may be able to redress the balance i bet she is also feeling confused and not sure how to help you she probably also thinks you dont like her very much but its important you understand that you are not responsible for her or for the way she feels and its absolutely not your responsibility to make her happy its wonderful that you have your aunt and cousins in larger families its not at all unusual to get what you want or need from different people or to get on better with different family members at times and in fact this is a useful thing to learn one person can rarely give you everything you want crying is nothing to be ashamed of it releases stress hormones you probably find that you feel better after a good cry your mum probably feels helpless when you cry can you see your dad more this is something to discuss with your mum when you are both feeling calm and loving towards each other your problems solved contact annalisa

parental alienation a phenomenon where one parent poisons their child against the other parent has become such a feature of the most difficult family breakdowns that cafcass the children and family court advisory and support service is to offer targeted support for those affected following a governmentfunded intensive therapeutic pilot programme distinct from the alltoocommon acrimony between divorcing parents the syndrome is an internationally recognised phenomenon in america and canada parenting coordinators are ordered and supervised by the courts to help restore relationships between parents and children identified as alienated in mexico and brazil alienating a child from a parent is a criminal act psychiatrist richard gardner developed the concept years ago defining it as a disorder that arises primarily in the context of child custody disputes its primary manifestation is the childs campaign of denigration against a parent a campaign that has no justification it results from the combination of a programming brainwashing parents indoctrinations and the childs own contributions to the vilification of the target parent the assistant director of cafcass sarah parsons said parental alienation is responsible for around of the most intransigent cases that come before the family courts we already train our social workers to recognise the issue but this takes helping families experiencing it one step further parental alienation is estimated to be present in of divorces involving children a figure that is thought to be increasing other research has found about of children and adolescents in north america experience parental alienation miriam a lecturer and artist whose name has been changed was packing to take her young son on holiday when her former husband emailed to say she would never see her child again the boy was staying with his father for the weekend and the email said had made such serious allegations against his mother that he wouldnt ever be coming home it would be days before miriam next saw her son im just a normal mum and out of nowhere i was being accused of false and fabricated allegations of a sexual nature against my son that were absolutely harrowing she said it was horrendous since their divorce seven years previously miriams former husband had waged a campaign of parental alienation against her using almost all the specific strategies identified through research studies with adults who were alienated as children and with targeted parents these include a parent constantly badmouthing and belittling the other parent to the point that the child sees no value in the targeted parent at all limiting contact with the targeted parent forbidding discussion and pictures of them creating the impression that the targeted parent does not love the child or is dangerous forcing the child to reject the other parent and asking the child to spy and keep secrets from them judges in britain are also increasingly recognising the phenomenon in one case the judge wrote about a case where she was forced to transfer residence to reestablish a relationship between a child and an alienated parent i regard parental manipulation of children of which i distressingly see an enormous amount as exceptionally harmful she wrote in her summary joanna abrahams head of family law at setfords solicitors is one of only a limited number of lawyers in the uk who specialise in cases of parental alienation she has seen a steady increase in cases in the past few years although awareness is increasing im not convinced that judges or social workers have the training and exposure that enables them to identify parental alienation and act on it she said the only real chance a victim of parental alienation has to get their child back is to find a specialist solicitor who has the expertise to ask the court to order psychological assessments directed therapy and if necessary a change of residence of the child back to the alienated parent these are expensive interventions however and cuts to legal aid mean parental alienation is something only wealthier parents are likely to have recognised she said it can cost as much as to have parental alienation properly identified the syndrome is not without controversy it is not recognised in the dms diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders or by the world health organisation in addition some campaigners maintain the syndrome is a tool used by men to seize custody of children from any mother who claims abuse paul fink president of the leadership council on child abuse and interpersonal violence has called parental alienation syndrome junk science at its worst but dr amy baker a developmental psychologist researcher and author of adult children of parental alienation syndrome breaking the ties that bind says severe parental alienation can poison a childs mind towards a previously muchloved parent in an alarmingly short period of time when children have become alienated parents who were once loved and valued seemingly overnight become objects of hatred and fear she said they appear to feel no loss over the end of the relationship with their parent and are willing to share their views of hatred without experiencing any shame or discomfort such children would likely be willing to make a false allegation of the other parent this said baker is the difference between an abused child and an alienated one children do not typically reject a parent even a relatively bad one unless they have been manipulated to do so she said children who have been maltreated are typically quite reluctant to talk about and to admit that was a parent who harmed them even once they admit the maltreatment they are still typically reluctant to reject that parent often blaming themselves for the abuse instead karen woodall a specialist in parental alienation at the family separation clinic said there is a lack of understanding in family courts professionals and in family services in general cases of severe parental alienation she said are rare but absolutely terrifying we have a system that doesnt do what needs to be done in these cases she added these cases go on for years with the children getting more and more stuck we should be applying differentiation at the start is this rejection by the child justified or not if not intensive psychological help needs to be given immediately the silver lining is that all specialists agree that children can recover very quickly with the right help and if necessary separation from the alienating parent ive seen it time and time again even with children who have refused to see their alienated parent for as many as years or made allegations of horrific sexual abuse and even cannibalism said woodall no matter what age the child is if you put them back into a normal family environment with the alienated parent they flip back to their former loving selves in an astonishingly short time miriam however is losing hope that she will ever have a meaningful relationship with her son again the criminal court dismissed the allegations of sexual assault but after having no contact with his mother during those days her son will now only consent to supervised visits in a contact centre with his mother every six weeks i have to be prepared for my exhusband to tell my son that he doesnt have to see me any more and the visits to stop said miriam my son has been so severely manipulated by his father that it may not be until he has his own children that he comes back to me but in case he hasnt come back by the time i die ive put letters and videos for him alongside my will to tell him how much and how unconditionally i love him i try to be hopeful she said but every night i go to sleep crying this article was changed on th july it originally stated that the cafcass was launching a governmentfunded therapeutic programme in fact the support it is

the moment i saw that picture of victoria beckham and her daughter harper kissing each other on the lips i thought i bet shes going to get so much flak for that and lo she has fifteen years ago i watched my cousin play with his young daughter i wasnt a mother back then they kissed each other on the lips and i remember the distinct unease that i felt why it reminded me of wet unwanted kisses from relatives but also there was something else something ill come back to later just a couple of years later i too became a parent and just as soon as she could my daughter kissed me on the lips it was natural and lovely and both my children still do this i am ever ready for them to not want to continue this practice but whenever i give them a kiss on the cheek they grab me and kiss me on the lips this is something we miss in the photo and in any debate about whats right for children it is often the child who calls the shots yes i am talking about in a healthy loving relationship and not when that relationship is dysfunctional even in comments about this yesterday people were quoted as saying things that hinted that it was beckham who instigated it or needed it or somehow thought it was best we often miss out what the child wants or thinks as if a child has no opinion at all the underlying unease lets say it is about child abuse its not a good habit to get into the bbc quoted someone as saying as if simply by responding to a kiss from your child on the lips is basically instruction for them to go kiss anyone and everyone on the lips it isnt whats not a good habit to get into is forcing your child to do something they dont want to do and yes that involves kissing or not listening to them or overriding what they want to do in simple every day ways its often the very people who will squirm at this picture who will go away and tell their children to say thank you or say sorry or kiss grandmapaunclewhomever when that children does not want to that is a far more damaging practice remember the something else i felt at my cousin kissing his daughter some people me included back then can find the intimacy between a parent and a child threatening it makes them feel left out that is what i felt in that moment i recognise it now when i hear criticism about any sort of perfectly ordinary loving behaviour between an adult and a child its really not about them

the cost of childcare in the summer holidays is now so high that some parents will have trouble paying their household bills over the coming months and will have to rely on overdrafts and credit cards to survive the sixweek break exclusive research for guardian money conducted by the financial hardship charity turnus shows that more than a third of parents are worried about the impact of the summer holidays on their ability to pay bills and expenses around say they are likely to have to rely on overdrafts loans and credit cards to get them through meanwhile a separate survey of working parents carried out by nationwide suggests that almost threequarters of couples will have to split their leave in order to look after their children three in have had to go away on holiday minus their partner with around one in regularly doing so due to work we spoke to four parents in very different circumstances around the country to see how they cope with the expense of the break rebecca clayton lives in watford with her daughter molly aged eight she works fulltime and earns and estimates the summer holidays will cost her an additional when molly started school as a single mother i was very worried about how i was going to cope with the cost of the holidays but when i told my mother how anxious i felt my parents and my younger sister each volunteered to take a weeks annual leave every year to look after molly my ex will also have her for a week and one week there will be a mix of childcare annual leave and days out with her friends then were staying with my friend in paris for a week which will cost luckily im going to be saving the a week id normally spend on childcare before and after school during termtime ill give my sister to cover mollys expenses such as taking her to london museums but my parents wont accept any money because they know i cant afford to give them any they tend to do free stuff like taking her to see her cousins or going swimming in a lake anyway im glad molly gets to spend time with her family but organising and coordinating all the logistics of everyones annual leave each year is stressful relying on family rather than paidfor childcare means there is no backup if someone falls ill or messes their dates up if they let me down at the last minute ill have to take unpaid leave that worry weighs heavily on my mind all through the year laura davies and partner scott castle live in bournemouth with their son max and have a household income of most weeks ill be looking after max during the day and working in the evening says laura i work late shifts in a bookshop while scott works parttime for tesco we deliberately organised our jobs that way so we dont have to pay for childcare after school or during the holidays one of us is always at home to look after max but it also means we dont get any time together as a family even at the weekends one of us is always at work one day over the holidays were not planning to take max anywhere that costs money were fortunate we live in bournemouth so the beach and new forest are nearby and in the summer the council puts on lots of free events for holidaymakers were relying on those events to keep our costs down well take a packed lunch so our main expense mostly will be petrol and parking that will cost between and a week i wish childcare in the summer holidays wasnt so expensive its tiring and stressful looking after a child all day and then going to work in the evening theres also no job progression if youre parttime so we havent been able to go for promotions at work i very much enjoy my time with max but it does involve a lot of juggling vicky clifton and husband mike live in leeds with their daughter molly and son darcy they both work fulltime earning nearly a year between them they reckon they will spend an extra during the summer holidays compared to their usual expenses you expect so much of your kids during the school year and you want them to go back in september refreshed and feeling like theyve had a lovely memorable summer says vicky i feel constantly guilty for working i want my children to grow up having had adventures in the school holidays so each year i plan their summer break like a military operation first i send them both to a weeklong outdoor residential summer camp where they learn things like rock climbing and bushcraft it costs us around but they absolutely love it and i can work late that week without feeling guilty then mike and i will also each take a weeks annual leave separately to be with them its hard to find free family activities to do with older children so the costs quickly add up we will probably spend around on day trips over those two weeks well also occasionally give each of them to go on a day out with their friends our family holiday will be a week in a caravan in devon which is costing its been four years since weve been able to afford a holiday abroad in the school holidays and now ive totted up what we spend during the summer im not surprised i dont know how wed manage if we couldnt rely on my mother who is to look after them for two weeks although even then keeping them entertained will cost about each year i dread paying for it all year we have to budget carefully so we can spread the cost but because we take most of our leave separately we get very little time together as a family amy edwards and husband james both live in cornwall with their sons jake and finn not their real names their household income is more than and they estimate the holidays will cost around one of the reasons i set up my own business was because it would allow me to be very flexible during the summer holidays says amy this summer ill work hours a week in the office but that comes at a price im now the primary breadwinner and my time off will cost my business in lost earnings even though ill work evenings and weekends to try to mitigate that my husband who works fulltime during the week will see my laptop more than hell see me when i work from home it is impossible when the boys are there i cant give them the attention they need they end up watching tv all day and that makes me feel awful i want them to have summers that will enrich their lives so this year for days over three weeks im sending them to holiday camps a cricket club a forest school and a drama class each costs per child per day but only runs from am to pm which gives me just five hours to work those days even then i feel guilty im not with them five days a week so ill end up spending on outings with them on my days off feeling the pinch so why are the school holidays so expensive for parents despite passionate rhetoric from politicians very little has been done to address the problem of holiday childcare says imelda redmond of the charity children for example councils are still not required to offer any subsidised childcare for schoolchildren at all during the summer holidays many parents rely on formal childcare providers like holiday clubs to look after their children but a record high number of these providers are closing their doors during the holidays redmond says those that do stay open may not accept

im and have a son of nine and a daughter of seven im happily married comfortably off everything is rosy the problem is my sons anger or rather how he deals with it he is intelligent funny and very loving he has always been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster since the toddler years but what seemed normal in a threeyearold is increasingly worrying as he gets older the basic pattern is a few months to a year of normal behaviour followed by a gradual build up of angerfrustrationtemper triggers can be the tiniest things and his reactions can be extreme these periods have generally lasted roughly one to three months before things calm down again he can say im going to kill myself which i find particularly upsetting my husband and i have tried various responses at one point dyspraxia was suggested but while he shows some of the symptoms he is great at maths has a good attention span reads voraciously and is almost a black belt he is very resistant to the idea of talking about whats happened i also sometimes feel that he uses anger as a way to avoid feeling other negative emotions such as sadness or shame his younger sister is very able and has the sunniest of dispositions although i love my son immensely and feel the two of us are very similar i sometimes feel like our lives would be perfect and happy apart from this situation that he is causing my more pressing shortterm worry is that this summer we are taking a year out to travel the world my hope is that the lack of structure and more relaxed pace and time will help him to feel calm and secure my fear is that the daily lack of consistency in our routine and of any other people to break up the family dynamic will make the situation worse not better for all of us my first impression from your longer letter was that you really care what people think i wonder if its making you put a lid on things at times family life emotions love parenting can be messy and not always how you think its going to be i got the idea that there was a collective holding of breath in your family and it is your son who exhales at regular intervals sarah sutton childpsychotherapyorguk a parent child and adolescent psychotherapist thought your drive to keep things happy may mean there are a lot of strong feelings that have to be pushed out of sight the problem is that eventually these feelings have to burst out the outburst explains sutton can feel out of proportion but it has actually built up over time your daughter sounds as if she is coping by being sunny and looking on the bright side but your son may have a particular sensitivity to emotional states and sometimes this means a child becomes a kind of lightning conductor for difficult feelings you mention dyspraxia in passing but i would like you to have another look at that dyspraxic children can be very good at complex things but really struggle with other simpler aspects of life do have a look at a column i wrote last year about a child with dyspraxia she was in fact later diagnosed there is very little about your husbands relationship with your son and we thought that was really important you are right the suicide mention is a real red flag as sutton puts it you all need support this doesnt necessarily have to be a psychotherapist it could be someone at schoola mentor in school you mention brief contact with professionals but not what the outcome was this sounds like it needs committed intervention dont be afraid please to ask for help there is no shame in it if you do decide to go down the private child psychotherapist route do look for someone via the website i mentioned at the start i asked sutton what you could do in the heat of the moment when your son was having an outburst she says it is really important to ask what could he be telling us and to name his feelings not try to pacify him but say something like youre absolutely furious right now its such a relief for children explains sutton when its ok to feel the full range of emotional states love hate disappointment contentment etc what if feelings in themselves were not right or wrong but a response to the situation someone finds themselves in part of a parents job is to help children regulate their feelings by allowing them by however unintentionally making your son feel that any of his feelings are shameful or wrong he will then have to contend with not only the feeling the outbursts but also the shame attached to them shame is a toxic emotion explains sutton no one can manage too much of it and in a desperate attempt to survive it we can find ways of getting rid of it on to other people you need to get support to help you cope with your feelings your son needs somewhere safe where he can be himself emotions within your family need to be allowed to be expressed as a natural reaction i would counsel against a trip around the world and start exploring things very much closer to home your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the

unconditional love doesnt protect against damaged broken heirs affection doesnt exclude resentment being a child doesnt always come easily whether its parental divorce death infidelity bankruptcy neglect one massive argument or a series of niggling unkindnesses a lot of us carry around a rucksack of anger towards our parents absent or otherwise i dont mean to go full larkin over here i have neither the baldness nor the bitterness but the disjunct between expectation and reality can leave us feeling that our parents have let us down that theyre failures we expected so much that what theyve delivered seems disappointing on something of a flip side my generation also seems to blame our parents baby booming success for every shortcoming dumped at our poorly hung door we cant own a house because they bought them all we cant get a job because none of them will retire theres no money left because they spent it all on holidays and haircuts we can barely breathe because they turned the air lead by driving everywhere the ocean is emptying because they wanted fish and chips for tea we cant afford healthcare because they wasted all that money on free degrees while this might be temporarily comforting and in many cases based on truth you can only milk a scapegoat so hard eventually the dugs of displaced frustration will run dry its not actually all their fault the truth is without our parents wed be little more than a spot on a gusset of course they disappointed us theyre mammals theyre idiots theyre human they had no idea what it was like to be a parent until they became one as every parenting guru tells us there is no manual for bringing up children its a case of good intentions good luck and hard work or so i hear i am not a parent i may never be one but i do have the questionable qualification of being a daughter and one who did something that i thought impossible i rebuilt a relationship with my father it wasnt a quick or particularly obvious process but in my experience the only way to have a good relationship with your spermperson is to forgive them to let it go to stop hoping theyll be anything other than precisely who they are to accept whatever they did whatever theyre doing and then make a conscious decision to stop bringing it up stop picking it apart stop telling them what they did wrong in the hope that that will make it go right in my case this involved travelling across the world just to walk up the street where he once lived to actually put myself physically in my fathers past to see where he came from and then realise where he went seeing that quiet suburban avenue in the fruit bowl of his homeland the kind of place where pretty much every meal comes with a slice of beetroot and pint of whole milk i suddenly realised not just what hed achieved but how poorly prepared hed been to do it how little of his previous life had set him up for being my father more than miles is an awfully long way to go just to put yourself in someone elses shoes but sometimes empathy is harder than it sounds part of the forgiving process as well as compassion is recognition pay attention to your similarities and you may be surprised how little the differences actually matter an easy goal in this regard is physical similarities put me in a tshirt from a builders merchant a pair of cutoff denim shorts sit me on a secondhand bike and i am basically my father with a bob that kind of samebutdifferent visual cue can open the door for more profound realisations sure they make bad decisions but arent you the one who decided to date a man who signed off his text messages with peace out of course theyre bad with money but didnt you just spend on a train ticket because you couldnt be bothered to book in advance yes theyre bad at keeping in touch but how many of your friends birthdays have you forgotten in the past year of course they dont listen but you cant remember what your partner was saying at dinner last night because you were too busy trying to line your cutlery up in size order the ocean that divides the generations is often once you roll up your trousers and wade out little more than a stream we may want to rebuild a relationship with our parents for all sorts of reasons because were getting married because theyre ill because you want more presents on your birthday because you want to make things less tense at christmas because youre going through a breakup because theyre becoming grandparents whatever the reason its worth a bash my parents luckily are wonderful people they are kind funny tolerant openminded very good at cooking rice friendly supportive and have excellent noses im incredibly lucky that theyre both still alive and living in the same country any resentment i carry around about their actions both intentional and accidental is my business not theirs and im doing my best to sort it out we can be angry at our parents for all sorts of things some of them will be their fault some of them wont but forgiving them is our responsibility no kidding,2016-07,unconditional love doesnt protect damaged broken heir affection doesnt exclude resentment child doesnt always come easily

the fact that threequarters of women experience a negative or discriminatory effect of their pregnancy at work as a report from the women and equalities select committee shows isnt a huge surprise to me seven years ago i was pregnant for the first time and emailed my employers human resources department to ask whether i would accrue bank holidays during my maternity leave its not a lifeshatteringly interesting question but something i felt i needed to know to consider how long i could afford to be at home with my newborn instead of clarification i received a sharp email instructing me that maternity leave was intended to be for recuperating from childbirth and spending time with my baby it was not a way of greedily storing up holiday chastened and naive i didnt ask again those bank holidays i was indeed entitled to disappeared into the ether and i didnt go back to that job since then as chief executive of the human rights in childbirth charity birthrights ive worked with many women facing a range of violations during or due to pregnancy and childbirth and i know how lucky i am in my case the stakes were pretty low i could just about afford not to battle but could have battled if necessary and when i realised that my muchloved job wouldnt accommodate work life and family life i was able to do something else for others maternity discrimination is more than an inconvenience it is a matter of life and death of basic survival versus thriving the committee estimates that women each year are being discouraged from attending antenatal appointments by their employers despite permanent employees having the right to time off for these crucial checkups ive seen the result of this while sitting in hospital waiting rooms sometimes for hours with women attending vital appointments for their highrisk pregnancies as the minutes tick past at the overstretched unit their slots get pushed back later and later they weigh up upsetting their employer against missing a key checkup its a choice between yours and your babys physical safety now and knowing youll have a job to go back to and can put food on the table when that bump is a squawking toddler demanding three meals a day banging the drum for the rights of pregnant women is often portrayed as an occupation for the privileged defending womens rights to choose how and where they give birth or insisting that employers make careers possible for working mothers has cleverly been placed in a box marked entitled hiding behind that label is a truth that although these issues affect all women whether they plan to have children or not it is those at the vulnerable end of the spectrum who often face the most profound consequences of having a uterus and daring to take it to work those with the fewest legal protections are casual agency and zerohours contract workers an expanding group in recent years due a scarcity of permanent jobs this is also unsurprisingly a group in which women are overrepresented these individuals often on the minimum wage can represent some of those most likely to be exposed to difficult pregnancies and births women at the lowest end of the socioeconomic spectrum face a greater risk of dying in pregnancy their babies have a higher risk of being stillborn or dying after birth and both mothers and babies stand a significantly greater chance of suffering complications insisting they can get to their midwife is no entitled plea it is a plea for basic human rights yet with the current mindset one that allows us to become complacent about the rights of those at the edge of a precipice of disadvantage the government is permitted to make woolly promises with no timeframe the media continues to report this as simply an economic problem and out come the arguments about the difficulties maternity rights pose for small business or the ideological discussions about whether women could or should have it all four out of five women experience pregnancy and whether we intend to use it or not our capacity to become pregnant sits at the root of every womans unequal treatment in society this is not a discussion that needs to stay in the boardroom without progress in pregnancy and childbirth we cannot make enough progress in womens broader rights and those made more vulnerable because of their precarious lowpaid lowstatus jobs will continue to find pregnancy a gateway to the food bank the report criticises the equalities and human rights commission for its belief that maternity discrimination is simply an issue of misinformation that can be corrected with a few wellplaced facts the echrs spokesperson asserts this is not bigger picture stuff but i like the select committee strongly disagree in the broader context of reproductive rights where the most vulnerable in society are punished at every level with lifealtering consequences maternity discrimination cannot be anything but the very biggest of big

mps are demanding urgent government action to tackle a shocking and unacceptable rise in workplace discrimination in the uk against expectant and new mothers over the last decade a report published by the women and equalities select committee called for britain to put in place protection similar to that in germany where pregnant women can only be made redundant in certain circumstances the mps also expressed concern for casual agency and zerohours workers who they said were more likely to report risks to their health and safety and more likely to leave their employer because of those risks not being resolved the government should review the maternity and pregnancy rights of this group they said the report published on wednesday recommended individual risk assessments to help reduce the number of women who left their jobs because health and safety concerns regarding pregnancy and maternity were not met the committee chair maria miller said the arrival of a new baby puts family finances under extreme pressure yet despite this thousands of expectant and new mothers have no choice but to leave their work because of concerns about the safety of their child or pregnancy discrimination shockingly this figure has almost doubled in the last decade now standing at each year there are now record numbers of women in work in the uk the economy will suffer unless employers modernise their workplace practices to ensure effective support and protection for expectant and new mums she criticised the governments response to its own findings in march which showed that pregnancy discrimination which is illegal was worse now than in the governments approach has lacked urgency and bite miller said it needs to set out a detailed plan outlining the specific actions it will take to tackle this unacceptable level of discrimination this work must be underpinned by concrete targets and changes to laws and protections to increase compliance by employers to improve womens lives currently of pregnant women and new mothers experience discrimination at work compared with years ago and lost their jobs according to the study by the department for business innovation and skills and the equality and human rights commission in march we find it shocking that the number of new and expectant mothers feeling forced out of their job has nearly doubled in the past decade the report on wednesday said it is difficult to accept the ehrcs characterisation of this as solely an issue of misinterpretation of the law the report recommended greater protections including changes in the law paid time off for antenatal appointments for all workers and a reduction in the current fee of to take a case to a tribunal which discourages those discriminated against to seek justice in germany a dismissal ban prevents redundancies for pregnant employees except in rare cases such as gross misconduct by the worker or the employer getting into severe financial difficulties resulting in multiple job losses pregnancy discrimination in the uk is present across all industries and income brackets studies have found however differences do exist for instance those on low incomes tend to face discrimination when pregnant while those on higher incomes tend to experience discrimination on their return to work a recent survey of mumsnet users found a fifth of mothers had been asked at a job interview how they would manage childcare if they got the job rosalind bragg the director of maternity action who gave evidence to the committee described the report as a roadmap to help tackle the issue implementing its recommendations could reverse the increase in discrimination and move towards a situation where pregnancy discrimination was rare she said elizabeth duff a senior policy adviser for the national childbirth trust said women in the st century should never fear making the choice between having a career and a family action to address this mistreatment is long overdue catherine rayner of the discrimination law association told the committee the rise in the number of women in casual agency and zerohours work might be one reason for the doubling of discrimination there are huge swaths of women particularly in some of the caring industries who are treated not as employees but as workers and therefore do not necessarily access the same rights the birthrights organisation said poorer women were at the greatest risk of having a stillbirth dying in childbirth or suffering complications it is vital that the law protects these women some of whom are in casual agency work or on zerohours contracts where they are unable to access protected time for vital antenatal appointments if vulnerable women cannot attend antenatal appointments because of concerns about missing work this may put them and their babies at serious risk the ehrcs deputy chair caroline waters said the commission was pleased the committee had adopted its recommendations to improve access to justice calling for an extension on the threemonth time limit for tribunal claims and tackling the barriers caused by high tribunal fees in her response to the committees report business minister margot james stressed that discrimination in the workplace is illegal james said it is completely unacceptable that pregnant women and new mothers are apparently being forced to quit their jobs because of outdated attitudes tackling this issue is a key priority of mine and this government and i would like to thank the committee for its important work we will consider its recommendations carefully and respond in due course it came as a complete shock rebecca raven was sacked from her ayear job teaching art at a private school after telling the headmistress she wanted to take maternity leave an employment tribunal later ruled that raven who was represented by the association of teachers and lecturers had been unfairly dismissed by howells school in denbigh north wales in the school was ordered to pay raven in compensation but she said that so far she hasnt seen a penny the yearold from wrexham who now runs her own business said there is discrimination law and equality law but employers are getting away with flouting it she recalls being told by one of the school trustees that they did not want to waste money on maternity pay i was very clued up i had been previously selfemployed and i knew my rights but i was made to feel like a criminal it came as a complete shock when you are pregnant you are emotional anyway but the whole thing put me under a lot of

new research from american express shows heading back to school will cost the average family with two children the equivalent of nearly six weeks worth of food shopping just to get the prescribed items from their uniform lists another survey found that british parents spend a whopping on school uniforms throughout their childs education so what can families do to cut the cost supermarkets have become the choice for parents seeking to save on school uniforms with morrisons asda sainsburys tesco and marks amp spencer all offering a range of deals however a recent study by morrisons found that four in five parents needed to replace uniforms within the same year of purchase and twothirds of school uniforms were replaced within six months social media such as facebook selling groups in your local area is a great way to grab school bargains from parents keen to declutter outgrown clothes many in fantastic condition one version of this wordofmouth selling is schoolreviewercouk a website that has a buysell feature on the page for every educational establishment listed it is in essence a captive audience of parents so sales are quicker and you save on postage which makes it a more efficient selling route than other sites such as ebay in addition a portion of proceeds from each transaction will be given to the parentteacher association of each participating school so youre saving money and helping a good cause too for parents who are really feeling the pinch there are some local authority grants available but they are patchy the govukhelpschoolclothingcosts site directs you to local councils in england that may be able to offer some help we tested various authorities east sussex and newcastle said there were no grants but york said it had vouchers worth to available to those entitled to free school meals while the city of london said it had grants worth up to separate arrangements apply in northern ireland scotland and wales northern irish education authorities offer parents whose children qualify for free school meals at primary age and once they are at secondary school wales offers up to to those on free school meals its morrisons for us matt hazeldine a father of three lives in tarvin cheshire with his wife michelle his yearold son cayden is starting at tarporley high school he spends at morrisons for the core items and for the school logo items we have three boys five and so all of school age which means going back to school can be a very expensive time of year its essential that we keep costs down where possible but without reducing the quality its easier than it used to be now that supermarkets like morrisons do good value clothes for caydens start at his new school weve got to get grey trousers pale blue shirts a navy jumper and black shoes the school isnt strict on where we get these from so we can go to the supermarket but we do get the school blazer pe shirts and pe shorts from the school shop as they have to be emblazoned with the school logo the main restrictions on what they cant wear to school are skinny jeans and designer canvas shoes like vans we have to have clothes that will last the wear and tear of the schoolyard weve had problems where the price has been reasonable but the durability has let us down which meant costly and regular replacements the school sent a very strict list linda greenwood mum of one is a civil servant and lives in redcar north yorkshire her yearold son charlie will be attending rye hills school she spends about buying charlies school uniform used to be pretty easy when he was younger he starts secondary school this september and its been far from easy and much more expensive the school sent us a very specific and strict list of what we had to buy and there was no deviating from it ive easily spent upwards of so far ive paid for pe kit and for a tie and blazer and for the trainers football boots shin pads and black shoes itll be around ive bought six white shirts x packs from tesco phew and five pairs of black trousers which have been a problem charlies very tall and into boys age or mens medium there is one style he likes from next but they only go up to a yearold size so next year im going to struggle the school have a contract with a local shop and they supply all the embroidered uniforms its quite the monopoly i wish the school would let us choose where we buy the items and take them to be embroidered my children are at private schools sue lemmer lives in cobham surrey and has three children including yearold evie at notre dame school in cobham and yearold alfie at seaford college west sussex she can spend upwards of per child for uniforms and sports kit my eldest son left reeds school in cobham last year and the setup with regards to uniform was ideal with a school shop on site i could pop in or make an appointment or even set an account limit which allowed my son to get things himself at any time food or uniform with an online stock list complimenting this its a totally different story for evie and alfie their costs have been astronomical with their blazers costing a piece now maybe isnt too much if the quality will last everyday usage and it doesnt have to be replaced yearly but i fear that wont be the case and itll be an annual expenditure for us all their uniform has been overpriced with a white girls shirt being at age in marks amp spencer you can get three for that price so it shows the school is looking to make quite a hefty profit every year it sets me back around to kit them out at the start especially as they are all growing and then they need another on sports gear on top of this so it adds up very quickly their uniform costs more than normal because it has the school logo printed on all items and it often has names sewn into them ideally i would love all schools to have a school shop on site especially if their uniform is lost or taken it makes the experience easier and cuts out the stress of waiting on deliveries and clothes fitting the benefit to having a shop is that labels can be printed on site and done while you wait it saves having to iron on tags alfies uniform isnt so simple to get you have to book to go to london for a fitting or everything has to be done online annoyingly sizes never seem to be accurate so sometimes half the uniform has to be sent back its very hit and miss especially with sport kits every sport has a different kit cricket rugby hockey or netball so with the kids all playing sport they need astros and relevant boots or trainers for these sports

once upon a time there were two parents living in domestic disharmony kept together probably by their adored and indulged son the mother died and after a few years i came on the scene and married this father of the oneandonly son the son and i got on well for a few years i then discovered that his father despite the son now being over paid a monthly sum to cover the sons psychologists bill it was admitted that the money was not actually being used for this purpose i then learned that despite having no responsibilities the son had debts that ran into a comfortable fourfigure sum even though he earned a large salary he was also propped up by his dad when it came to paying income tax the mindset behind this was his belief that he was entitled to his mothers money even though her will had bequeathed it to his father and his father had made it clear that the son would be his sole beneficiary i was able to show that none of my four children by a previous marriage had any dependence on me nor had expectations of inheritance such matters were never discussed my husband took my point that propping up his son was counterproductive enhancing his dependence on his dad he stopped his monthly payments for the fictional psychologist and suggested the next income tax handout be a loan which was not honoured i am therefore vilified as responsible for having influenced my husband against his son when we are together my stepson is covertly rude to me by engaging his father in conversations in which i can have no input but has also been overtly rude in shouting at me that i was living off his father and responsible for his mothers death there is no logical way in which i can be implicated i believe the three of us should have an easy unselfconscious companionship accepting eachs relationship with the other i know that my husbands view is the same i think my stepson would ideally like to turn back the pages push me over a cliff and resume milking his father dry he is in a state of confused jealousy about his father remarrying how can i improve our relationship sometimes when people want love but feel they dont have it they want money instead and often when family members disagree they have more in common than they realise your stepson does sound quite disagreeable in parts but why does it irk you so much that he iswas so indulged by his parents werent you by yours i found the sideswipe at your husbands first wife unnecessary and callous if you are like this in real life with the son im not surprised he is grasping at what he can from his father and where is his father exactly in all this leaving you two to fight like siblings i consulted a psychologist emma kenny bacpcouk she says while it would be easy to respond sympathetically by agreeing that the son is indeed a freeloader who sees his father as a cash cow i believe that would do both of you a disservice it would only compound the already clear hostility families often have different approaches to money and inheritance some are adamant their children should get by on their own others see leaving a monetary legacy as an act of love one of the main issues says kenny seems to be your concern about money you suggest he resents his inheritance being spent and give as an example your own children as being financially independent this demonstrates the unhealthy competition you are creating on all sides youve decided your children are more capable successful and welladjusted than your husbands you suggest that your own kids dont expect a penny in inheritance how do you know youve never discussed it you cant marry into a family and expect the children to have been parented as yours were one way isnt right for everyone and as kenny points out your stepsons mother may have indulged her son and may well not have agreed with the parenting style that you feel is correct potentially this man grew up feeling cherished and important and when his mother died looked to his father to continue this emotional and financial bond kenny also feels that it is his father who has allowed this bailing out to continue and that the son may view it as a physical manifestation of love of course he could be a total and terrible freeloader but that is for his father to deal with i wonder if you feel massive resentment towards your husband but its safer to project this on to your stepson stop making your stepson feel like a failure stop acting like a detective and allow your husband to make the decisions he wishes to about his son says kenny sit down as a family and agree to allow their relationship to progress as they see fit draw a line under your previous issues and agree to move on more positively stop trying to control your husband and accept that there is room for him to love both of you finally you are suggesting that money shouldnt be so important to your stepson maybe you could lead by example your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the guardian kings

i didnt plan to get pregnant i was my daughters father and i were not together it was seemingly not the best situation except that it really was having a child our child with him in exactly that way has led to a fabulous life a brilliant coparenting situation and more love than i could have ever imagined what made it that way was a choice by both of us to imagine a positive future we created a document that turned our vision into a template a contract and a philosophy for how to live our coparenting agreement its a parenting prenup how a parenting prenup works my daughter cecilia is now six years old and has the best of all worlds her dad and i live three blocks apart by design we are friends and more importantly we are good coparents we spent fourandahalf months creating an agreement while i was pregnant in addition to our regular jobs we worked together to create a page legal and philosophical agreement about how to raise our daughter together the document outlines custody and residential schedule and also covers every other aspect of parenting and our daughters life education joint parenting decisions travel communication living abroad we outline how we share a calendar of events and make rules we agree on an approach to spiritual upbringing we even covered her gap year after high school it was originally his idea it took a lot of work and it is brilliant first we share responsibility and time equally cecilia is with me of the time and with her dad of the time on average it varies by a few percent from year to year that started when she was eight months old in the beginning i pumped extra milk and he made his own formula and we muddled through the emotions and logistics of it we had already studied attachment parenting and built provisions into the agreement to cover needier times but by the time cecilia was a year old wed found a rhythm and by the time she was two it was glorious for me this part of the agreement required clearing out a lot of archaic and ridiculous beliefs around the role of fathers i had to accept that a father could be as good a parent to a baby and a child as a mother i had to trust him to be that and i had to let go he has been a fantastic parent since day one when cecilia was two and a half i went to africa for days what mom of a twoandahalfyearold gets to do that and how many dads get the joy of having a twoandahalfyearold solo for that length of time because i was able to clear out my old frankly sexist ideas we all benefitted and i have freedom to enjoy my life we looked at what really matters to uscecilias father included a provision that he always wants to be with her on opening day of baseball season i added a provision that i want her to be with me for an annual religious festival we wrote a clause about our wishes around breastfeeding we both value that and we created a clause around nutrition limiting the amount of sugar she ate until she was three by working through this early we ironed out the potential points of conflict in our parenting long before they arose these seem like small things but are true reflections of what we each and both care about they are the things we wanted to make sure we agreed on a few provisions turned out to be a little stiff as it turns out i do not always want to have her for the whole mothers day every year im quite happy to have a leisurely brunch and share time with her grandma that day but i only learned that over time and we loosen as we go by working through this exercise early we ironed out the potential points of conflict in our parenting long before they arose we dont disagree because we already talked about it we took financial questions out of the picture we use splitwise to track and reconcile expenses again his idea and we make payments approximately every three months having a shared tracking system ensures that we are evenly splitting expenses and have complete transparency around what those expenses are for us shared expenses include her medical insurance babysitter bills for school holidays and school fees shared expenses do not include birthday parties most toys or shoes and clothing her granny does most of the shopping we are lucky that way we agreed from the beginning that neither of us regardless of who earns more will pay the other child support things can never devolve into a squabble about money because there is no money exchanged his money is his my money is mine we each fund cecilias life when money is pulled as a lever it is a lever that offers rewards it gives us freedom ease and a sense of fairness and it gives cecilia peaceful parents who focus on our weekend swimming plans with her rather than who should pay for what i get to live the life i created six and a half years later i can honestly say that i love and admire cecilias dad i also love and admire his girlfriend because she improves his life and is great to our daughter coparenting is wonderful when my daughter is with me i give her dedicated time and attention when she is with her dad i trust that shes taken care of and go off to happily work and play i have the best of all worlds and the most important part cecilia does too she is cared for and respected in an atmosphere of peace and calm by parents who create that for each other,2016-08,didnt plan get pregnant wa daughter father together wa seemingly best

the pay gap between men and women widens markedly in the wake of maternity leave according to new research by the institute for fiscal studies women earn less than men on average but years after the birth of a first child that grows to the fawcett society a womens rights campaign group said the figures showed that the economy was wasting womens skills and experience by not producing enough quality parttime jobs here seven women talk about their experiences of returning to work as a mother and how it affected their career julia from yorkshire now i just see my work as a job not a career job physiotherapist while i was pregnant with my child there was a big restructure at work and a lot of jobs were at risk of going but new positions also became available i was offered one of the new senior positions when i was on maternity leave and they said that me having a baby would not put me at a disadvantage but when i came back to sort out my contract i realised that it would be harder than i anticipated i felt they were completely inflexible about my working hours the contract they offered me was on a fulltime basis but i wanted to return parttime so i didnt have to put my child in fulltime childcare i offered to work weekends instead as the service runs sevendaysa week but they didnt allow this i felt really upset i had worked hard in my old role and felt this wasnt being recognised it seemed to me that as soon as they realised i couldnt do the hours they wanted they didnt want me anymore i was frustrated because i knew i could do just as good a job parttime also i could have done a lot of the admin work from home but they didnt want me working off site eventually i had to take a parttime job at a lower banding reducing my annual pay by thousands its affected my career and i am working at a lower level than i was before maternity leave ive seen a few more senior jobs come up but dont want to apply as i know they wont be flexible on hours now i just see my work as a means to pay the bills rather than a career i can progress in tanya from scotland i know my pay lags behind that of male colleagues its souldestroying job senior manager it i know that my pay is lagging behind others ive seen male colleagues get regular pay rises and i now earn a mere more than some of them despite being one of the longestserving members of staff its soul destroying this is partly because i had a child but also because i am not as pushy as some of the men i work with after maternity leave i had to really fight to come back part time i had to make a representation to the board and explain why it was doable i was even put on a trial period where my work was monitored closely my job now hasnt changed i just have to do it with one extra day i work four days a week and spend my day off with my child checking my phone all day i cannot afford to go back up to working five days a week because of the cost of childcare within two weeks of being back at work after having a baby i was told you cant expect to have kids and make any progress in your career i was shocked if theres a problem for example my child is ill they arent very understanding i have been told dogs are a better option than children the situation is dreadful in my industry once youre out on maternity leave its very hard to get back in again many of my female friends have never gone back to work melody from the northwest i have been well supported by my team and manager since having a baby job scientist in aerospace and defence i have been told in the past that i earn more than most of my colleagues i am interested to find out more about the pay gap in my company when they publish the figures next year in my current job i am one of two women out of employees and the sole female scientist none of my colleagues have ever been sexist to me and i am never afraid to ask for help if i cannot manage something i have been well supported by my team and manager since having a baby i have no interest in getting promoted but i have been given new roles within my area and new tasks that might one day lead to a promotion mothers who return to work should be given hours free childcare whatever the age of the child otherwise given the high cost of childcare its almost not worth coming back we spent about half of our income on it including childcare vouchers if i could have free hours now i would be much less stressed about my familys finances caitlin from the north my company refused to give me maternity pay job tech ive worked for companies where pay rates were not discussed or published and i was aware anecdotally that male colleagues at the same level were earning more i also worked with a senior manager who only ever promoted male colleagues to management posts including when there were numerous female colleagues that could have been promoted many better qualified instead my company refused to give me maternity pay when i had a baby legally this was within their right as i was pregnant when i joined the company but i actually didnt know at the time it was only by a few weeks i was lucky i could claim maternity allowance and get extra financial support from my partner i let my boss know i wouldnt be returning to the company after six months maternity leave which he seemed surprised at i dont know why this came as a shock after they had chosen not to invest in my future at the company i took on a parttime contract role when my son was nine months and the company was very understanding and accommodating of my situation however in reality this was a fivedayaweek role being squeezed into three days and i struggled with it ive now decided to move on and look to set up my own business so i can be in control of my time we need to move away from the idea that organisations are losing money when their staff go on maternity leave companies should see employees as a longterm investment if someone is treated well then they will want to stay at the organisation for longer women are also put under enormous pressure from both sides to either have it all work and be a mum or to not go back to work and neglect their child women struggle daily with knowing what the right thing is to do many wont financially have the choice either way but many feel guilty for wanting a career ally from southampton after i had a baby i wasnt offered the sexy projects that get you promoted job civil servant im very lucky that working in the public sector means that pay is very transparent and there is no difference at my level in what men and women are paid there is a motherhood penalty however i was not offered the highprofile sexy projects which get you noticed and promoted because i needed to leave the office at pm to get home for my child there was also an assumption that i would go off and have a second child so i was given work to tide me over until that day came i was eventually so bored at work i did decide it was a good time to have a second child my prospects of promotion are diminished now i have children and want to get home to my family we need more flexible working just because we dont want to work late it doesnt mean we are not making a positive contribution winnie from surrey since my husband left i am even less able to go for promotions job teacher there doesnt appear to be a gender pay gap in teaching but men hold more positions of authority and dont work parttime to raise their children this means they can access fulltime roles more easily i had a child with additional needs and the onsite nursery wouldnt take him so i had to give up my job as a further education lecturer i am unable to work as a proper teacher as there is no childcare for children with additional needs in my area to help me outside of school hours since my husband left i now have no support and am even less able to go for promotions i have tried but been rejected because i would need to work from home jasmine midlands im able to fit the work around my children not the other way around job architect in my career i studied alongside men and progressed at the same time as them my experience was that i was paid the same based on my ability and experience i was never discriminated against my employers were also incredibly supportive in offering me flexible working when i had a baby i know that my pay and position would have continued to be based on my ability to do the job i have since found ways of working part time from home meaning i dont have to leave my children or pay for childcare im able to fit the work around my children not the other way around obviously some jobs dont allow this but more could be done to facilitate it all names have been changed,2016-08,pay gap men woman widens

women earn less than men on average according to new research that highlights the challenge facing theresa may in closing britains stubbornly wide gender pay gap the institute for fiscal studies ifs also found that the gap balloons after women have children raising the prospect that mothers are missing out on pay rises and promotions that is echoed by a separate report on tuesday suggesting that male managers are more likely than female managers to be promoted may highlighted the gulf between mens and womens earnings in her first statement as prime minister when she vowed to create a britain that works for everyone but underscoring the struggle her government will face in closing the gender pay gap the ifs study hints at an entrenched penalty for those women who have children the pay gap widens consistently for years after a first child is born by which point women receive less pay an hour than men according to the research funded by the joseph rowntree foundation more than four decades after the equal pay act there is some encouraging news in the report the current gap in hourly wages is down from in and in the ifs notes but at the same time its research reveals there has been little improvement for graduates and women with alevels for the midlevel and highly educated the gender wage gap is essentially the same as it was years ago the gap between the hourly pay of highereducated men and women has not closed at all in the last years said robert joyce associate director at ifs and one of the reports authors the reduction in the overall gender wage gap has been the result of more women becoming highly educated and a decline in the wage gap among the lowesteducated the thinktank says the widening of the hourly wage gap after childbirth is associated with working fewer hours however women do not see an immediate cut in hourly pay when they reduce their hours rather women who work hours or less per week lose out on subsequent pay rises meaning that the hourly wages of colleagues in fulltime work pull further and further ahead sam smethers chief executive at the fawcett campaign group said the findings underlined the urgent need for more quality parttime jobs we are wasting womens skills and experience because of the way we choose to structure our labour market she said parttime workers can be the most productive yet reduced hours working becomes a career culdesac for women from which they cant recover but mark littlewood director general at the free market thinktank the institute of economic affairs said the study showed employer discrimination was not to blame for the gender pay gap if anything the ifs has provided us with more evidence that the wage gap has nothing to do with gender discrimination as the study itself notes women who take time off work and return doing fewer hours are not getting paid less per hour former prime minister david cameron had vowed to end the gender pay gap in a generation and new government rules are coming in next april that will force bigger employers to publish their pay gap the uk has also introduced more free childcare and shared parental leave but equality campaigners are concerned too few families can afford for fathers to take it responding to the ifs study a government spokeswoman said we want to make our country a place where there is no limit on anyones ambition or what they can achieve that means making sure everyone regardless of their gender can succeed at work the gender pay gap is the lowest on record but we know we need to make more progress and faster thats why we are pushing ahead with plans to force businesses to publish their gender pay and gender bonus gap a separate report from the chartered management institute cmi attempts to shed some light on womens lack of pay progression by analysing the salary data of more than uk managers and professionals in the past year of men in management roles were promoted into higher positions compared with of women the research carried out with pay analysts xperthr cited the difference in promotion rates as one of the main causes of the gender pay gap the cmis measure of the pay gap for managers was for this year compared with in cmis chief executive ann francke said the rules on reporting pay gaps should force employers to analyse any discrepancies in the salaries of male and female employees promoting men ahead of women is keeping us all back she said diversity delivers better financial results better culture and better decision making transparency and targets are what we need to deal with stubborn problems like the gender pay gap the researchers also found there were fewer women in executive positions than men women comprise of the workforce in entry and junior level roles but female representation drops to at senior management level and at director level mark crail content director at xperthr commented the gender pay gap is not primarily about men and women being paid differently for doing the same job its much more about men being present in greater numbers than women the higher up the organisation you go,2016-08,woman earn less men average according new research

new mothers are facing increasing discrimination when they take maternity leave including being made redundant and switched to zerohours contracts citizens advice has recorded a nearly rise in the number of women seeking advice about maternity leave issues this year just over came to the charity with such issues in the year to june compared to last year the surge in reported problems has emerged after the guardian revealed that sports direct workers returning from maternity leave are claiming they were moved on to zerohours contracts the claims were made in court documents relating to a breachofcontract case in which workers say they were excluded from the retailers generous bonus scheme citizens advice says the introduction of fees for employment tribunals through which workers can challenge poor treatment has combined with the rise of zerohours contracts agency work and multiple parttime jobs to make employees more vulnerable to sharp practice on maternity rights legally women are protected from losing their job having their hours changed or their responsibility reduced as a result of pregnancy while employment and sex discrimination legislation offers protection responsibility for enforcing such employment rights is spread across a wide range of agencies from hmrc to the gangmasters and labour abuse authority said gillian guy chief executive of citizens advice this confusing landscape means some bad bosses are getting away with treating their employees unfairly guy said there is an opportunity for the government to consider bringing together the expertise of all current labour market enforcement functions into one wellresourced effective body to investigate bad practice citizens advice said the most common issue it dealt with in relation to maternity leave was being made redundant followed by a reduction in hours including being moved to a zerohours contract and having a role changed upon return to work a report into the issue released by citizens advice this week highlights the case of nadia who worked as a head chef in a local pub on a permanent contract when she had difficulties during her pregnancy that meant she could no longer work in the kitchen she was offered work as a waitress on a zerohours contract another woman who works for a national retail chain told the guardian she had her hours cut from about a week to during her pregnancy after she arrived late for work on one occasion they said it was for my safety but that didnt make sense i was fine she said although she worked regular hours on the shop floor she was employed on a zerohours contract basis and found it hard to ensure she received any maternity pay now back at work she feels under pressure to work even when her child is ill or she has given several weeks notice that she needs time off because of difficulties in finding childcare i dont really feel secure sometimes it feels like i have to go in or they will reduce my hours to nothing or i will lose my job its always at the back of my mind when my daughter is not very well the research by citizens advice supports the findings of a report by the equality and human rights commission into maternity discrimination published last year the study estimated that around new mothers are losing their jobs across britain every year almost twice the number identified in similar research undertaken in it also found that of women were discouraged from attending antenatal appointments by their employers putting the health of mother and baby at risk,2016-08,new mother facing increasing

when i discovered the bechdel test created by graphic novelist alison bechdel in her comic dykes to watch out for i found it a revelation the bechdel test is an irresistibly simple gauge of female representation and gender inequality in film to pass a film has to have two named female characters who talk to each other about something other than a man the test has been applied to plays too as with the twitter campaign bechdeltheatre but although the test is useful i worry when it is the only thing used to measure the feminism of a film or a play a use bechdel never intended the ridiculously retrograde twilight for example passes doormat heroine bella talks briefly to her mother about moving to a new town while gravity which has a fierce clever and interesting heroine fails sometimes womens conversations about men are feminist two women discussing being bullied at work by a man would make for a feminist drama certainly preferable to a play in which two women briefly compared shoes but spent the rest of the time serving the narrative arcs of the men id go further conversations about fancying or loving or sleeping with men can be feminist too i dont believe it is unfeminist to ask how we can have relationships with men because some of us do want to to ask what makes a man a feminist and what we can expect from men to ponder how we can achieve equality in our romantic lives as i wrote my play how to date a feminist i knew it would fail the bechdel test because these questions are its major concerns so i wanted to think about other ways of challenging myself to make feminist theatre the ongoing inequality according to the latest research women are only playing of stage roles in the uk writing of the plays and directing of them inspired the sphinx test a series of questions for playwrights to consider questions such as is there a woman centre stage is she active rather than reactive is she compelling and complex ive asked myself other questions too how many of the cast are women and what percentage of the dialogue do they speak do the female characters have agency do they make choices do they drive their own stories or indeed their cars do they have a strong arc are they victims or do they have power or seize power do their stories empower them or punish them does the play address issues of concern to women and to feminists does the play support the status quo or does it invite the audience to imagine to think to make change if the play is funny do the women have any funny lines one particular bugbear of mine is comic plays where the men monopolise the wit and the women are earnest heartfelt or worst of all longsuffering i was determined not to reinforce the madly outdated idea that feminism cant be funny so i hope my play passes this test at least the questions dont stop once a play goes into production in fact a director can make a huge difference by reinterpreting a play through a feminist lens or casting genderblind other questions to ask might be how many of the creative team are women are they respected in rehearsal are the actors asked to wear costumes that make them feel uncomfortable the casting call woe blog now an edinburgh show is a rollcall of failures on this front and how is the play marketed more than one producer asked if i could call my play something that didnt involve the word feminist which they felt was too inyourface too political or too boringsounding in the end keeping the title felt like a feminist statement i could make before the lights even went up on the first scene how to

sex workers are at greater risk of violence and ill health due to substantial cuts to specialist nhs health and support services across the uk according to experts service providers and rights groups an editorial in the british medical journal published this week warned of avoidable harms and disastrous longterm costs of ongoing funding cuts to services available to sex workers in the uk specialist nhsfunded services have so far controlled outbreaks of hiv syphilis and tuberculosis among sex workers and outreach programmes have halved the risk of them contracting sexually transmitted infections according to the editorials coauthors researchers from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine an estimated sex workers use such services according to national ugly mugs a group that works to improve the safety of sex workersalex feisbryce the chief executive officer of num said the generic funding cuts are very concerning and the impacts are huge to expect them to access generic services is unrealistic we know that sex workers are targeted by violent offenders without services to protect and to support them when they are victims offenders will get away with it georgina perry a former manager at open doors a longestablished and well regarded nhs service for sex workers in east london said the services funding was being cut by she resigned last week over the cuts and her concerns that a new funding model set up by hackney council compromised patient confidentiality at one point we had individuals out of living with tbhiv coinfection says perry these are really terrible statistics when we first started with our street sex workers virtually of them were homeless they didnt have gps and they were using aampe as their primary care i feel really sad that we are going to go back a decade or more because we will her resignation she said came after open doors was asked to share confidential client information at street users outreach meeting suom meetings in hackney also attended by police and immigration officers perry said i cant work for a service if i am being forced to give peoples information to the police it is a principle in the nhs that you dont breach peoples confidence a spokesman for hackney council said while we are disappointed that a manager at the open doors service has recently resigned both hackney council and homerton hospital are committed to continuing the open doors service and providing appropriate health and sexual healthcare for sex workers teela sanders professor of criminology at leicester university said cuts were happening at a time when the sex industry is growing specialist services are just going to be focussed on large cities which doesnt really reflect what is happening in the sex work community where there is real growth of people working online if you cut a service there are ramifications for health for safety and for protection sanders who worked as a researcher with support services for sex workers in manchester leeds and birmingham for years said over the last years the commissioning of sexual support services have been reduced and merged with other services in the safe project in birmingham had eight staff now it has twoandahalf meanwhile there has been a ballooning and diversifying of the sex industry she said reduced funding meant many services would only offer support to the most chaotic groups such as street sex workers and drug users leaving other workers for instance migrant sex workers vulnerable nine of the last murders of sex workers have been migrant workers she said this is the extreme end of what happens when these women are not hooked into services case study stacey a former street sex worker who was addicted to crack cocaine for years told the guardian how open doors helped her turn her life and the lives of her children around she said the moment i walked in i felt so relaxed nobody judged me within hours they found me a hostel they sorted out my housing benefit my gp and my mental health i didnt even have a clean pair of knickers they gave me underwear they gave me a toothbrush open doors broke the chain the staff nurtured me loved me and guided me they taught us new ways to live they took us out and bought us ice cream it felt like the family i never had then little by little without you even noticing they will take steps back and then you realise that you are capable you can be independent but if you need them they are there my son wanted to go and start taking drugs my daughter had stopped going to school but once i started going to open doors i changed their lives now i have a flat my daughter lives with me my son with his dad my son just got six a gsces three of them as he is looking to go to cambridge he has already been selected as gifted and talented my daughter works fulltime as a barista i have seen mothers and daughters on the street together one on one corner one on the other it is so sad i have been raped ive been beaten and i have been held at gunpoint i am surprised i am still alive and to think my daughter couldve been doing that too open doors gave me the chance to carry on and enjoy the rest of my life i will see my son graduate see my daughter hopefully get promoted to become manager this government doesnt know what its doing open doors saves lives it shouldnt be cut if i was to win the

some really great debate below the line today thanks to everyone who has taken part and please to share suggestions for how this format can be made better a form awaits your views here finally please enjoy this photo of a dog sleeping in the sun shared as part of our witness asking for your pictures in the sun hope everyone will shortly be out and about in it great weekends everyone clare longrigg deputy editor of the guardians long read section talks about one of her commissions lauren wolfe is an american writer who does a lot of work on womens rights she came to us in november with a pitch for a story about children from a very poor village in eastern congo who were being systematically abducted and raped and the authorities seemed incapable of stopping it clearly it was a story that needed to be told plus she had funding to go to the drc which obviously helped we spoke and emailed frequently over the following months as she visited the drc to do the main part of her reporting talking to the little girls and their families to doctors and to investigators about the corruption they were up against traumatic as the story was to report it became even more stressful for lauren once she was back in the us as she tried to establish what she could make public without endangering her sources there was also a long delay before the suspects were arrested which was a real problem for us since if there were no arrests we couldnt publish worse if there were no arrests it would mean that the suspects were under protection so the attacks would continue in may lauren decided to move things on by writing an opinion piece for the guardian pointing out the scandalous lack of action the following morning at am new york time she received an email saying the suspects were under arrest the challenge in editing a piece like this is to pull together a mass of reporting and try to hammer a confusing set of events into a coherent chronological narrative that reads like a detective story but brings out the humanity of the victims and gives the reader a powerful sense of what it is like to be on the ground trying to stop these horrendous crimes against a wall of indifference the piece we finally produced was a harrowing read but the heartfelt response on twitter immediately reinforced our view that it was a story that had to be told youll see lots of people complaining on social media about restrictions around covering the olympics this year unless youve paid a squillion dollars for the rights to broadcast it the ioc are extremely unhappy with people using clips on social media including the humble gif and the use of vine this can be pretty frustrating especially when one of the most enjoyable bits of watching sport on the second screen can be trying to spot the funny little things that go on in the background still it is a lot easier than it used to be the fuss reminded me of when i was working on coverage of the athens olympics back in those days if you wanted to link to the official olympics site they requested that you write to the internet department in greece in advance to let them know some interesting views being expressed so far full story is here social video is really a very broad term so we try to keep three words in mind when looking for stories and then designing videos around them smart personal shareable smart means you learn or understand something without feeling lectured or overwhelmed personal means youre engaged because theres a familiar emotion or situation even in a subject thats completely new or that youd usually ignore shareable means the first two things were true and you want that to be a collective experience the design and pace of visuals and audio are also key to keeping your attention not giving you a second to think about clicking away this week these two videos worked for me great debate going on below the line around this topic readers below the line have been engaging with martin belams post below on twitter and the fact people this week have been using savetwitter after rumours suggested we may soon see the end of the social media platform here are two very different views on this dave schilling is a guardian us writeratlarge he wrote this week about suicide squad drawing comparisons to the film con air here he talks about the reaction he got from readers it would be disingenuous of me to say that i was expecting a vociferous defence of the action film con air directed by simon west and starring that guy from the not the bees meme a commenter named fearandchaos said enough of the con airophobia please fridaywaits really went in on me and listed off a few other classics stopped reading when you tried to argue con air isnt a top top film what are you going to have a pop at next bad boys the rock i feel a certain misunderstanding here con air is a perfectly fun film but its not high art what separates it from a film like suicide squad is that it is an unabashed bmovie outside of the work of vin diesel hollywood doesnt make lowbrow silly action fare any more nicolas cage is partly to blame for this as his turn in the rock started the trend of celebrated actors taking on schlock parts to class up a genre film now michael fassbender can star in a video game adaptation the blurring of the line between high and low art has rendered everything an amorphous mass of bland mush fast cant get here soon enough its almost never sunny it seems and this summer has seen its far share of rain so far so because the sun is out today and we want to savour it send us a photo of you enjoying the great outdoors we will publish our favourites above the line lots of interesting discussion below the line about this that i would like to highlight theres clearly two very distinct views encourage more discussion below the line tash reithbanks is production editor for science she also writes about theatre books and music and can be found on twitter tashreithbanks not since jaws has summer featured this much excitement about a shark we knew that greenland sharks are quite longlived but theres never been a way to properly determine their age not only do scientists think theyve finally cracked it they also discovered that one of the sharks measured was around years old making it the oldest vertebrate animal keen sharkspotters dont need to go all the way to greenland however august is peak basking shark season off scotlands west coast if sharks dont float your boat weve had great news this week from the walk again project a team of scientists hoping to give paraplegic patients more independence found that their experimental rehabilitation regime unexpectedly gave trial participants partial recovery of movement and sensation northern hemisphere stargazers should keep an eye on the skies as although the perseid shower reached its peak last night hopefully there will still be meteors to be seen over the weekend we send out a roundup lab notes every friday with all of the weeks biggest science stories plus the best pieces from our expert bloggers so if you fancy keeping up to date you can sign up to the email here the savetwitter hashtag was trending this week as users got themselves worked up about a hoax that the service would be shut down next year it wont but the social media frenzy generated some tweets where people seemed worried about the prospect some tweets from people that definitely werent and a whole mess of confusion years hanging out below the line here on the guardian have taught me that quite a few of you would be very happy to see twitter and the stories it generates disappear and those people will be pleased to see their enthusiasm reflected in a petition to save the service generating all of people in agreement im endlessly fascinated by how social media hoaxes grow online though and if you are too youll probably enjoy this piece from my colleague elena cresci about the marina joyce kidnap conspiracy theory and no it doesnt matter if you havent heard of her before its an enjoyable glimpse into a world where some random people on the internet deciding that something bad must be happening to you can be enough to have the police knocking on your door ever notice that cool places all look the same last week writer kyle chayka explored this phenomenon in an essay in the verge describing the way techled travel is homogenising what we consider to be the desirable hallmarks of any given destination everywhere you go seemingly hip unique spaces have a way of looking the same whether its bars or restaurants fashion boutiques or shared office spaces he wrote in a followup piece for the guardian describing its key features as reclaimed wood edison bulbs and refurbished industrial lighting chayka dubs this style airspace its function making a particularly elite demographic of global travellers feel comfortable and at home as they skip from city to city booking apartments on airbnb checking into the local coworking hub and meeting up with fellow digital nomads for an ideas jam or whatever at the nearest coffee joint its a subject ive thought about a lot in the past travelling to different cities for guardian travel while chayka focuses on the aesthetic of airspace and the way it has been driven by a group of people who move through spaces linked by technology ive always thought more about how the people themselves could be defined hipsters doesnt seem to cut it nor are these simply the upper classes i think it goes beyond the silicon valley kids too a particular class is emerging in the world who arent bound by location and places particularly cities are evolving rapidly to accommodate them and their collective tastes airspace is a good first step in opening up a critical discussion about who these people are this week we enjoyed the discussion beneath ellie mae ohagans article on corbyn supporters she argued that the labour leaders followers are aware of his failings but he represents a set of values that have been marginalised in politics and which are worth fighting for in response you said this kipwar good article in particular this comment but i have zero sympathy with those in the party who have been utterly unwilling to engage with corbyn supporters i feel one of the many reasons so many people are up in arms on this forum is the fact that eaglesmith supporters are just assuming everyone who supports corbyn is a stone cold hard lefter they really need to sit down and reflect on why they are losing voters and not just since corbyn scotland and the north are abandoning labour in droves not because of corbyn but because of how labour has acted prior to this pretty much the entirety of labour in scotland being wiped out was because of his predecessors not him this coup has done nothing positive robin wilde i know a couple of decent corbynites but when they dont show up to canvassing and only turn up at meetings when its to shout down and roll their eyes at anyone more moderate and then spend their days leaping on everyone on twitter calling me a red tory blairite scum on the far right for gods sake what are we supposed to think of them if were dismissive or angry or hurt in response to them its not because we hate them personally its out of frustration and deep lasting despair i have lost sleep over the past few weeks because of the fact that ive lost good labour friends over the fact that i dont think the current leaders very good the partys hurtling off a cliff and it doesnt make it any better that its all smiles on the way down queequeg most of us who support corbyn do so without any illusions we simply want a party which reflects our opinions and beliefs which puts equality and fairness before austerity which builds homes and an nhs for everyone which gets rid of tuition fees and tax havens which put peace and principle before arms sales which puts the environment before exploitation which puts rights before wrongs labour and tory have been interchangeable since blair and look where its got us corbyn breaks with the consensus and thats whats needed thats why we support him obviously it helps that hes a truthful kind decent person but its the politics stupid food the one website guaranteed to make you hungry no matter the hour has just published another of its genius recipes under the headline ruth reichls grilled cheese is genius and completely out of control i clicked because i mean of course i clicked its grilled cheese one clicks but also i was intrigued to see if reichl could better what is ostensibly according to every single person ive met whos eaten one the worlds greatest grilled cheese bill oglethorpes borough market threecheese toastie now i dont know if the two cooks know each other but assuming they dont the comparison is instructive reichl and oglethorpe both plump for sourdough cheddar and alliums all in large quantities thick slices of bread mountains of grated cheese and a medley of different coloured onions garlic and leek very finely chopped and the recipes dont so much differ as compete oglethorpe combines his cheddar with a washed rind and some comt while reichl adds both green onion and shallots to her veg she also really pushes the boat out adding butter on the inside of the bread and mayo and extra cheese on the outside because as food puts it at this point why not stella mccartney did an interview in october sitting in a west london cafe eating scrambled eggs on rye and the only reason i remember this is because of a throwaway line in brackets at the end of the sixth paragraph what i really want what i always really want she said musing on her eggs is baked potato and grilled cheese but then id be really fat maybe you would be ive always thought but oh so very happy every time grilled cheese on a baked tattie or spiked with alliums and sandwiched in sourdough is a true thing of beauty olympics mania has finally hit evident by our mostread articles this week our readers seemed to particularly enjoy our live blog of day five in rio detailing australian swimmer kyle chalmers winning gold in the m freestyle olympic swimming also garnered attention for less celebratory reasons with serious discrepancies in the entry times putting the sports credibility in doubt people also wanted to know why is the olympic diving pool green answers on a postcard please now lets talk politics also among our mostread was the news that jeremy corbyn and his deputy tom watson are locked in a public spat about whether the party risks being taken over by hard left activists who were driven out in the s and no news week would be complete without donald trump rearing his notso attractive head he caused a stir this week after he was accused of making an assassination threat against rival hillary clinton the guardians lucia graves wrote about this in an article that also featured in our mostread saying this is a new low even for trump whos been accused of inciting general violence and has verbally attacked individuals from khizr khan to rosie odonnell but hes never seemed to incite

i recently separated from my husband after years we have two teenage children my daughter has chosen to live with me my son with his dad it was all fairly amicable although the marriage was borderline abusive as my ex is quite controlling towards the end of the marriage i met a lovely man online and after i decided to leave my husband we met and started a relationship we were careful not to make it known my daughter is quite controlling as well and we have had quite a tempestuous start to our new life with her being very demanding and quite unpleasant sometimes after a few weeks she managed to get into my passwordprotected phone on a pretext and went through all my messages and phone logs and found out about my affair she demanded that i tell my husband about it i refused as it would just upset him and make our divorce even harder but after a week of her crying raging and telling me she couldnt see her dad again now she knew about this other man the next time i saw my husband i told him predictably he was hurt angry and has barely spoken to me since not even to sort out childcare arrangements or let me know my son is all right i wish i hadnt told him although i believe my daughter would have spilled the beans if i hadnt she had already told her brother he is fairly calm about it all basically i was blackmailed by my daughter when my new partner heard about this he was horrified he doesnt want any trouble or drama and can no longer imagine a life with me that involves my daughter he has ended things my life with my daughter is now very difficult as i dont trust her an inch and find all this very difficult to forgive her snooping and blackmail has cost me an amicable divorce and my new relationship however she is still only young and is my daughter i have already made her life very hard by leaving the family home and dont want to make things even worse by making her go back to live with her dad she doesnt want to do that i am at my wits end i feel like the worlds worst parent as well as feeling terribly sad about all of it im going to concentrate on the daughter angle of your letter which i have edited to protect identities on first reading of your longer letter your daughters behaviour does seem shocking but then i mused on it a while and thought about how her life must have been these past few years you in a borderline abusive marriage her family home split up her brother living somewhere else her mother conducting a relationship in secret which she clearly suspected and she is still a child i strongly believe people should be responsible for their actions but i also believe they should be allowed to grow into those responsibilities first if you forget for a moment about the way your daughter has gone about things and concentrate on what you think she might be trying to communicate to you what do you think that might be behind all behaviour there is a message which we shouldnt lose sight of you want to mend bridges with your daughter which is good but stop sending your friends messages calling your daughter names edited out of your letter here that is not going to help anyone and does not reflect well on you the psychotherapist naomi stadlen thinks that your daughter hasnt lost hope in having a relationship with you her anger shows she hasnt withdrawn stadlen feels that this crisis is an opportunity to turn things around for both of you and to find a way to talk to one another rather than the extremes of behaviour you both have at the moment your daughter is desperate she is trying to find out the worst hence the snooping because this tells her how bad it is she is snooping because she doesnt feel safe when we dont feel safe when we feel that information is being withheld most of us will try to find out whats going on the not knowing makes us insecure however says stadlen you cant ensure privacy until youve restored a certain amount of trust you are of course entitled to a private life and i would suggest taking control of this change the password on your phone dont give it to your daughter again presumably you did the first time otherwise your daughter should apply for a job with the fbi it is vital that you listen to your daughter advises stadlen her behaviour shows that she doesnt feel heard sit with her either by yourself or with a mediator and ask her to tell you what is wrong try not to justify or defend yourself give her time to shout calm down and finally tell you her real concerns that will help you to rebuild the trust between you there may be no quick answers to her problems but knowing she can confide in you will help your first task is to steady this rocking boat familymediationcouncilorguk your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the guardian kings place

one child is manageable for working mothers but the addition of a second can have a serious financial impact on those towards the bottom of the earnings ladder a new study finds that while the addition of a second child has little effect on the working hours of mothers in skilled jobs it has a substantial and negative effect on lowskilled women who are forced to reduce their hours considerably or even give up their jobs altogether the findings reinforce the view that there is a shortage of affordable childcare in the uk despite successive government attempts to help women into work in recent years the study by the centre for economic performance at the london school of economics to be presented at this months annual congress of the european economic association in geneva examined a group of women in the uk aged between and who had their first child between and economists claudia hupkau and marion leturcq examined the positions of women in skilled and lowskilled jobs before the birth of their first child they then examined their positions in the labour market when their first child was between six and years old the results were striking in the first decade of the millennium almost of all women with a child aged up to four were working in some form this compares with for women with a child aged between five and and reaches when the child is older but stark differences emerged when a second child arrived women in skilled jobs continued to combine work and having a larger family those who cut the number of hours they worked after the arrival of their second child did so due to a shift in their career aspirations rather than the demands posed by an addition to their family lowskilled mothers in contrast had no such option many were forced to severely decrease the number of weekly hours they worked after a second child the study showed that women in skilled jobs who had more than one child ended up working five hours less a week on average in contrast women in lowskilled jobs cut the amount they worked by an average hours a week following the arrival of their second child the proportion of women in unskilled jobs working in excess of hours a week dropped by more than it is often thought that women stay at home because they want to but the reality seems to be that they often do not have a choice or indeed that going back would make them financially worse off hupkau explained the findings present a challenge to the government as it tries to encourage more women into work our research indicates that it seems to be very difficult to combine working full time with having a second child for women working in lowskilled jobs and indeed for women and their families this will imply a significant drop in resources hupkau said more than childcare places have been created since following the launch of the national childcare strategy lowincome working families are currently given help with childcare via tax credits the government is also giving free parttime nursery places for all three and fouryearolds and disadvantaged twoyearolds but there are concerns that the initiative is not feasible the preschool learning alliance which represents nursery providers has warned that many do not have the capacity to deliver extra childcare places it is warning that without urgent action many parents who have been promised hours of free childcare may end up disappointed when the scheme is rolled out next year hupkau said that it was not enough simply to offer free childcare women in lowskilled jobs often have zero flexibility in the start and end times of their jobs being required to work in particular shifts or at very specific timesshe said if the government wants to help these women back into the workplace it must offer childcare that is adaptable to their particular needs,2016-08,one child manageable working mother addition second serious financial impact towards bottom earnings ladder new study find addition second

i am the eldest of four aged and have a teenager my parents divorced and lived in countries very far apart years ago when communication and travel were challenging and expensive the polarisation and rolecasting was set up early the first child is responsible and bookish no kind and motherly no the only son whom both parents prop up financially no is the baby and only one uninfluenced by the father and therefore good in the mothers eyes second child never had children fourth lived away and secretly from everyone until she was found after years both parents seem incapable of being grandparents almost disconnected with the children of no and but when emerges it is a chance to start anew however the old favouritism reemerges as well and is transferred on to the new grandchildren and longmissing child it has become so apparent the distinction in treatment that it is hurtful and deeply damaging to my child i have tried to have an open conversation with my mother about more than the weather or another sibling but am stopped before it starts and told that it is not possible and that i am influenced by past exposure to my father with whom i have not lived since i was and have seen briefly times in years i am at the point of disappearing from the mess the communication has worsened between siblings parents and children father is usually unavailable and mother critical seems like it was in the growingup years but compounded with an additional generation i have tried to discuss this with a close family friend and a psychologist but everyone begs off professional help has not given me any more skills before they die how can i keep the communication with my parents but stop getting the dregs there was a curious lack of detail in your letter which is reproduced almost in its entirety first is it deeply damaging to your child or to the child in you you mentioned your child briefly in a second email to me and it seemed you were more consciousworried of your child seeing how your mother has affected you your child has the added benefit of having you and her father i presume as a buffer they are not in the full glare of it it can be very damaging when parents show such distinct favouritism but it says more about them than the child not that this really helps you in the moment of feeling crushed and rejected favouritism can have its roots in a few things sometimes its that a child reminds the parent that they were a less than ideal motherfather in the early years and instead of seeking to remedy it cant bear the guilt the child reminds them of so they throw it back at the child sometimes certain children remind one parent of the other parent and this brings angst not joy some adults seem to forget that it was their choice whom they chose to have children with whatever the cause and there are many it is never the fault of the child and favouritism can harm all involved even the favourite so things may not be as rosy as you think for child no she did go off to live in secret after all dr susan benbow a psychotherapist aftorguk thinks your youngest sister going off disappearing for years begs a lot of questions and indeed it does it also sounds as if she didnt come back of her own volition but was found have you ever discussed this with your sister benbow also thinks that maybe your mother is living in fear of losing her again and making up for lost time this doesnt really excuse her behaviour toward you however there was very little about your father in your letter and it sounds as if your communication with your parents at least your mother is not face to face this can make an already difficult situation even harder but i was intrigued by where your siblings live and how you communicate with them how do you know about how this favouritism manifests now i think you need to look at what you would ideally like and ask yourself how achievable this is i hate to be defeatist but one must be realistic it sounds as if your mother hasnt got the selfawareness or will to change thus im afraid that the ideal relationship you want may never happen i wonder if you might consider shifting your focus away from your parents and on to to your siblings instead is there a sibling you are closer to could you start with them ask them how it is for them i honestly think the key to this is in you building adult friendships if you can with your siblings put your energies into them and your own immediate family a dysfunctional sibling relationship is often but not exclusively set up in childhood while the children stay under the umbrella of the parents geographically emotionally etc that relationship often cant grow into adulthood you might be amazed by what could happen if you stop craving parental approval and start forging your own relationship with your siblings not the one your parents have defined for you you mention professional help hasnt aided you not all professional help is equal look for someone who deals with

a bird is a small fragile thing it chirrups flutters and nests it definitely does not chair board meetings run multinational corporations or govern nations so its little surprise that a new survey shows bird topping the list of pet names that british women would like banned from everyday use the research commissioned by kelloggs special k surveyed women around the country fiftyfour per cent said bird was a word theyd like to consign for ever to room would bin doll would choose chick while loathe babe theyre all diminutives youll notice infantile in the case of chick and babe in all four cases incapable of speech or even complex thought cute but ultimately unable to change a light bulb unaided but oh come on now love what does it really matter theyre just words after all harmless terms of affection in fact the chosen names arent even insults or sexist slurs who doesnt love a fluffy chick wheres the harm in being compared to one so stop flapping about it dont brood over it all this nagging is just henpecking a single word you see can hatch and breed until you have a whole flock of related words each different but all related all pecking slowly away at womens self confidence shaping the way women are seen in the workplace and having consequences every bit as real as the damage done by sticks and stones another report came out this week this time from the global management consultancy firm mckinsey and co and sheryl sandbergs lean in organisation it analysed data from american companies representing million employees and for every women promoted to managerial positions it found men made the same leap up the ladder why in part because birds arent being given the opportunity to show their ability the report highlighted the fact that women are less likely to be given challenging assignments or to receive the critical feedback we all need in order to get any better at the jobs we do while of the men surveyed said they had received difficult feedback only of women had the most common reason managers gave for holding back this criticism from women was the fear of being hurtful and who wants to hurt a little fluffy chick that would just be mean a couple of years ago in the course of writing a book called leading ladies i spoke to of britains most influential women across all fields and from different walks of life in an interview with the psychotherapist susie orbach she told me i think we have a little difficulty with female public intellectuals in this country because we still attribute gravitas to masculinity stories such as this piled up betty jackson cbe one of the uks most successful fashion designers described how when we first applied for a loan from the bank the bank manager addressed all his questions to her husband david even though hes french and could barely speak a word of english at the time i had to translate between them things have moved on since the s and many of these terms sound peculiarly oldfashioned but words can still hold women back as the brilliant baroness lola young currently an independent crossbench peer told me ambition is almost a dirty word sometimes especially when applied to women its meant as a covert insult shes a really ambitious woman perhaps surprisingly mckinseys research showed that more women than men ask for a raise at work compared with of men in response of women were told that they were being bossy aggressive or intimidating compared with just of men no surprise then that the fifth most hated term singled out by british women is queen bee because in a world where the fond nicknames for women are fluffy and cute being a boss becomes a mild insult words matter you can kill two birds with one stone but you dent the ambitions of billion of them around the world by showering them with a whole lexicon of little pebbles,2016-09,bird small fragile thing chirrup flutter nest definitely doe chair board meeting run multinational corporation govern nation little

were simply focusing on how to survive those are the words of a domestic abuse worker in nottingham but the survival chloe cheeseman is describing refers to that of an organisation built to help women and girls in danger rather than the women and girls themselves an indictment of whats happening to domestic violence services in this country equation the charity cheeseman works for offers the sort of services any of us would want in our community training frontline workers police midwives social workers about domestic violence supporting mens services to help male survivors of abuse and going into local schools to teach young people about healthy relationships to tackle abuse before it starts for over two decades its been funding from the city and county councils thats made this work possible but as of this financial year equation has had its funding reduced by that translates to a cut of over over the past year the latest local authority contracts cheeseman tells me dont even fully cover overheads as basic as rent heating and phone bills more than schools in the city are currently relying on equation to deliver projects for pupils sex and relationships education is still not a part of the national curriculum despite the fact it is young women aged from to who are most at risk of domestic violence weve built relationships with these schools for years cheeseman says now were in a situation where we either ask the schools for more money or fundraise or we have to cut it it would be convenient for theresa may and colleagues keen to distance themselves from austerity cuts for this to look like an isolated case a council shirking its responsibilities in truth nottinghams budget cuts are the result of a government ideologically set on squeezing local authorities over key services and it is happening up and down the country this gets grimmer still when you consider that money the governments set aside to help local councils is largely finding its way to wealthy toryrun areas such as surrey hampshire and oxfordshire nottingham like liverpool manchester and others sits on the list of councils that have received nothing nottingham city council has tried so so hard because they recognise how important this is cheeseman says but the reality is the pot is shrinking theres ever decreasing pots of money available in this climate equation has been left in cheesemans words to plug the gap of the cuts where it could once dedicate its time to tackling domestic violence in the city the charity has been forced to fundraise for the money it needs to pay for it anything from marathons cakebaking or bathtubs of beans cheeseman joined equation as a fundraiser in the organisations first one there was no need before then she says now weve had to recruit two last year in a bid to find more income the charity had to make customers pay for its training services rather than providing them for free it is now approaching private companies to make equation their charity of the month but its an uphill battle cancer and animal charities are an easier choice for companies in a society that still routinely hides domestic violence nottingham as a city was recently praised for its efforts to tackle genderbased harassment with its police force becoming the first in the country to make misogyny a hate crime cheeseman herself was one of the first women to report such an incident to the police this summer when three men yelled sexually aggressive comments at her as she walked through a secluded wooded area in the city she was on her way to work at the time theres an irony that as the city works to police abuse violence and harassment the choices of central government mean a service thats tackling the problem is having its funding squeezed as with the closure of womens refuges around the country this isnt just shortsighted or even dangerous it sends a message that domestic violence services much like childrens centres and social care for disabled people and the elderly are now a frivolity that the state feels free to discard,2016-09,simply focusing survive word domestic abuse worker nottingham survival chloe cheeseman describing

what would you do with its a nice problem to have but not one the majority of us will ever have to grapple with given that the average uk income is the threshold is what it takes to become one of the uks superrich the top of earners in the country they are concentrated in sectors such as finance and business and between them they are worth more than bn to the uks economy it also just so happens that only one in five of them are women according to new research released by the lse this should be of little surprise to anyone given that gender inequality continues to permeate every sphere of life the upper echelons of the corporate world included underrepresentation is rife old boys networks persist and a pay gap emerges as a result its just one manifestation of a social order in which women are marginalised but while this is undoubtedly frustrating for the individual women held back by a glass ceiling at the very top of their careers its difficult to see it as a key feminist issue in the context of the visceral economic inequalities facing the uks most disadvantaged women this brand of corporate feminism concerned with women in boardrooms and the equal distribution of millionaires has gained much attention over the last few years in large part due to the lean in philosophies of top businesswomen such as facebooks sheryl sandberg and yahoos marissa mayer work hard dream big want it enough say these these wealthy white highly educated women and you can achieve anything its attractive as a marketing exercise for gender equality the onus is on individuals to just try a bit harder while systemically unequal structures keep ticking along in the background inevitably individual women predisposed to make it by privilege do so and are held up as role models for having it all but structural barriers and societal inequality dont just evaporate when you set your mind to something and as a real model for womens liberation it fails evidence shows that an increase in women business leaders has little impact on anyone but the women leaders themselves its a work promotion dressed up as a feminist campaign this then is the issue with framing the underrepresentation of women among the superrich as a feminist issue economic inequality is indeed a key force in marginalising women but its not because were having to remortgage a mansion to pay for a cruise rather women are more likely to be reliant on social security and insecure work and thus end up hit hardest by austerity measures were more likely to have caring responsibilities and financial dependants but less likely to control the households finances in employment terms too there are very real feminist issues to be addressed cuts to legal aid that disproportionately affect women the fact that were overrepresented in the lowpaid service industries or indeed the unpaid domestic one the plight of wealthy employed women frustrated in joining what is essentially an elite private members club somewhat pales in comparison if capitalism plays a key role in sustaining gender inequality in all of these ways it follows that a focus on women in corporate leadership may not just be naive and ultimately useless but in fact a completely false flag its a mantra that feminism is about nothing more than equality with men but at its logical conclusion this suggests that the appearance of women in any space currently dominated by men is a success in and of itself in fact big corporations and structural inequality are entangled in a symbiotic relationship that will never be addressed by individual women filling the moulds of the men before them feminism should challenge this inequality at its roots rather than simply change its figureheads the significance of the lses research for feminists then should be in what it says about gross economic inequality rather than the limited financial ability of the most privileged women to oppress others a worthwhile feminist focus would be on the redistribution of wealth to redress the gendered effects of poverty and employment indeed aiming for a society in which everyone has enough to survive would seem a more pressing priority than making the rich richer because for as long as the vast majority of women make little more than in their entire working lives the genders of those doing so in a year mean very little in

fewer than one in five of the uks top of earners are women according to a study that highlights a stubborn gender divide among the superrich researchers writing for the london school of economics found the uk picture was replicated in all seven other countries they studied with men always making up a majority of the top income groups women accounted for less than a third of those in the top in all the countries higher up the income distribution the proportion was lower still with women constituting between and of the top according to the study published by the lses international inequalities institute on tuesday women now make up more of the top income groups but they still are a distinct minority and they become rarer the higher one climbs said coauthor alessandra casarico a professor at bocconi university in italy composition of income is important in the old days the rich were those with property they have been replaced by ceos and entrepreneurs among whom women are not well represented the researchers used tax data and looked at income from work and other sources such as investments to see how many of the top and top were women in australia canada denmark italy new zealand norway spain and the uk they found the presence of women in the top income groups had generally increased over time except in australia but the growth in the proportion of women had been faster for the top than among the very richest or top in this sense there appears to be something of a glass ceiling for women the report said in the uk women made up of the top income group which covers those on annual pretax incomes of or more using figures women made up of the uks top those on or more they were just of the top who are on or more that was the lowest female representation among the six countries where comparable data was available on the the highest was in spain in the uk while the share of women in the top and top has risen since the s the share of women in the top was little changed said the authors the researchers also found that investment played a more important role as a source of income via payouts such as interest and dividends for women than for men in the top income groups possible reasons include households seeking to minimise their tax liabilities by transferring investment income from the higher earner to the lower one and in most cases that was the woman they also put forward another rather unromantic theory it could also be the result of positive assortative mating in the marriage market whereby women at the top marry men with similar

it will be more than half a century before the gender pay gap closes in the uk according to a report that highlights the gulf between men and womens earnings even at the outset of their careers progress on closing the pay gap has been so slow that on current trends it will not be eradicated until or years after the equal pay act according to an analysis by consultants deloitte laying bare the challenge for government as it seeks to tackle inequality the report finds that at the very start of their working lives women graduates are earning less than their male peers in many jobs that gap holds true even in sectors where women workers dominate such as healthcare and teaching in all but one of popular occupations for graduates men start out on higher average salaries than women in all the gap widens over time the gender pay gap has come down to its lowest on record at for fulltime workers and the government has pledged to eliminate it in a generation but progress remains very slow according to deloitte it found the difference in hourly pay between fulltime men and women was closing at a rate of just p a year the fawcett society campaign group said the findings highlighted missed opportunities for women and for businesses who were not making the most of womens skills and experience at the current rate of progress young women starting work today will have retired by the time we close the gender pay gap none of us can afford to wait that long said jemima olchawski the fawcett societys head of policy and insight one of the widest gaps in starting salaries is for health professionals at or according to deloittes analysis of official figures and data from the higher education statistics agency that is despite more than threequarters of graduates in the sector being female in teaching where a similar proportion are women the gap in starting salaries is or starting salaries are only equal at in administrative occupations but in that sector a gap emerges over time and in the other nine sectors it gets wider according the deloittes analysis the report says the reasons for the uks gender pay gap for fulltime workers are complex factors include women being more likely to take jobs where pay is relatively low such as in care women taking time out for family reasons and women taking more poorly paid parttime jobs when they return there may also be unconscious discrimination at work and within organisations that affect decisions about jobs and pay the report added however the report identified lessons for policymakers in the significantly smaller gap in starting salaries between men and women who have studied science technology engineering and mathematics stem subjects and who go on to take jobs in those sectors analysing pay gaps by degree qualifications rather than by occupation the authors found there was no difference in average starting salary between men and women graduates of engineering and technology and for subjects allied to medicine and dentistry the report calls for more action by ministers schools and businesses to get girls studying stem subjects there are many factors that contribute to the gender pay gap one of these occurs before entering the workforce when boys and girls decide what to study at school and university said emma codd managing partner for talent at deloitte starting at gcse level where three times more boys than girls take computing and more boys than girls study design and technology these early decisions drive fundamental skill differences between the genders for those entering the workplace the report also recommends more help for women with stem qualifications to stay in related jobs the researchers found as many as of women with stem qualifications were not working in relevant industries the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said helping women to stay in stem careers was crucial to closing the gender pay gap alongside ensuring that work in sectors where women have traditionally worked such as caring is properly rewarded we need action on the pay and quality of parttime work flexible work opportunities affordable childcare and more independent paid leave for fathers ogrady said deloittes report sounded an optimistic note that government rules from next april forcing bigger employers to publish their pay gap should spur businesses into greater action a government spokesman highlighted those new rules and added we agree that getting more girls into stem subjects can play a part we are continuing to encourage more girls to study these subjects and last year more girls sat alevels in stem subjects compared to he said,2016-09,half century gender pay gap close uk according report highlight gulf men womens earnings even outset career progress

my elder sister has always been tricky for me to deal with as she is very critical and suspicious of anyones opinions or motives and pulls everyone down for their life choices for the sake of our elderly mother we all try to bumble along but this has not been easy due to ill health i have had more financial support from mum than my sister on the proviso that all will be evened out with any future inheritance this has caused tensions between my sister and myself understandably but i have done my best to make sure everyone in the family knows and agrees about this i have found it particularly difficult as my elder sister is twofaced about it encouraging me to ask mum for help against any future money while saying very horrible things to my other sister my mother now has early onset dementia her memory is poor and mum is anxious that we siblings all get on because of this mum will tell us different things which of course makes honest communication between us all even more tricky mum has decided to move to live near my elder sister we are all a bit sad about this having offered for many years to have her live with us but all want whats best for her my sister has now become very difficult and refuses to involve my brother or me in any plans she gets on with my younger sister while with mum recently i read her post for her to find that my elder sister has now been awarded power of attorney poa because i find my sister so slippery to deal with as i find she moves the truth around to suit her defensive position i thought long and hard about how to request that she keeps my brother and me in the loop her reply was simply why should i i just dont know how to deal with her and want very much to be fair did your mother actively know and approve the power of attorney did she have capacity to do that she can only grant poa if she has capacity and in that case only the person giving it in this case your mother can apply for it your sister should not have applied for it on her behalf any conversation about poa says gary rycroft a solicitor and member of the law society wills and equity committee should start with the person who wants to give poa saying id like to give poa to not someone saying id like to apply for poa for in dealing with a tricky member of the family my advice is to always pick the medium you best converse in so if you cant talk to each other could you consider email for communication that way too you will have a record of what has been said its interesting that your younger sister gets on with her and i wonder if she could be the one to bring you all together in this does your elder sister keep the younger one in the loop about your mothers care ive taken out the location where your mother may be moving to as i didnt want to identify you but note that if she does move outside england and wales different laws may apply according to where her assets are how do your other siblings feel if your mother wants you all to get on is she aware that you can all be given poa by her just because you dont get on very well with your sister doesnt mean that she will mishandle your mothers affairs but i do think that even in the most convivial family being transparent united and correct in the way you handle things for an elderly person is a good idea i think you and your other siblings need to establish exactly what your mother wants this is key it is her life and assets we are talking about the questions to ask are who does she want to have as poa does she know all her children can be given poa does she want you to have poa for property and finance or welfare and health or both there are two types is her will up to date and does it reflect if she wants it to who has already had money from her such as you when you do this also ask your mum about her advance care planning and how shed like you to act on her behalf says rycroft no one likes to look into a future where a parent cant decide things for themselves but it can make difficult decisions further down the line so much easier contact the office of the public guardian if you feel your mothers best interests are not being served ie you have a concern about how your sister is handling your mothers affairs rycroft thinks the answer to your sisters question why should i is simple because we are also our mothers children and we care about what happens to her your priority is your mother and her care if she is being well looked after if her wishes are being followed and if she is not in any way being exploited you may need to leave your difference with your sister to one side for now but i still believe all of you should be involved with your mother and your sisters care of her should include keeping her siblings up to date a useful

it is unusual to enter my teenage daughters room without some degree of hazard there are teetering piles of detritus there are mugs with green liquid in them there are sometimes surprising odours not all of them pleasant so why dont i tell her to clean it up well i do occasionally but not with much determination or hope of compliance partly because i find the traditional objection to this kind of parental instruction hard to argue against its my room whats your problem one can make the conventional response actually if you check the legal documents youll find that technically its my room but this doesnt get you very far and can take you down one of those logical rabbit burrows at the end of which inevitably lies well you didnt have to have me in the first place did you the point is their room is indeed in spirit if not legally their space maybe we should just leave them to wallow in it i suspect my wife thinks im lax for entertaining such views and i was tempted to agree until my lack of resolve was stiffened by a recent article in the new york times headlined should i make my daughter clean her room the selfconfessed controlfreak mother answers the question with a rather reluctant but finally resounding no she suggests that the jackson pollockinspired crash scene that is her yearold daughters room needs to be kept under control but that the mothers impulse to tidy can be compulsive a way to maintain control in the face of anxiety its a sound insight part of the reason we want our children to clean their rooms is the same reason we want them to eat their greens it is symbolic rather than logical we worry about it because we have a low emotional tolerance of chaos even other peoples chaos confined within four walls if you want to be less philosophical you could argue that your children should maintain a tidy space because untidy spaces are inefficient and look ugly but again its not your space so why worry you can plead hygiene but the number of teenagers suffering serious infections as a result of poor roomhygiene so far as i am aware remains remarkably low you could say that tidying is teaching them how to survive in the outside world but i think thats a rationalisation some children are tidy and some are not and theres nothing much you can do about it untidy people muddle through somehow i know because im one of them there are other good reasons to refrain from endlessly nagging teenagers about cleaning up their room if my daughter is anything to go by they work extremely hard at school and have little enough agency when they get home giving them some control and a space to call their own is psychologically important but there are limits once you discover rodent droppings or for that matter rodents under the bedside table some action needs to be taken but more often than not our response should be let it go as a psychologist quoted in the nyt article observed the more you make it an issue the more youll prolong the problem another psychologist made a different but equally pertinent point whats important for children is structure she said which is not necessarily the same thing as a clean room if you need further

unions have shrugged off concerns from an peak employer group that a proposed new employee right to domestic violence leave could be used by perpetrators of family violence the australian council of trade unions actu which has been running a case to establish the right to days paid leave has responded that perpetrators will be excluded from the provision and labelled the concern a nonsense in submissions to the fair work commission the australian industry group aig has argued that the unions proposed definition of people experiencing domestic violence would allow perpetrators to take days leave even if the proposed definition were changed perpetrators could still access leave if a victim engaged in threatening or abusive behaviour in selfdefence it said aig submitted the union case had ignored the incidence of violence between partners that is committed by both parties to the relationship in response the actu president ged kearney said the actus position which is clearly outlined in its submissions is that eligibility for leave should be restricted to victims of family and domestic violence not perpetrators aigs head of workplace relations policy stephen smith told guardian australia some of its members that offer domestic violence leave had experienced perpetrators applying for leave because policies havent been clear enough that they are not entitled to it with company policies often companies have the flexibility to look at the circumstances and whether leave is appropriate but an award clause is enforceable and legally binding kearney told guardian australia the concern was nonsense and called for aig to deal with this in a grownup collaborative manner to make a difference to the people who are harmed by one of the biggest scourges that society has to deal with to come out with this is missing the point she said workplaces with domestic violence leave already found it was working very well to support the people affected the violence perpetrated by a partner kearney said granting leave involved some discernment by employers but the actu claim makes clear employees can be asked for evidence of their need for leave for example to go to court move house or go to hospital aigs other objections to the term include that the full days of paid leave could be accessed by parttime and casual employees and the leave was not necessary to include in industrial awards that set minimum conditions aigs chief executive innes willox said the unions onesize fits all approach to family violence was not appropriate because employers had different capacities to provide support to employees experiencing domestic violence many large employers have relevant policies to assist employee victims he said smaller employers often do not have written policies but they typically adopt a reasonable and compassionate approach when their employees suffer genuine hardships kearney said all available evidence shows that the provision of days paid leave for awarddependent employees leads to positive outcomes for employers and employees she said the union claim would build on and complement domestic violence victim assistance that some larger corporations including pricewaterhousecoopers national australia bank and telstra already offer while many employees are now covered by enterprise agreements containing family and domestic violence leave bargaining outcomes have not been consistent she said this is exactly why the actu is seeking a variation to all modern awards to ensure clarity and consistency for all,2016-09,union shrugged

its been a few weeks since you told me you wanted a professional relationship with me no doubt you think this is appropriate as we work at the same institution but you seem to have forgotten that we have three children together and a professional relationship does not really cover their needs you probably think my avoiding you at work is unprofessional but whose is the greater ethical crime does it really affect our kids if i do not engage with you at meetings or at service activities probably not but it does affect them when you do not engage on coparenting issues such as their birthdays whether i decide to move on or not and finance but what about us we managed two years of separation well the kids felt secure when we got on well and we enjoyed it on the whole we were the gwyneth paltrow and chris martin of our community i was proud of that and so were the kids there were bumps along the way largely to do with incoming gossip and a lack of communication but really we did well now we cannot stand the sight of each other a relatively mild complaint from me was the cause of you ending our friendship you said to me in the way in which you talk to your yearold students you need to do something about that patronising manner of yours that it was the straw that broke the camels back in which case i can only suggest that your camel is a pretty spineless creature or that you simply grasped an opportunity to cut me out of your life i have tried to communicate with you first to get back on an even keel and restore the friendship second to coparent effectively but my emails are dismissed stop sending me emails like this or ignored even when they involve our childrens wellbeing i have suggested mediation you go to counselling if you want i wont i wonder about your maturity given the evidence that you are unable to put aside our differences and display a united front for our kids is your pride more important than they are so i am leaving it seems it means leaving our youngest with you do not be flattered into thinking he particularly wants to live with you we all know he would rather live with me he just doesnt want to leave his school and his friends our middle child says i shouldnt go because you will not be able to care properly for his brother in terms of feeding him a healthy diet and watching his back at school after all that was always my job i send you emails about that and you dont reply you dont appear to be acting on any of it from what i am told by our sons teachers can i trust you to do these things if i leave so take a long hard look at yourself as a father and as an exhusband you may be feeling very happy with yourself having found a pretty young woman and no doubt she is satisfying your needs i hope you will be happy with her please consider her motives and dont make a fool of yourself and dont risk our kids inheritance i dont suppose you have written a will yet we were together for years while i was certainly not a perfect wife i played an important role in your life and career and to be reduced to being referred to as a professional relationship is heartless of you i was your lover and best friend career counsellor and financial manager and most importantly i am still the mother of your three children as for me i know i will be happier if i dont see you every day i am already happier now that i dont have to worry about your moods and long silences your lack of empathy your opinions on my underwear my hair my clothes my shoes finally i can get back to being myself if i can ever find that person again your loving exwife,2016-09,week since told wanted professional relationship doubt think appropriate work institution seem forgotten three child together professional relationship doe really

my teenage daughter is and very rude when my partner comes over i have only been dating him for nine months but i have known him for years he is a widower and his wife and i were friends before she died nearly three years ago i have been divorced for five years my ex has remarried and divorced again and had other relationships in that time i dont know what to do with my daughter i have tried talking to her calmly asking her to help me to understand why she doesnt like him she loved him before i started dating him she actually asked me to tell him to leave her th birthday as she didnt want him there i have explained to her that he is the nicest man i know or have ever dated and he treats everybody lovingly i even said to her one day after asking her to give me one good reason why i should break up with him and she couldnt admitting theres nothing wrong with him that i was going to continue seeing him so she needs to start showing him respect as an older person in her life and either suck it up or pretend to suck it up that she needs to be civil etc none of this has worked she is still rude to him to the point of being nasty im at a loss can you please help its great to sit down and ask her calmly why she doesnt like your new partner but only if you really want to know the answer not so you can issue ultimatums the reason she doesnt like him may not be easy for her to articulate this is because she may like him after all she used to it may be the combination of you and him she doesnt like and that will be hard for her to express because she loves you there may also be something else upsetting her about your new boyfriend however much he was previously loved by her and you need to give her the space to tell you certainly you cant command someone to show respect to someone and especially not just because they are older i dont see why it always works just one way this phrase used to annoy me as a child and it still annoys me as an adult respect has to be earned it has to be clearly mirrored back you shouldnt ask your daughter give me one reason why i should break up with him and follow it by saying that you are going to continue a relationship with him anyway that is only going to make her incredibly defensive i asked alison roy a child psychotherapist childpsychotherapyorguk for her opinion she also thinks it may be the combination of the two of you she objects to rather than him alone i suspect the problem is not about him but you both as a combined unit now a couple it sounds as if this is either your first relationship since divorcing your daughters father or your first big relationship and we thought that was significant it sounds says roy as if youve been the only consistent relationship in her life and now you are pouring your affections into someone else roy also says that even though your daughter knew your boyfriend before its quite different for her now that he is your partner a sexual relationship is much more threatening much more exclusive your daughter may feel she has lost the relationship she had with two people who have now become one her status as being central is threatened to your daughter he may not be the bonus you think he is to the family unit she says we wondered if you had asked your daughter if she wanted your partner to come to her birthday celebration birthdays especially when youre a teenager says roy can be really intense family times was he there for your benefit or for hers roy suggests working this out with your daughter letting her make decisions where its reasonable without allowing her to dictate or damage your relationship you need to make it clear what is acceptable being vile to others is not ok but expressing that shes not happy is ok i feel your daughter is asking you for time in with you so be careful you dont shut her down or silence her this really doesnt mean letting her call all the shots but with for example something such as her birthday which is really about her let her invite who she wants you will both need to negotiate a middle ground also do you still make time for her one to one are there still places and times when its just you and her this is really important and will continue to be important throughout your lives onetoone time between each childparent is vastly underestimated as an important parenting tool i know you may feel this is your time and the start of a new relationship is heady and exciting but think long term a final note when you are trying to get people onside or help them adapt to a new situation its a really bad idea to

after decades of dismissing issues impacting working families donald trump is scrambling to win over women voters with a child care plan announced on tuesday while democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton released her child care proposal months ago trump has put a new coat of paint on the same tired policies that prioritize wealthy people like himself at the expense of working families trumps plan is mainly a tax deduction which would allow parents to deduct the average price of child care from their taxes even with the other new bells and whistles included in trumps plan such as income caps rebates and savings accounts trumps proposal will innately benefit the people who need the least help covering child care expenses while lower income and middle class families are left behind as many have pointed out the value of a tax deduction is directly linked to the tax rate you pay under trumps plan wealthy families making would get a child care tax break of about for every they pay for child care meanwhile families making would only get for every spent on child care even if a middleclass family spends the same amount as a wealthy family for child care the wealthy familys tax cut is much larger trumps plan completely fails to address the daytoday realities of americas working families because it fails to address the underlying problem it does nothing to make child care affordable in the united states the average cost of centerbased child care for the typical working family with an infant and preschooler is about a steep price for families to cover if a family cannot afford child care a tax deduction is irrelevant a family cant deduct something that they cant pay for to begin with the same flaw applies to the rebate aimed at lowincome families under trumps plan in response to criticism that his plan is a windfall for the wealthiest families trump is looking to appeal to struggling americans but this just wont cut it a credit of would be perfect if the goal was to help families afford childcare for a month not a year we need a major new plan for childcare in america particularly as of children under six in the united states who have both parents in the workforce but by failing to address the issue of childcare affordability many parents and especially mothers will be forced to make impossible choices between their paycheck and their childs care under trumps plan in stark contrast to donald trumps childcare plan is that put forth by his opponent hillary clinton which zeros in on the issue of affordability clintons plan aims to ease the financial strain of childcare for all families by capping costs at of household income while also increasing wages for childcare providers her plan which has been publicly available for a year and was formally announced at a campaign event in may prioritizes families that need the most help and would in fact make childcare more affordable clinton also prioritizes improving childcare quality with a plan to address chronically low wages and training for childcare providers trumps failure to adequately address childcare costs will only perpetuate the increasingly common occurrence of parents leaving the workforce to become full time caregivers since many workers realize that it doesnt make economic sense to spend so much of their income on childcare for parents who are forced to drop out of the workforce because they simply cannot afford childcare the economic costs follow them throughout their lifetimes in fact the center for american progress found that this leads to the domino effect of parents losing out on roughly of their lifetime earnings while its far past time that childcare took center stage in our national political and policy debate american families and our economy need better than trumps regressive and haphazard plan the country needs a serious and major national solution to put highquality affordable childcare and early education within reach for working families trumps plan completely misses the mark,2016-09,decade dismissing issue impacting working family donald trump scrambling win woman voter child care plan announced tuesday democratic

my husband and i have been married for nearly a decade weve had some difficult things to deal with over the years we also had children in rapid succession which has been wonderful but very hard work i felt i was increasingly struggling particularly as his tendency is to be very negative and critical of me i felt i was looking after the children working supporting him and still for him i wasnt working hard enough or paying enough attention to the house or children he would find fault with everything i did and talk about me abandoning the children for work if i tried to protest about this or other things that upset me he would point out that i was wrong or didnt understand or just stop talking to me until i apologised i did still feel i loved him and was trying to hold it all together until a year ago when i sort of broke down and said i couldnt do it any more his reaction was to say i was depressed we went to relate but he stopped going when the counsellor said he was controlling and felt the relationship had characteristics of domestic abuse i suggested we separate for a while just so i could get some peace and headspace back but that triggered a tirade of criticism of me how ive hurt him and the children till im absolutely in bits mediation triggered the same response were now with another therapist that hes found but im struggling with the sessions feeling panicky and worn down as it seems like however much i say this is hurting me the emphasis is on finding a way for us to be together again i dont know what to do i dont even know how to get to a place where doing something seems possible sometimes it seems easiest to give in and try to make everyone happy please help me as im getting increasingly ill with the stress and worry please believe me this is real and im not just depressed i believe you your longer letter was desperate what i have reproduced above is what you said i could without you being identified so there is much i cannot refer to you sound like a woman whose life is closing in on her you have every right to want to walk away from a relationship that is making you unhappy if thats what you decide but i appreciate this isnt easy for you to do i think you know that this relationship is abusive abuse is not necessarily physical google the power and control wheel for a useful graphic on understanding domestic violence and its harming you very much your longer letter showed great awareness but while you seem to recognise what is happening you seem paralysed by an inability to believe it which is leading to indecision the impression i get is of someone spinning round and round in their thoughts so much so that they werent able to stand still and see what was happening any more there are positives in your life that i want you to keep in sight you have family and friends in whom you have confided who will support you you have a job these are all things that will help you through but i want you to take one step at a time the first thing to do is call the national domestic violence helpline on and keep trying if you dont get through straightaway i know youve been to some womens aid dropin sessions but it didnt seem as if you had really talked to someone and that is key i wondered if part of you is scared of actually talking to someone who knows as this will force you to face up to what is happening and that in turn will make you feel you have to do something this is completely understandable but you have to ask yourself what will happen if you do nothing imagine five years from now you do need to talk to a domestic violence adviser who understands what you are going through who wont minimise how you feel or say its your fault you need to find out what your rights are especially relating to your home and children i know this worries you and what your options are and then you can make a decision based on facts not just fear please remember your safety and your childrens safety is top priority so please

researchers from londons cass business school and the universities of warwick and wisconsin announced on monday to great fanfare that women in their s and s negotiate for salary increases just as often as their male peers do although this finding directly contradicts a substantial body of wellvetted research this new study has yet to be published in a peerreviewed journal and close examination of the data reveals conflicting results that are sure to be debated in academic circles its hard not to want this to be true if younger women have more confidence than women over when it comes to asking for more money we should all celebrate the research raises a few red flags though using data collected from companies by the australian government in the papers authors benjamin artz amanda h goodall and andrew j oswald contend that theyve discredited the standard explanation for womens reluctance to negotiate which they describe as fear of damaging the quality of their relationships at work taking aim at the research of carnegiemellon economist linda babcock and the book she and i wrote together women dont ask they claim to have disproven our central thesis by showing that women try to negotiate as frequently as men do they boast that theyve absolved women of the charge presumably made by us that they contribute to their own wage gap but fear of damaging relationships is only one of several barriers identified in babcocks research and described in women dont ask blaming women never figured in our analysis instead we clearly demonstrated that womens reluctance to ask was a learned behaviour rather than an intrinsic quality as this new paper claims and we explored in depth the powerful social forces that put roadblocks in womens way womens reluctance to negotiate was never attributed to weak will or a failure of nerve babcocks research identified another significant cause for this difference between men and women which she dubbed opportunity recognition women dont negotiate for themselves as often as men do babcock found because they dont always recognise opportunities to negotiate they assume that salaries follow a fixed schedule they expect to be treated fairly without needing to hustle or they imagine theyll be rewarded for good work without having to ask women also typically dont belong to the insider networks in which men share a lot of information about whats available women dont negotiate as much as men do in other words because they dont know that they can negotiate and often have less information about what they could be asking for the data from australia although it looks narrowly at salary negotiations and only at negotiations within an existing job not negotiations for a new job seems to bear this out while the women and men polled worked for the same employers far more women than men reported that pay was not negotiable in their jobs although its possible that a higher percentage of women were employed in jobs with fixed salaries it also seems likely that many women wrongly assumed they could not negotiate they didnt hesitate to ask for more money because they feared damaging a relationship but because they believed inaccurately that negotiation wasnt possible still assuming that younger women are negotiating for pay increases more frequently than older women even if not at equivalent rates to men how do we explain the obduracy of substantial wage disparities the artz goodall and oswald research provides one clue men in their selected sample were more likely than women to get a raise when they asked women who asked for raises were often turned down this is not a surprise as a society we dont like women we deem to be too aggressive and we see negotiation as an aggressive act meaning women routinely encounter more resistance when they do ask both men and women expect women to concede more and accept less in a negotiation but theres more artz goodall and oswalds narrow focus on salary negotiations presents a distorted picture of womens challenges when it comes to negotiating negotiating for more money may lead the list of asks with which women struggle but its far from the only one babcocks research and my interviews with women revealed that the proscription against women negotiating for themselves discourages them from asking for many other things that can heavily impact their success men are more likely than women to ask to be assigned to prestige projects highprofile teams and highvalue accounts for example theyre more likely to ask to be promoted when they feel theyre ready and more likely to ask for additional training or a chance to improve their skills or expand their networks theyre more likely to ask for the support of a mentor or sponsor and in fields where referrals are necessary to build a practice theyre more likely to ask for referrals all of this can widen the gap between mens and womens earnings where do we go from here women can learn to negotiate in ways that dont seem threatening or too aggressive this can help but this is another fix the woman solution that can only take us so far a true fix to this problem must be driven by employers themselves fortunately theres reason for hope failing to bring womens salaries and access to opportunity in line with mens will start to get very expensive in the near future broad demographic shifts make this an absolute certainty all over the world women are earning far more undergraduate and advanced degrees than men meaning that women will shortly dominate the educated workforce to remain competitive organisations that depend on educated workers will need to find ways to take advantage of this rich pool of talent doing so will require a lot more than posting a help wanted sign it will require reengineering corporate culture it will require persuading leaders at all levels from junior managers to top executives of the need for change women may be getting better at asking for more employers need to realise that its in their own best interests to give it to them,2016-09,researcher london cass business school university warwick wisconsin announced monday great fanfare woman

on wednesday at pmqs theresa may claimed that this government has a very good record on domestic violence im not certain what record she is referring to but its not one that i recognise in the united kingdom on average two women are killed by their current partner or a former partner every week children lose their mother a sibling loses their sister a woman loses her life at the hands of in the main male violence every three or so days domestic violence and violence against women have increased rapidly between and pushing up overall levels of violent crime analysis of ons crime statistics in england and wales from onwards shows an increase in domestic violence and violence against women perpetrated by their acquaintances violence against women by strangers remains level and violence against men continues to fall simply put women are bearing the brunt of violent crime in england and wales and it is being carried out against them by the people who are closest to them this doesnt sound like a record the prime minister should be proud of as well as making baseless claims of success this government has chosen to pull the safety net from beneath the feet of women escaping violence while theresa may was home secretary womens services saw their funding shrink rapidly between and a third of local authority funding to domestic and sexual violence services was cut the result a third of all referrals to refuges are turned away since we have lost of specialist refuges in england these safe havens are often run by survivors of domestic violence who understand the dynamics of abuse in the different communities they work in the impact on refuges for black and minority ethnic women in particular has been devastating specialist refuges simply cannot compete with the local authority tendering processes which are forced to value costperbed over all other criteria this government may believe that the free market is everything but womens services cant be run in competition they are a basic human right a vital safety net and a literal lifeline for every woman who uses them the government could intervene to support refuges but they chose not to refuges rely on housing benefit to cover a large proportion of their housing costs in some cases over of rent and other eligible service charges but conservative ministers last year announced that this housing benefit would be capped and for months have refused to exclude refuges from this cap despite the fact they take just a tiny fraction of the funding yesterday theresa may signalled they might finally back down on this but people will ask why it has taken so many months for this to happen months in which the uncertainty over funding has already caused big problems for refuges and those who rely on them if the government does go ahead with this cut we will see more refuges closed more lifesaving services decimated and more women left without hope of safety theresa may oversaw the launch of the governments muchlauded violence against women strategy in her time as home secretary but promises made such as a national statement of expectations in which local authorities provide domestic violence refuges are yet to materialise the prime ministers rhetoric might sound good but words dont offer safety to a woman fleeing an abusive partner and they certainly dont prevent the murders of two women

the failure of men to speak out about male violence against women and girls renders us all complicit male violence is a pandemic men were prosecuted for offences against women in britain in a surge of almost over the course of a year these figures are alarming enough but they represent only a sliver of the actual violence abuse and harassment women are subjected to most crimes are not reported it was estimated that million women suffered domestic violence in england and wales in around women are sexually assaulted each year approximately women are raped convictions represent a tiny proportion putting it bluntly the men who commit violence think they are likely to get away with it and devastatingly they are right there are two potential objections to men speaking out about this tidal wave of violence one is that it would be nothing more than socalled virtuesignalling that is men who selfidentify as leftwing demonstrating how right on they are for political brownie points and yes there are such men who exist dubbing themselves a feminist on their twitter profile like teenagers who put badges of bands on their schoolbags the other more compelling argument is that we live in a society where men dominate every pillar of power from parliament to the economy to the media men crowd out the voices of women systematically including on issues that directly affect women no wonder women end up disproportionately affected by policies such as cuts to social security it would be perverse if women did not take the lead in campaigning on violence overwhelmingly committed against them by men so how do men fit in jill robinson is a volunteer with the white ribbon campaign which focuses on encouraging men to campaign against male violence when she was growing up in rural devon in the s she would barricade herself in her bedroom along with her mother to escape the alcoholfuelled rage of her father he didnt believe that women should be educated so she would flee to the fields to study there were no helplines or local refuges when she was young when she did manage to complete her alevels and get a place at university her father was so enraged he told the local community that the real reason his daughter had left was to get an abortion i was just a naive teenager she recalls tearfully why is he doing this its not how fathers should behave she believes men have a responsibility to speak out its tremendously important that everybody speaks up whoever they are she says men should be taking a lead on it the white ribbon campaign was set up years ago because of the huge problem of the massive prevalence of violence by men towards women and what was so striking was the silence of men in relation to that says david bartlett the campaigns director it was as though all these men were committing violence and all these other men were pretending it wasnt going on or it was no concern of theirs men are conditioned from an early age to feel a sense of superiority over women and to objectify women violence against women is the most extreme conclusion of a belief nurtured over thousands of years that women are subservient and exist to satisfy men rape assault and murder exist on a continuum that begins with degrading jokes and comments catcalling in the street images that objectify women the shouting down of women for daring to have an opinion often involving insults about their physical appearance on social media we have a very misogynistic culture in the uk says sam smethers chief executive of the fawcett society we tolerate the casualisation of violence and objectification an atmosphere is produced that makes violence culturally acceptable and men have a responsibility to challenge it although bartlett emphasises that male perpetrators of violence must take responsibility for their actions boys around the world grow up being taught its acceptable they also feel in some ways that its part of what it is to be a man societys reinforcement of what it is to be a man from such a young age damages men too the stereotype assumptions that create violence against women create very narrow expectations of what men should be like says rachel krys codirector of the end violence against women coalition gay bisexual and transgender men or simply men who do not conform to an unreconstructed form of masculinity can also experience violence there are so many practical demands that men should support in a country in which one to two women are killed each week by a current or former partner of refuges have been shut since the tories reentered government six years ago cuts that threaten womens lives must be reversed the fawcett society is calling for male violence against women to be treated as a hate crime an approach now adopted by nottinghamshire police misogynistic hate also intersects with other forms of bigotry take the targeting of muslim women on the streets by white men men have to be sensitive about their role of course as bartlett puts it the approach cannot be as though women havent been talking about it for decades or as though men have something new to say smethers argues it should be in alliance with women and on womens terms it is easy for men to turn away i dont commit this violence im not a perpetrator so why should it concern me why impose collective guilt for the crimes of a minority but it doesnt take much selfreflection to accept that the culture of men into which we are socialised from the day we are born fosters a sense of superiority and dominance we did not invent it but we did inherit it and unless that culture is overcome in favour of a more inclusive form of masculinity male violence against women will continue to be legitimised feminists and lgbt activists have helped to redefine masculinity in a way that is more accepting and less about dominance but there is still so far to go and if male violence is to be overcome men have a duty to listen to women and to speak out,2016-09,failure men speak male violence woman girl render u complicit male violence pandemic men prosecuted offence woman britain surge almost course year figure alarming enough represent sliver

today is equal pay day it marks the amount of extra time since the end of the financial year it has taken women to earn the same amount as men based on australias gender pay gap of this year it took women an extra days to catch up as a society we havent made much headway in closing the gender pay gap which has hovered between and for decades its been over years since the sex discrimination act made it illegal to pay a woman less than her male counterparts for the same work since then weve seen the fall of the berlin wall the end of apartheid and australias first female prime minister yet the gender pay gap persists the gender pay gap is currently as calculated by the abs that number is based on a comparison of the full timeequivalent earnings of men and women taking part time work into account a few factors help to explain it including a lack of women in senior positions differences in education and experience and old fashioned discrimination geography plays a role pay is more equal in the act where the pay gap is than in western australia where its the pay gap differs between industries as well for instance its much worse in finance than in retail a more complex obstacle is the fact that some industries and occupations are simply paid more historically femaledominated industries such as teaching or social assistance have been paid less than male dominated ones like mining or banking australia has some of the worlds best data on pay equity collected by the workplace gender equality agency wgea that data has already shown that when bonuses superannuation and other perks are taken into account the pay gap rises to there is currently little reliable data in australia about the pay gap for women of colour or women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds overseas evidence suggests the pay gap for those women is much worse we do know that for indigenous women data from shows that the pay gap is around the university of queensland womens collective illustrated this earlier this year with their feminist week gender pay gap bake sale which charged students differently based on their statistically likely future earnings these issues may seem intractable but the greens have a simple proposal to make a start abolish pay gag clauses last week i reintroduced a bill to make sure workers cant be punished for talking to each other about their pay we know that one of the best ways to end inequality is to throw light on it our bill will ban pay gag clauses and make existing gag clauses unenforceable it would make sure that workers are allowed to tell their colleagues what they are paid if they wish to without fear of retaliation from their boss the proposed new law would not force anyone to discuss their pay but it would make sure that bosses could not pressure their employees to stay quiet i experienced this first hand in my very first job at a commercial law firm where the guy sitting next to me was earning more than i was we were doing exactly the same job and we had equal experience since we were both fresh out of university where i had got better marks than him i never would have guessed there was any difference in our pay unless hed let his salary slip in a casual conversation evidence has shown that pay secrecy can help hide discrimination unconscious bias and bad decision making such as where two people are paid differently for doing the same job pay transparency makes sure employers have to justify pay decisions when pay is set in secret by individual negotiation women are at a disadvantage research suggests that women are less likely to ask for a raise or negotiate aggressively and are more likely to be judged unfairly by managers our proposal to allow workers to speak freely has already gained support from academics lawyers and unions and im looking forward to putting the case strongly for reform all sides of politics say they care about pay equity in the coming months a senate committee will conduct an inquiry into the bill this is an opportunity for our leaders and particularly our women leaders to come together and start to eliminate this inequality we can and will disagree on other aspects of fixing the gender pay gap like the need to increase government funding for higher pay in childcare aged care and teaching regardless of those differences we should be able to come together

many believe the stereotype that men and women approach salary negotiations very differently the conventional wisdom is that after only a few months on the job men will waltz into their bosss office unannounced slam their fist of the table and demand more money this chutzpah of course results in a raise meanwhile women who have worked for years at the same company still feel undeserving of a salary topup i dont want to come across as entitled they say to each other wistfully over crantinis i still have so much to learn misogynists use the above scenario to illustrate why women themselves are to blame for the pay gap chicks earn less than men because theyre afraid to speak up theyll say thankfully a recent study that uses data from australian workers disproves that faulty logic researchers from universities in the us and uk found that both genders ask for pay raises with the same frequency thats right women earn less because of good ol fashioned discrimination its no surprise since for most of history work cultures were created by men to help other men advance the pay gap will only close once companies become environments that cater more to the female sex in popular culture and actual workplaces men still hold the majority of powerful positions donald draper francis underwood tony soprano in corporate america less than of the top leadership roles are held by women and of members in the us congress members are male that degree of industry dominance leads to discrimination against women particularly women of color that manifests in notsosubtle ways supposed feminine qualities such as collaboration empathy and selfdoubt are seen as weaknesses despite research that shows they motivate employees the result is that many females feel they must act more like powerful men to succeed around of senior women take on masculine characteristics to get ahead according to uk telecommunications firm o yet the last thing this world needs is more megalomaniacs who think their authoritative demeanour makes them fit to run a country or a company in addition to behavioural discrimination theres a larger structural imbalance that explains why women earn less than men they are still the primary caregivers for children and parents even though fewer women are fulltime housewives their home responsibilities have a tangible effect on their careers in a previous column ive cited the research by economist and harvard professor claudia goldin who found the best explanation for the pay gap is that a decade into their careers many women will take less prestigious jobs that allow for more flexible work hours when women then have children or again are caring for their own parents or other sick family members who need care then they need to work differently writes scholar annemarie slaughter in her book titled unfinished business they need to work flexibility and often go parttime so rather than become partner at a big criminal law firm a job that doesnt easily allow for pm daycare pickups many women selfdemote themselves to smaller firms or parttime work because of their home life responsibilities many mothers and caretakers dont have the luxury of taking the highpaying jobs which would help close the pay gap the idea that women make less because they are reluctant to ask for more money is an antifeminist fallacy female employees are repeatedly disadvantaged in a workplace that still equates masculinity with competence and a society that expects them to prioritize their families over leadership positions companies can help shrink the gap with workfromhome policies and a culture that evaluates staff based on their results rather than the amount of hours they put in and more men can take on caregiving duties so their female partners can both be mothers and focus on professional success,2016-09,many believe stereotype men woman approach salary negotiation differently conventional wisdom month job men waltz

the government has announced it will make it easier for people to register to vote anonymously a change for which charities working with women who have experienced domestic abuse have long campaigned the charities argue that while it can be vital for women who have escaped violent relationships to conceal their whereabouts the current hurdles for being allowed to remain off the public electoral roll are very high those seeking to register anonymously have to present either a court order or other legal document or a letter from a senior police officer or another very highranking official the constitution minister chris skidmore told parliament on wednesday that the government would look at simplifying the qualifying evidence necessary to register anonymously before the statement skidmores department the cabinet office said that as well as for those who had experienced domestic abuse anonymous registration could be necessary for those at risk of forced marriage witnesses in some criminal cases or people vulnerable for other reasons if their name and address could be accessed skidmore said this government wants everyones voice to be heard and ensure anonymous registration is accessible to those who are some of the most vulnerable but also the bravest in society the changes were sought primarily by womens aid sian hawkins campaigns manager for the charity said that for women living in a refuge it was currently an almost insurmountable challenge to register to vote to remain off the public register they must currently provide either a court order or the signature of a police officer of superintendent rank or above or the head of the national crime agency or a director of social services these are not the kind of people that survivors of domestic abuse come into contact with in everyday life hawkins said adding that the evidence must be resubmitted every year its safe to assume that many many survivors of domestic abuse will currently not be able to take part in the democratic process womens aid has recommended that the permitted signatories for letters asking for people to register anonymously be expanded to include the likes of refuge managers gps health visitors and midwives hawkins said the charity was extremely pleased that the government was taking action its absolutely critical that survivors of domestic abuse have the same right to the democratic process as everybody else particularly after being so often disenfranchised by the system in many other ways said said the government action was also praised by mehala osborne who launched a petition for a change to the rules in association with the campaign group degrees after she found herself unable to register anonymously while living at a refuge in bristol when i was left unable to

male violence against women is both a cause and a consequence of gender inequality in this country and across the world it is right and essential that official bodies strive to reduce and eliminate such offences as an end in itself and as part of a broader strategy to combat genderbased injustice the crown prosecution service has just published its annual performance review titled violence against women and girls crime report this year for the first time tucked away in parentheses on the front page are seven new words inclusive of data on men and boys readers might wonder how crimes against women and girls can include men and boys the answer lies in a curiously bureaucratic definition violence against women and girls vawg doesnt necessarily mean violence against women and girls it means a subset of criminal offences that have been categorised as vawg crimes rape and sexual assault domestic violence human trafficking forced marriage etc and the victims of these crimes are not all female as the introduction makes clear one in six victims described in the report are in fact men and boys in the largest category domestic abuse exactly of victims where gender was recorded are male elsewhere the figures are higher almost a quarter of victims of socalled honour crimes are male and in the category of trafficking and prostitution a full of victims are men and boys but it is in the most sensitive areas of sexual violence and child abuse where the situation is most troubling here the cpss data collection is so inadequate that it is impossible to officially state the gender ratio of victims they are simply assumed to be female in fact the limited data that is available in the appendix shows one in eight rape victims and more than a quarter of child abuse victims to be male those who work with male survivors of these crimes testify that issues of gender and sexuality are often central to trauma and recovery with survivors dealing with a sense of emasculation or isolation feeling that due to being the wrong gender they barely exist as victims it is not difficult to see how government bodies categorising these often young and deeply vulnerable men as women and girls is tantamount to another abusive act furthermore male survivors charities and campaigns are desperately frustrated by the lack of reliable data which they urgently need to make a fair and compelling case for funding support and donations these issues are not restricted to the crown prosecution service as we have been reminded just this week services to address violence against women are in crisis one of the few lifelines is the governments violence against women fund worth m over five years every penny and then some is desperately needed by womens organisations and yet when charities working with male survivors of rape or domestic abuse need their own support this is the fund to which they are told to apply this is abhorrent it takes precious funding away from womens causes and it makes male survivors invisible treating them as an afterthought or an irrelevance perhaps worst of all it pits male and female survivors against each other in an ignominious competition for funding there might be a temptation for some to simply strip away the gender politics from intimate crimes to describe them and address them as genderneutral or even genderfree from discussions with friends and colleagues in both the mens and womens sectors it is clear this is something almost nobody wants just as there is a political and social context to violence against women and girls there is a different but no less relevant context to intimate violence against men male victims have genderspecific issues and needs that can be fundamentally different to those of women no one is helped by ignoring or wishing those contexts away in recent years mens charities have begun to refer increasingly to genderinclusive policies meaning policies that acknowledge and address the relevant gender issues in both survivor support and reduction strategies government bodies need to learn that just tacking men and boys on to womens issues like an awkward appendix is the polar opposite of a genuinely genderinclusive approach it is good and necessary that government bodies quantify and describe violence against women and girls accurately and fully efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate such crimes should be assisted and applauded these efforts are hindered not helped by clumsily bundling men and boys into the statistics and the strategies male survivors are entitled to recognition and support of their own those men and boys and their representatives in campaigns and charities did not ask to be treated like this they were not consulted on this did not consent to this and have repeatedly pleaded with government bodies not to treat them in this way to continue to do so is contemptible and cruel,2016-09,male violence woman cause consequence gender inequality country

its always there isnt it most of us dont like it but what can we actually do about genderbased violence sure the figures are terrible violent crimes against women in england and wales reached record levels last year but theyve been going up for ages rape and domestic violence are the new poor always with us no matter how much we wish it were otherwise if that sounds cynical its because im sick of a glaring disconnect at the heart of our culture the criminal justice system is struggling to cope with the number of women coming forward with terrible stories of rape beatings and a relatively new one this online forms of abuse such as revenge porn the annual report of the director of public prosecutions alison saunders told exactly this story when it was published earlier this week offences against women including domestic abuse rape and sexual assault rose by almost in stalking prosecutions were up by child sex prosecutions by and there were a record number of rape prosecutions cue a great deal of handwringing and a weary sense that perhaps violence against women while regrettable is inevitable just think of all the training initiatives and public awareness work thats been done in recent years yet the picture just keeps on getting worse is there really anything that someone police prosecutors legislators hasnt already thought of and tried there is but it requires a dramatic shift in public attitudes how many times have you heard people express sympathy with a man on trial for rape asking why the victim had had so much to drink or agreed to go back to his hotel room public understanding of the law relating to consent is woefully lacking and there is a persistent tendency to view womens behaviour much more critically than that of the men who commit even violent assaults the same unthinking callousness is shown to victims of domestic abuse who are often criticised for staying with violent partners even when they have nowhere else to live there are nothing like enough safe places for victims a situation thats going to get even worse when a housing benefit cap hits refuges in if we are to change the dire situation revealed in annual crime statistics there has to be an end to a culture of suspicion denial and victimblaming sometimes i think were making progress but every apparent advance is quickly followed by a return to the status quo three months ago after the horrific killing of the labour mp jo cox there was an outpouring of shock and sympathy that consensus didnt last long when other female labour mps talked publicly about receiving rape and death threats some people went on social networking sites to mock them they even laughed at jess phillips when she posted photographs of a locksmith fixing stronger locks at the home she shares with her children the attitude that being threatened with sexual violence is just another hazard of the job seems to be widely held with the labour leader jeremy corbyn telling his female colleagues to ignore it when even the leader of the opposition cannot correctly identify a genderspecific form of abuse we have reached a startling level of denial but that is exactly where we are as i was reminded on the sunday morning after coxs killing part in a bbc tv programme that began by discussing the attack on cox and then moved on to a call by several public figures including sir cliff richard for anonymity for men accused of serious sexual offences another of the guests immediately began to talk about false rape accusations as though the biggest problem we face is the number of men being wrongly accused this claim was debunked by research published by keir starmer saunderss predecessor as dpp yet in no time at all we had moved from talking about women as victims of horrendous violence to the idea that they make untrustworthy witnesses there is nothing unusual about that sadly but such assumptions cannot be ignored when we look at the shockingly low rate of convictions in rape cases according to the dpps latest report just over half of rape prosecutions ended in a conviction last year that means that fewer than men were found guilty in the whole of england and wales yet almost women reported rapes to the police in london alone the vast majority are telling the truth but few will ever see their attacker in a courtroom violence against women is at epidemic proportions some of it is driven by technology but the biggest problem by far is tolerance a society genuinely committed to gender equality wouldnt put up with this situation for a moment,2016-09,always isnt u dont like actually genderbased violence sure figure terrible violent crime woman england wale reached record level last year theyve going age rape domestic violence new

phyllis schlafly believed feminism was a losing battle the conservative icon who died on monday aged insisted that the movement for gender equality was a fight with human nature and therefore doomed to fail women belonged in the home she believed men belonged in the workforce and women didnt need any more rights than the ones they were already afforded but despite schlaflys predictions and beliefs the world she left behind this week is one that largely embraces the issues she most feared feminism is more popular than ever women are in the workforce en masse lgbt rights are front and center and the country is mostly prochoice it turns out human nature is more attached to social progress than it is the idea that women belong in the kitchen and with schlaflys death were witnessing the end of a particular brand of conservative antifeminism that simply cant survive in a country that has moved well beyond its values schlafly spent decades painting feminism as a war against men and traditional gender roles she also insisted that virtuous women arent sexually harassed and that there was no such thing as marital rape during a talk to students at bates college she said by getting married the woman has consented to sex and i dont think you can call it rape she said this in by the way not to conservatives she was a breath of fresh feminine air proof that women didnt really want equality after all to feminists she was the worst kind of hypocrite a person who claimed womens place was in the home while she herself traveled the country giving speeches and published more than books but her national profile and inarguable successes the most famous of which was her campaign in the s to block the passage of the equal rights amendment simply couldnt stop progress schlaflys argument against the era for example was that it would mean the legalization of homosexual marriage women in combat unisex bathrooms and public funding of abortion today even without the amendment samesex marriage is legal women can serve on the front lines bathroom laws are shifting and a selfidentified feminist who wants to overturn the hyde amendment is running for president in fact schlafly died on the st anniversary of hillary clintons womens rights are human rights speech before she passed schlafly threw her support behind donald trump saying at a march rally weve been following the losers for so long now weve got a guy whos going to lead us to victory her book the conservative case for trump comes out on wednesday schlaflys endorsement was an anomaly among conservative womens organizations which have mostly been disdainful or silent on trumps run that schlaflys last political act was supporting a candidate whose disdain for women borders on the psychotic seems appropriate as does trumps statement that schlafly was a champion for women though schlaflys fight for an america that doesnt exist anymore has come to an end her fellow conservatives will surely rage on but just

it is better sometimes not to know certain statistics or pretend perhaps that they dont exist on average two woman in england and wales are killed each week by a current or former male partner that is someone who loves them or has claimed to in the past an incident of domestic violence is reported to the police every minute according to womens aid on average a women experiences incidents of domestic violence before ever going to the police there are more horrifying figures about the number of young children who witness this or the number of young women who now think that being hit by their boyfriends is simply part of a normal relationship an epidemic of violence against women is the backdrop to how we live sticking the word domestic in front of the word violence does not make this a private or personalised matter it is a social evil and yes there are male victims too the labour mp jess phillps rose in the house of commons on international womens day to read out the names of the women who had been killed in the past year explaining in a woman was murdered in the uk every three days the house was sombre yvette cooper has also campaigned tirelessly on the issue telling theresa may when she was home secretary that she needed to do more may then told the police federation that it was letting down victims because of the falling numbers of prosecutions and convictions instead community resolutions are being used to settle domestic violence cases out of court this means that violence against women is being put on a par with small thefts and vandalism it may end up with the police taking the abuser home to apologise refuges exist so that women and children can get away from such apologies they provide shelter and support for women to help rebuild their lives right now twothirds of those in england are under threat of closure because of changes to the way housing benefit is paid there have been warnings of this situation since george osbornes last autumn statement the sector is already underresourced and is hardly considered a sexy kind of charity since of refuges have been cut there has not been a cut in violence far from it so while we have had more legislation around coercive and controlling behaviour there are fewer places for women to turn to in a crisis refuges offer more than shelter they also help women to get out of a pattern of bad relationships and make new lives currently the department for work and pensions is deferring the reform until to conduct a review into funding for such supported housing womens aid relies on this housing benefit and cannot function without it there is no sign that violence against women is being deferred and the police are overwhelmed at the amount being reported if we consider women and children to be human then this is surely a human rights issue as julie walters patron of womens aid says refuges save lives its as simple as that does the government want to live with consequences of

one of the countrys biggest childcare charities which provided thousands of lowincome families with nursery afterschool clubs and parenting services has collapsed children which was the governments official early years strategic partner went into administration after a rapid corporate expansion fuelled by private loans unravelled in the face of government cuts charity leaders blamed the collapse of children a respected and nationally recognised charity on an increasingly tight financial environment for charities delivering councilfunded services and described it as a a warning sign to ministers about the sustainability of childrens services in a competitive public sector marketplace kathy evans the chief executive of children england which represents childrens charities said the closure of one of the sectors biggest names had surprised many she said the serious financial fragility of the childrens services marketplace is a very real and urgent problem for large and small organisations alike imelda redmond who was brought into children as chief executive just over a year ago said that although massive financial losses had been brought under control in recent months the board felt the charity was not viable in the long term when we looked at the horizon it looked too precarious she said the rapid expansion of children was overseen by redmonds predecessor anne longfield who left months ago after being appointed childrens commissioner for england by the former education secretary nicky morgan longfield said in a statement on friday when i handed over the reins of children after over years leading it alongside an extraordinarily committed group of trustees i considered it to be in good shape with a positive future ahead times are tough for charities though and its right that they work together and merge services so that they minimise risk and reduce back office spend in order to provide the best possible support in as costeffective a way as possible and i understand their decision to do this the closure will come as a blow to the government which needs a stable childcare market to help deliver its employment and poverty agenda ministers have promised to double free childcare from to hours for working parents of three and fouryearolds from however critics warn that childcare providers cannot afford to take on the extra demand neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance said the collapse of children should serve as a stark reminder to government of what can happen when childcare providers are no longer able to remain financially sustainable a challenge facing many large and small across the country due to a continued lack of adequate funding redmond said the impact of the closure this week was softened by a decision taken four months ago to wind down the charity in an orderly way and arrange for other organisations to take on its contracts a process overseen by the dfe as a result all but three of its different sites had moved into new ownership last week reducing disruption to families and minimising the number of redundancies of children staff have lost their jobs as a direct result of the collapse the charity action for children has taken on the bulk of the contracts which are mainly let by local authorities other services have been moved back under council control however the news came as a shock to parents and angry messages were left on the charitys website after families arrived at centres last week to find the doors locked one parent said you havent given my girls a chance to say goodbye they will never understand why they cannot return to their nursery a place they felt so happy in fact i cannot think of a more disruptive unsettling and hurtful way you could have done this all but one of those services have since found new owners and will reopen from monday a spokesperson for the department for education dfe which had funded children to the tune of over m during the past five years said we are working closely with children and action for children to make sure that disruption is minimised for children and families we are confident that action for children will successfully deliver our work with the early years sector and no public money will be lost as a result of this transition action for childrens managing director of operations carol iddon said changes required to sustain the services in future included the possibility of introducing or raising childcare charges she said that although action for children was confident it could make the services viable there could be no longterm guarantees its a competitive market and challenging market and children were not the only charity facing these kinds of challenges she added the demise of children follows the highprofile closures of kids company and the adoption charity baaf in august questions are being asked about the suitability of private finance in a market where council childcare spending has been cut so deeply that charities are unable to make a sufficient financial margin to repay interest on loans despite ratcheting down costs and wages and making widespread use of zerohours contracts for staff children embarked on its rapid expansion plan under longfield in more than doubling income to m within four years after an aggressive pursuit of council contracts it went hellforleather they were not marketaverse they had a capitalist view of how to do business one sector insider told the guardian in october it raised m in loans to fund the plan including from big society capital the body set up by former prime minister david cameron to encourage charities delivering public services to adopt a more commercial and businesslike approach to capital funding hsbc bank loaned m to children as part of the deal which was brokered by fse group it was trumpeted at the time as a way of attracting investment into charities normally unable to secure private finance fse said the loans would promote a financially sustainable future for the charity children declared soon after that it was now considered as the preeminent childrens charity within months however longfield had left to become childrens commissioner and the charity admitted in its annual accounts for the year to the end of march that its financial performance was not satisfactory it had run up a m loss on income of m and drained its financial reserves economic conditions continue to be difficult and we have not responded as well as we would have liked to that environment particularly in not making the savings required in delivering and supporting our services it said cliff prior chief executive of big society capital said since big society capital has made investments working with our fund managers and coinvestors to bring more than m to over charities and social enterprises unfortunately not all of these organisations are successful we always explore how we can learn from failures

twothirds of womens refuges in england are facing closure due to a change in the way housing benefit is paid to supported and sheltered housing according to the national domestic abuse charity womens aid government plans to cap housing benefit in the social sector at the same levels paid to private landlords risks destroying the finances of the refuges which take in women and their children who have been victims of violence at the hands of their partners the charity says a survey of womens aidaffiliated refuges shows that of those operating in england would be forced to close if they are not exempted from the reform while would be forced to scale down the support they give to families polly neate the chief executive of womens aid said refuges provide specialist support to help women and their children truly recover from domestic abuse and rebuild their lives with a view to longterm independence these women and children have been through enough and they deserve better than services which are continually on the brink of closure the warning comes after plans were revealed in former chancellor george osbornes autumn statement last november to cap the amount of rent housing benefit would cover in the social sector to the same level offered to private landlords in the same area womens aid said in the case of one english refuge this would slash its income from about to just per room per week some refuges cover of their costs from housing benefit the charity said a spokeswoman said it would more than reverse m worth of government support for the sector promised after the closure of of refuges since sparked a major outcry sue cox the manager of a womens refuge in wiltshire said the money went towards providing security and specialist support to women and their children who often faced problems that went well beyond domestic violence she said antisocial behaviour drinking making bad choices of friends and relationships these things all play out in refuges and work has to be done to ensure that they are able to hold down a tenancy after the refuge cox said specialists were on hand hours a day in the refuge she managed and had to be in order to ensure the safety of the women staying there if we are only there for an hour a day it is very likely that those families will struggle and those issues will still be an issue she said the department for work and pensions said a deferral to the reforms until would give womens refuges a period of grace while officials conduct a review into funding for the supported housing sector however sources within the social housing sector have said the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the review was affecting providers now supported housing providers which also include organisations providing specialised accommodation for elderly and disabled people were unable to plan for the future without knowing where their money would come from according to the national housing federation which represents social housing providers building work on an estimated new specialist homes has already been cancelled as a result and an additional homes would not be able to be built if the housing benefit cap went ahead julie walters patron of womens aid england said refuges save lives it is as simple as that the government must exempt them from these welfare reforms or live with the consequences of more women being killed and more families traumatised by domestic abuse domestic abuse is a human rights issue and women and children need the specialist support that refuges provide to reclaim their dignity and strength a dwp spokesman said we fully support the valuable work carried out by domestic abuse refuges and other supported accommodation providers that is why we deferred this measure for this sector while we conduct a review to ensure it is sustainable in the long term we will continue working with providers to ensure the right protections are in place and will set out our plans in the

working parents with very young children could struggle to find nursery places as government plans to double the amount of free childcare for older children aged three and four are expected to lead to a surge in demand for already limited places according to the preschool learning alliance pla the body representing many of the nursery providers those parents who manage to secure a place for their children aged under two will probably have to pay more for the privilege neil leitch the chief executive of the pla which represents nurseries said rising business costs mortgages and rents insurance utilities and the introduction of the national living wage were already putting significant pressure on early years providers these problems would be exacerbated when the amount of free childcare for children aged three and four was doubled to hours a week next year leitch said there is no doubt that the introduction of hours of free childcare for three and fouryearolds will have an impact on the availability of places for one and twoyearolds he said twoyearolds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are already struggling to access places in many areas this situation is likely to worsen when the hour scheme is fully rolled out next year government figures suggest that almost children aged under two are in full daycare in england and wales around others attend nurseries in some form during the year concerns that the sector is on the brink of a financial crisis were heightened last week after figures revealed that the number of nurseries forced to close had almost doubled in the past year accountancy group moore stephens said nurseries had become insolvent in england and wales last year compared with in a rise of the government has begun piloting the hour free childcare provision at a number of locations nurseries will be paid an average of an hour for every child aged three or four that they take but some nurseries are opting out because they say they cannot make it work financially a recent survey revealed that half are unsure whether they will offer the extended entitlement with a further having ruled it out a recent report by parliaments public accounts committee found that many private and voluntary providers claim the amount they currently receive for providing free childcare is not enough to cover their costs to make up the shortfall they charge parents for additional hours or seek other sources of income but this would be jeopardised if they choose to offer the full hours of free childcare the report states there is a risk that providers who can choose whether or not to offer parents free childcare will choose not to offer the new entitlement of a further hours because doing so would reduce their opportunity to charge parents for hours outside of the entitlement nurseries will also look to plug the funding gap by charging more for the places they offer to the youngest children the pla believes moore stephens research has found that younger children place greater financial demands on the nursery system the average hourly cost of caring for a twoyearold is compared with for a child aged three or four the extended scheme is likely to see childcare costs for parents of younger children rise leitch said at the moment many providers are forced to charge parents of three and fouryearolds higher fees for any additional hours they take up over and above the free entitlement once the hour offer is introduced however many parents will solely be taking up governmentfunded hours meaning providers may well end up having to charge more for one and twoyearold places in order to plug this gap a spokesman for the department for education said it had received huge demand from local areas keen to take part in the pilots we are doubling our free childcare offer for working parents to make it easier for them to get on and balance work with their family lives we will be spending a record bn on childcare by the end of this parliament and recently published plans for a fairer funding system for nurseries and preschools which received widespread support said the spokesman however leitch said the plans did not address the key issue there isnt enough in the funding pot to begin with ultimately if the government doesnt take action it is those parents with younger children who are likely to end up paying the price,2016-09,working parent

i am and my parents who have been married for years split up earlier this year i started to suspect that my dad was seeing somebody else he had an extramarital affair some years ago a few weeks after the split i asked to meet him with the intention of questioning him until he admitted what i already knew i was right he was seeing somebody else he was and still is adamant that he had not cheated on my mother he claims to have met this woman just days after the breakup i was devastated and heartbroken that he had not allowed my mother or his children the time to come to terms with the dissolution of their marriage we are a very close family who have a lot of fun together so not only were we having to deal with the sadness and heartbreak that the tightknit unit had come to an end but had to come to terms with my father caring more about himself than anyone else my mother is in pieces and reminds me on a weekly basis that she is lonely and has been left alone i try to see her as often as i can but it is taking its toll i am trying to build a career save to get on the property ladder maintain a relationship with my partner and still have some time for a social life i feel guilty every day that she feels so alone while my father flaunts his new girlfriend in front of her sending my mother texts clearly meant for his new girlfriend and boasting about their most recent holiday together if he is telling the truth and has only been with his girlfriend since a few months ago he has committed his entire life savings to a relationship of only just under six months they are moving into a house together paid for out of the divorce despite knowing each other for such a short time i am hurt that he is throwing the money he earned with my mother at somebody who doesnt deserve it at all i cut your longer letter which was full of sadness and anger i really feel for you to have your family broken up like that when you felt you were very close is hard however you have the narrative already in your head your poor mother your bad father the evil new girlfriend to move you on from this position you need to reevaluate what you think you know if you read back your language talking about your father its quite telling i asked to meet him with the intention of questioning him until he admitted what i already knew if you only determine to find out what you already know you learn nothing new your parents marriage did not dissolve overnight i know it must seem like that but it didnt you seem in your longer letter quite fixated on the timings of things when your mum told you when your dad met his girlfriend etc this grasping at a timeline is what we do when we are trying to make sense of something we find unfathomable ultimately it doesnt matter what does is what you are left with now and how you move on you can be as angry with your dad as you like but you may want to question why all the anger is aimed at him it is very easy to demonise the one who left who had the affair but your mother would have played her part in the marriage and its demise to think anything else is really rendering your mother down to just a passenger in her own life with no thoughts or actions is that fair you can rebuild your relationship with your imperfect dad out of everything youve told me hes done the one detail i found hardest to understand was that he had sent texts in error to your mum that were meant for his girlfriend i wondered also how you know this that seems really cruel and if i were your mum i would just block his number for a while and ask him to only communicate via phone call or letter for the time being you are not responsible for your mums current loneliness try not to feel guilty that she feels so alone its not down to you sure tell her about things that are going on invite her to events but ultimately she has to move herself on and fill her own life you cant do it for her is your mum allowed a new boyfriend how would you feel whenif she meets someone else and why is it different for your dad is it because you dont believe he met his girlfriend after the split is it that you wanted him to be single for longer your life sounds full which is great so often when children are overinvolved in their parents lives it is because their own hasnt developed fully but your life sounds busy and fulfilling i would take a step back at this point let your parents get on with things and allow yourself the luxury of dealing with just your own feelings for a while and no you dont have to forge a new relationship with your dads new girlfriend yet but do get to know her in time as the person she is not what she represents your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the guardian kings place york way london n gu or

the federal government has reversed its decision to cancel a discussion about family violence during a meeting with state and territory counterparts in december with a communique signed off by the prime minister malcolm turnbull confirming family violence is on the agenda in a council of australian governments communique released on friday afternoon after a domestic violence summit in brisbane turnbull and state leaders all agreed that leaders would formally discuss family violence at the december meeting it was also agreed that victoria which held australias first royal commission into family violence would bring the coag paper the first time in many years the commonwealth has agreed to allow a state to bring forward its own submission coag will also consider introducing a medicare item subsidy specifically for family violence counselling despite the idea from victorias royal commission into family violence being rejected by the federal health minister sussan ley earlier this week ley had written that there were a range of medicare items including gp allied health and specialist items that could already be used to claim family violence counselling and said individual state and territory governments could consider providing additional services to complement the existing medicare items speaking to reporters after the domestic violence summit andrews said he was pleased the medicare item for family violence counselling was back on the agenda the commonwealth state and territory governments needed common laws common practice and common leadership on family violence there is fair degree of support for us to continue the discussion around standardised leave in the national employment standards our courts working better together child protection working better together but also using one of the great platforms in the world in terms of the universal provision of healthcare medicare to better provide for those who are dealing with family violence he said at the end of the summit coag launched the third part of the national plan to reduce violence against women and their children according to coags communique the third plan would see a more intense focus on prevention and early intervention aboriginal and torres strait islander women and their children sexual violence responding to children living with violence and keeping perpetrators accountable the turnbull government also revealed how m in previously promised funding for frontline legal assistance and family law services would be allocated there will be m for a duty lawyer and social services in the family courts and an additional m to pilot family dispute resolution models for vulnerable families there was also m to extend pilot legal assistance programs for another year and was allocated to data analysis in the legal assistance sector but the chief executive of the federation of community legal centres serina mcduff said the allocation fell short of restoring previous federal government cuts and did not address a growing need for family violence and broader legal help five million dollars for community legal centres is not enough to help women escaping violence get the assistance they need to obtain an intervention order or remain safe in their home mcduff said in the face of high and growing need for free legal help with family violence community legal centres nationally face a cut in federal funding next july when they already turn away vulnerable people a year antoinette braybrook the convener of the national family violence prevention legal service forum believed the third plan recognised the need to develop culturally appropriate policies and programs for aboriginal and torres strait islander women and their children it is now time for the turnbull government to match this recognition with tangible action she said access to services and supports is literally a life or death matter for women and children in our community earlier this week the minister for women michaelia cash wrote to the victorian government proposing discussions around family violence be cancelled because there were no matters requiring ministerial decision the letter angered domestic violence groups and the victorian government who had hoped to use the meeting to discuss changing national employment standards to include specific family violence leave victorias premier daniel andrews also wrote to turnbull in august regarding family violence leave but did not receive a response the issues will now be discussed at the next coag meeting,2016-10,federal

british businesses are losing hundreds of millions of pounds every year as a result of women being forced out of jobs after having a baby a damning report from the equalities watchdog has revealed the costs of hiring and training new staff redundancy payouts and lost productivity after women were pushed out of jobs amounted to m a year according to the equality and human rights commission about of women are pushed out of their jobs following maternity leave about women a year but only of these lodge a complaint at an employment tribunal according to the watchdog the cost to british women who were forced out of their jobs either by being dismissed treated so poorly they had to leave or made compulsorily redundant could be as much as m a year according to the report in a report earlier this year the ehrc found that over threequarters of pregnant women and new mothers the equivalent of women experience negative and potentially discriminatory treatment at work each year the report suggested that pregnancy discrimination which is illegal has risen significantly since when of women said they had experienced such discrimination many women who kept their jobs still faced a financial loss costing up to m in total over the year after their return to work as a result of having pay reduced missing out on promotions or receiving a lower pay rise or bonus rebecca hilsenrath chief executive of the ehrc said this is a very important report that shows if you force out a member of your workforce because of pregnancy it actually costs you much more there is not just a moral and legal case for retaining women who are coming back to work but a very strong financial case as well she said that the figures related to the first year after women returning to work faced discrimination but the longer term costs including to the state which were estimated at between m and m were likely to be much greater women working on zerohours contracts and doing agency work were more likely to face discrimination and loss of earnings she said women working in more precarious roles are more likely to lose their jobs as a result of becoming pregnant they are more likely to be held back from reaching their potential and contributing to the economy and that of course costs the state the ehrc said it was working with businesses to promote flexible working and support for parents returning to work citing barclays the royal mail and ford as positive examples it called on the government to extend the time limit for making an employment tribunal claim to six months for cases relating to pregnancy and maternity and examine whether prohibitive costs which have to be paid up front were proving to be a barrier to women getting justice the more people know there is an avenue for redress the more confident they will be in discussing their needs while employers will know they are more likely to be held to account said hilsenrath emma stewart joint chief executive of flexibleworking recruitment firm timewise said all businesses needed to promote flexible working which suited modern families to retain a competitive advantage modern economies need modern workplaces where quality jobs for all are openly advertised to consider flexible working options from the point of hire so that businesses can attract and retain the best possible talent be they parents or not she said the government should give more support for businesses around maternity pay and flexible working said mike cherry national chairman of the federation of small businesses small businesses know the value of supporting their staff boosting morale productivity staff retention and ultimately business success he said adding that fsb research showed of small businesses offer or would consider offering flexible working the selfemployed also need support he said in particular we are campaigning for the maternity allowance to be increased more into line with statutory maternity pay to help our selfemployed members and help ensure fairness in government support i was told you are shit when hannah martin a copywriter in an advertising agency fell pregnant with her first child she worked up to her due date and did not take a day off sick her line manager said she could work one day a week from home but this was never put into writing while i was on maternity leave a number of my projects won prestigious industry awards and i was given an unexpected thank you bonus but on her first day back at work she was told that times had changed and working from home was no longer an option indeed she was warned to be careful because perception is everything in a maledominated environment which combined long work hours with boozy post work sessions martin started leaving work at pm in order to see her baby before bedtime i made sure that all my work was completed by that time and around five months after returning from maternity leave i was given a glowing annual appraisal but a month later she noticed she was no longer being given projects instead her partner was asked to work with an intern who was always happy to work late six weeks later she was called into a meeting with her line manager and the head of hr and told bluntly that she had hours to sign a nondisclosure agreement and leave when i asked why i was told youre shit youve always been shit we have warned you many times it was completely untrue they had never complained about my work although martin sought legal advice and was told she had a strong case for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination she was also told she would have to pay the costs upfront and the case could take a year i was the sole breadwinner at that time and thought it would have made me unemployable in a maledominated industry she says it was very emotional they attack you its like they pull the rug from under your feet so you dont fight back the verbal attack was so strong i hated myself for wanting to cry not from selfpity but from anger i was completely unprepared and totally floored martin left the agency started working freelance and within a month had been hired by a rival firm at a higher salary than she had been on previously who looked at her output not desk time she says my old firm had spent a long time looking for me they paid a high fee to an agent to get me then paid out to get rid of me and they lost a good and loyal employee martin now runs the talented ladies club an online magazine for working mums,2016-10,british business losing hundred million pound every year result

a coalition of alcohol experts including doctors and researchers have accused federal state and territory governments of failing to properly acknowledge the role of alcohol in family violence the council of australian governments twoday summit on family violence will begin on thursday in brisbane prompting the foundation for alcohol research and education to issue a statement of concern among the signatories are family violence experts aboriginal leaders emergency department doctors and alcohol researchers we fear that the forum today and the future discussions will continue to ignore alcohols role in family violence and fail to embrace strategies to address the issue the statement said we know from our research that the role of alcohol in family violence cannot be ignored alcohol contributes to between to of domestic incidents reported to police and between to of child abuse cases reported in australia more than a third of intimatepartner homicides involve alcohol consumption by the perpetrator the foundations chief executive michael thorn said he expected new south wales bureau of crime statistics and research to be released in a few weeks time to show a significant and immediate drop in family violence as a direct result of the states lockout and lastdrinks laws and tightened bottleshop closing hours there dont seem to be any alcohol or mental health experts attending this domestic violence summit even though we know from research their significant contribution to family violence thorn said we suspect the third national family violence plan will be launched at this summit and there has being very little engagement with alcohol experts about that plan so we fear that there is unlikely to be anything of anything substance in that plan in relation to alcohol that can be done to address family violence this included reforming the way alcohol is taxed restricting the sale of alcohol to reduce its availability and tackling the sexualisation of alcohol through advertising he said among the signatories to the statement were professor of social work at the university of melbourne and domestic violence researcher cathy humphreys and the chief executive officer of the central australian aboriginal congress aboriginal corporation donna ah chee the chief executive officer of domestic violence victoria fiona mccormack who was not a signatory to the statement said she would be surprised if governments werent taking the role of alcohol in family violence seriously my experience of the federal government and in fact all governments is that theyre working from the current evidence mccormack said its really important to consider the issue of alcohol and the impact it has and in particular the way it can exacerbate the impact of the

the victorian government and the states peak domestic violence organisation have criticised federal employment minister michaelia cashs decision to cancel a meeting with her state counterparts saying they should use it to discuss the issue of domestic violence leave on october cash who is also the minister for women wrote to state workplace relations ministers proposing cancelling their planned meeting because there were no matters requiring ministerial decision she proposed they meet again in the victorian industrial relations minister natalie hutchins told guardian australia that cashs decision to push off the meeting was either extreme arrogance or extraordinary laziness there are substantial issues that need to be addressed at the national level particularly ensuring family violence leave becomes part of the national employment standards she said the australian council of trade unions actu is currently running a case in the fair work commission to establish the right to days paid domestic violence leave the victorian government has supported the application the federal government has not made submissions the council of australian governments will meet in brisbane on friday to discuss domestic violence but the cancellation of the expected ministers meeting deprives victoria of an opportunity to lobby the federal government over making domestic violence leave a workplace right cash has previously argued that domestic violence leave could provide a perverse disincentive from hiring women an argument that has been used by others against conditions for women like paid maternity leave the community and public sector union has also argued cashs public sector bargaining policy prevents domestic violence leave being inserted into public servants workplace deals because it is considered an enhancement of existing conditions cash has denied the policy amounts to an order to remove domestic violence leave which is currently dealt with either in enterprise agreements or unenforceable workplace policies hutchins said cash should front the meeting and show some national leadership on combatting the biggest social issue we face the domestic violence victoria chief executive fiona mccormack urged cash to strongly reconsider her decision to skip the meeting weve currently got so many workplaces contacting us and saying what can we do to tackle family violence she said im kind of shocked that the federal government wouldnt take up this important opportunity to look at how we can capitalise upon that goodwill currently being shown and opportunities to engage with workplaces about a range of issues including what workplaces can do in preventing violence against women she said the federal government has said over and over that they took family violence seriously this meeting is a tangible and easy way they can discuss the myriad of ways we are working to keep women and children safe at a time where were finally moving away from the idea that this is the role of womens services hutchins questioned why cash didnt care to discuss a range of workplace issues including the federal governments plans to introduce internships that pay extra an hour on top of welfare payments worker exploitation by labour hire companies and the australian building and construction commission legislation hutchins warned the abcc bill and building code would throw construction projects and enterprise agreements into chaos in the federal and state workplace relations ministers had agreed to meet annually but none has so far occurred in in the letter cash justified her decision to cancel the expected meeting by noting there had already been two meetings of senior officials of their departments this year guardian australia has contacted cash

rebekka is so tiny that even on her tiptoes arms aloft she cannot reach so her teacher lifts her up to the unvarnished wooden monkey bar one two three her classmates count she hangs on determinedly when she reaches she jumps to the ground i am strong she shouts proudly its an ordinary morning for this singlesex class of threeyearolds at laufsborg nursery school in reykjavik no dolls or cupcake decorating on the lesson plan here instead as margrt pla lafsdttir the schools founder tells me we are training our girls to use their voice we are training them in physical strength we are training them in courage its a fascinating approach to education and a popular one in a country of only people there are such primary and nursery schools empowering girls from an early age for the past six years iceland has topped the world economic forums gender gap index and looks likely to do so again this week the economist recently named iceland the worlds best place for working women in comparison the uk came in at no lafsdttirs philosophy seems to sit well with the nations progressive accomplishments but her network of schools has been going for less than years so if preschoolers trained in feminism arent the reason for this gender success story what is history may provide us with clues for centuries this seafaring nations women stayed at home as their husbands traversed the oceans without men at home women played the roles of farmer hunter architect builder they managed household finances and were crucial to the countrys ability to prosper by icelandic women were fed up it wasnt just that they werent being properly paid for their labour they also were sick of their lack of political representation only nine women had ever won seats in parliament so against the backdrop of the global feminist movement icelands women decided to take things into their own hands an outpouring of women on to the streets was by then a welltrodden form of activism in tens of thousands of women had protested on fifth avenue in manhattan in the uk that same year women marched in leeds against discriminatory wages but what made icelands day of protest on october so effective was the number of women who participated it was not just the impact of women which at the time was a fifth of the female population that gathered on the streets of reykjavik but the of icelands female population who went on allout professional and domestic strike teachers nurses office workers housewives put down tools and didnt go to work provide childcare or even cook in their kitchens all to prove how indispensable they were thordis loa thorhallsdottir ceo of a tourism company was on the streets that day i was at the time and i remember it very clearly standing there with my mother fighting i can still feel the crowd and the power that was there the big message was that if women dont work the whole community is paralysed the whole society grassroots activism at such a scale unsurprisingly had a significant material impact within five years the country had the worlds first democratically elected female president vigdis finnbogadottir now in her s this steelyeyed powerhouse tells me of the impact that day of protest had on her own career trajectory i would never have been elected in if it hadnt been for the womens day of action because when my predecessor announced that he was not going to stand again the voices were immediately heard now we have to have a woman among the candidates other landmarks soon followed an allfemale political party the womens alliance was established more women were elected to parliament by more than a third of mps were women and then in parental leave legislation came into effect whichevery person i spoke to highlighted this moment as key to icelands march to the top of the genderequality table today every parent receives three months paid leave that is nontransferable parents then have an additional three months to share as they like because the pay is significant of salary up to a ceiling of a month and because its on a useitorloseit basis of icelandic fathers take up their paternal leave this piece of social engineering has had a profound impact on men as well as women not only do women return to work after giving birth faster than before they return to their prechildbirth working hours faster too research shows that after taking the three months leave fathers continue to be significantly more involved in childcare and do more housework sharing the parental responsibilities and chores from the beginning it seems makes a difference its a good place to be a woman says thorhallsdottir and it is almost of icelandic women work thanks to mandatory quotas almost half of board members of listed companies are now women while of icelands university students and of mps are female yet women i met on my journey were also clear that the country has a long way to go they still have less economic power than men only of managers are women only of experts on tv are women and women still earn around less than men icelands record on all of these fronts is better than most countries in the uk womens hourly pay is less than men it is the gender pay gap that puzzles me the most how can it be that it is still so significant given the huge efforts the state has put into mitigating the mummy penalty not only when it comes to parental leave but with heavily subsidised nursery schools and afterschool care explanations vary from women going into less wellpaid professions to the penalty paid for working parttime that weve found in the uk as well to the time it takes for employers implicit gender biases to shift steiney skuladottir one of reykjavkurdtur or the daughters of reykjavik a feminist rap collective who rap about gender issues puts the blame in part on womens reluctance to ask for sufficient pay compensation fellow rapper bloer johanusdottir concurs its like we cant be cocky we are supposed to be modest back at the school lafsdttir has this to say if you are learning from a young age that you are not getting your rightful share if you are taught and trained in waiting what do you expect the icelandic government has pledged to close the gender pay gap by and the women of the country continue to be highly organised and socially aware an astonishing one third of icelands women are members of a facebook group ironically named beauty tips in which they actively discuss gender issues history teaches us that progress doesnt come about in a vacuum and that grassroots pressure plus investment in politics is a very powerful catalyst for change in iceland it seems that they have both in spades noreena hertz is economics editor of itv news her report from

how political are your pubes its not a question most of us spend much time worrying about yet when youre a woman how you choose to cultivate your lady garden sprouts up as a topic with tedious regularity in its latest incarnation the arbiters at tatler magazine have declared the freedom bush back in fashion those who sneer at the notion of the pudenda being subject to changing aesthetic trends would do well to remember that dark midnoughties period the vajazzle years if even the conservative conventional sloane is cultivating a full bush then its worth noting that could indeed hint at a seismic shift in societal norms regarding pubic grooming but equally after years and years of the same debate is it not time that feminist coverage in the media was directed elsewhere in other words magazine editors enough already we are just emerging from a period that has seen a new generation embrace feminism in a way that the capitalist postfeminists of the s could scarcely have imagined much of this has been powerful and positive the conversation about the importance of sexual consent for instance and how it operates within a culture that continues to trivialise rape has never been louder and more energetic the fightback against street harassment has been equally inspirational but at the same time a strand of feminism in the media has spent the last few years concerning itself with issues that many would dismiss as trivial including pubes and footwear and shades of grey not to mention that perennial question that birthed a million opeds is beyonc a feminist or not as a writer i have been guilty of entering into some of these debates with an internet media run on opinion feminist polemic can feel like one of the few journalistic avenues open to the young aspiring woman writer critiquing media sexism is how i began my own career and i am grateful to it but i have said my piece on womens magazines for a long while talking about the more trivial aspects of the feminist debate as opposed to for instance boring old domestic violence was the only way to get feminism covered in the mainstream media but as time has gone on the focus on the fluffy so often to the point where it appears to be given equal billing to more urgent and distressing issues affecting women has irked me and other feminists writers more and more perhaps it is because i have been in this game for a while now and have thus seen the same topics recycled several times over with very little new being said my friend and colleague emer otoole wrote the definitive piece on female body hair several years ago what could be left to say about it or perhaps it is because i have grown up a tad in the past five years but more than either of those two things i would reason that this is a time when the need for feminism is making itself acutely obvious in all manner of ways there is so very little to laugh about to the point where even the notion of a freedom foof fails to raise a smile donald trump a man with so much obvious contempt for women that it feels almost unbelievable like watching a fictional dystopia play out on our tv screens is running for president analysis has shown that if women were excluded and only us men were eligible to vote trump would win the election it is abundantly clear that there are millions of people who would rather have a fascist than a female as leader we are told that women can achieve anything in this day and age so what are you whining about being the inevitable subtext look at hillary we are told to which the inevitable rebuttal is yes look at hillary look at what she is up against there are other concerns of course the way the previous sexual behaviour of the complainant in the ched evans case was pored over during his successful appeal and in court this month has caused widespread dismay then theres the closure of domestic violence shelters have closed due to funding cuts of which were specialist services for black and ethnic minority women and of domestic violence services in england said they were running services without any funding two women a week are murdered by their partners or expartners and vulnerable women such as female asylum seekers continue to be abused there were pregnant women held in yarls wood immigration removal centre last year three serco workers are currently in court over the alleged rape of a yarls wood detainee as a recent report noted the harassment and abuse of young girls in schools is endemic i took part in a feminist debate this month during which the broadcaster jenni murray recounted being turned down for a mortgage in the s for no other reason than her gender another speaker spoke about the murder of her friend at by a boyfriend and the dj clara amfo expressed her frustration at being unable to articulate her anger about female oppression without being labelled an angry black woman i returned home depressed and tearful faced with these sobering facts is it any wonder really that so many people seek refuge in arguing instead about bikini waxes ive been to enough schools to talk to young women about feminism to know that feminist fluff can be an easy way to open a discussion a gateway drug if you will for those unfamiliar with the topic or put off or intimidated by the stereotypes surrounding it its important that teenage girls particularly question why it is they feel pressured into certain sexual behaviours that issue does not go away once you declare that the full bush is back the impact of pornography on the way young people conduct relationships goes way beyond a few wax strips taking in issues of consent coercion and abuse objectification grooming and revenge porn its all cheerful stuff the personal is political the feminists of the s told us and this has morphed into a strange kind of choice feminism where women are encouraged to examine their clothing their footwear their grooming their behaviour every little choice that they make in order to assess whether it matches up but the big picture is now so alarmingly vivid that it obscures these trivial questions freedom is never so easy

last week new mothers were told by barbara judge the first female chairman of the institute of directors not to take long maternity leave but to work on and hire a nanny my mother used to say when a baby is born it needs to be fed bathed and diapered she said an yearold girl can do that your job is to get the money to pay the yearold girl when you have to be there is when the child gets smarter than the nanny lady judge said the system in the us where mothers are entitled to only weeks unpaid leave compared to months off and weeks paid leave in the uk helped safeguard womens jobs she herself took just days off work when her son was born the financial drain of employing a nanny is one thing but we shouldnt dismiss the idea out of hand share and care is an organisation which began by matching young people needing somewhere to live with older people who need company now it also matches families with young children or young adults with special needs with people living alone and who want company between them there might be a big difference in age or not these arrangements resemble obviously the family people of different ages and characters sharing their needs and capabilities in dozens of different ways that may even work better than it would with their real kinfolk looked at this way would an yearold nanny really be such a bad addition to childraising im reminded of the old saying god gave us our relations thank god we can choose our own friends what do you think have your say below,2016-10,last week new mother told barbara judge first female chairman institute director take long maternity leave work hire nanny mother used say baby born need fed bathed diapered said yearold girl job get money pay yearold girl child get smarter nanny lady judge said system u mother entitled week unpaid leave compared month week paid leave uk helped safeguard womens job took day work son wa born financial drain employing nanny one thing shouldnt dismiss idea hand share care organisation began matching young people needing somewhere live older people need company also match family young child young adult special need people living alone want company might big difference age arrangement resemble obviously family people different age character sharing need capability dozen different way may even work better would real kinfolk looked way would yearold nanny really bad addition childraising im reminded old saying god gave u relation thank god choose friend think say,"['last', 'week', 'new', 'mother', 'told', 'barbara', 'judge', 'first', 'female', 'chairman', 'institute', 'director', 'take', 'long', 'maternity', 'leave', 'work', 'hire', 'nanny', 'mother', 'used', 'say', 'baby', 'born', 'need', 'fed', 'bathed', 'diapered', 'said', 'yearold', 'girl', 'job', 'get', 'money', 'pay', 'yearold', 'girl', 'child', 'get', 'smarter', 'nanny', 'lady', 'judge', 'said', 'system', 'u', 'mother', 'entitled', 'week', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'compared', 'month', 'week', 'paid', 'leave', 'uk', 'helped', 'safeguard', 'womens', 'job', 'took', 'day', 'work', 'son', 'wa', 'born', 'financial', 'drain', 'employing', 'nanny', 'one', 'thing', 'shouldnt', 'dismiss', 'idea', 'hand', 'share', 'care', 'organisation', 'began', 'matching', 'young', 'people', 'needing', 'somewhere', 'live', 'older', 'people', 'need', 'company', 'also', 'match', 'family', 'young', 'child', 'young', 'adult', 'special', 'need', 'people', 'living', 'alone', 'want', 'company', 'might', 'big', 'difference', 'age', 'arrangement', 'resemble', 'obviously', 'family', 'people', 'different', 'age', 'character', 'sharing', 'need', 'capability', 'dozen', 'different', 'way', 'may', 'even', 'work', 'better', 'would', 'real', 'kinfolk', 'looked', 'way', 'would', 'yearold', 'nanny', 'really', 'bad', 'addition', 'childraising', 'im', 'reminded', 'old', 'saying', 'god', 'gave', 'u', 'relation', 'thank', 'god', 'choose', 'friend', 'think', 'say']",159
i have been in a relationship for about two years with a woman i love and adore and we have lived together for a year i am but there is a big age gap between us she has four adult children who whether by circumstance or choice have problems running their own lives she is constantly running to their rescue and it is taking a big toll on our relationship i knew when i got into a relationship with someone with children my needs would never come first and thats fine but sometimes i want to scream i exist here i am but how can i expect her time and attention when she has a daughter who had a miscarriage or her other daughter who has two children and an abusive boyfriend you are going to tell me to talk to my partner but i cant every time i bring it up she goes on the offensive saying if youre so unhappy just leave i feel as if i am helping pick up the pieces of her childrens lives instead of living my own please help what was really interesting about your letter is that when i first read it i thought you were being a bit selfish how could you complain about not having your partners attention when one of her daughters had had a miscarriage and the other is in an abusive relationship but then unusually i asked you for more information and once i had more details which i cannot publish i realised that far from being selfish you are actually a bit of a saint for putting up with your girlfriends behaviour for this long this skewing of information to your detriment is telling i consulted alison omahony a psychotherapist aftorguk who specialises in blended families and she read both your letters when we compared our notes the very first thing we had both written was why stay you said in your longer second letter to me that when its good its wonderful and i suspect that is what makes you cling on omahony thinks your girlfriend must have a redeeming feature otherwise why put up with it i would have liked to have known more about the wonderful bits because the way your girlfriend talks to you and treats you is not loving at all that is not love i felt there were elements of abusive behaviour from her to you described in your letter and the hanging on for the good bits is rather worrying because that is no way to live omahony asks what is allowing you to stay around and be spoken to and treated like that you mention very little of yourself your family or friends or your upbringing and where you do mention yourself it is in passing yet if i have understood things correctly your girlfriend has moved her daughter and her grandchildren into your home without consulting you and told you that you can basically take it or leave it it sounds as if you have put your life and job on hold yet your girlfriend says she doesnt need you anyway i felt you were like a lens through which i viewed everyone elses life what about you what support do you have family friends work colleagues you mentioned you had no one else to talk to about this and i wonder why that is is there no one else or do you feel ashamed i do hope you are able to bolster your own selfesteem in some way outside this relationship what was your upbringing like what is it about this woman that so hooks you what does it tap into i am all for supporting ones partner and children but as omahony says where is the partner of the daughter who had the miscarriage where is the fathers of these children ie your girlfriends ex or exes why is your girlfriend constantly playing the rescuer to her children i think it is very convenient for your girlfriend to just say if you dont like it you can leave or variations on that theme every time you dare to voice concern or upset it totally shuts you down and doesnt invite a dialogue is this how you want to be spoken to for the rest of your life how would you feel if you saw her talking to someone else probably not overly impressed and yet you take it nothing in your letter made me feel your safety was compromised otherwise i would not recommend this course of action but if you do feel you want to make this work then i would suggest that perhaps during the wonderful times you talk about when things arent so great and how you feel it is tempting to want to talk straight after an argument but this isnt usually the best time so when things are good try asking your girlfriend how she would feel if someone spoke to her children in the way she does to you this isnt actually about your girlfriend having children whom she is putting before you i would understand that this is about your girlfriend treating you badly i cant tell you what to do but i would ask you to think very carefully if the bits that are wonderful where you love and adore your partner are worth the segregation and abuse you get at other times your problems

on friday the state police ministers will meet to finalise the review of the national firearms agreement nfa including the fate of the adler a leveraction shotgun the importance of this meeting should not be underestimated in summary the ministers are deciding the future direction of australias gun laws a future that could see the demise of australias strong gun laws and the continual rise of the progun lobby one issue which the states and commonwealth cannot agree on is the classification of the adler leveraction shotgun to understand the argument surrounding this firearm its important to understand the way firearms have been classified in australia in in response to the port arthur massacre in tasmania where people were shot dead and others were physically injured australia implemented a new firearms licensing system that categorised firearms based on firing action calibre and other criteria the aim of this new firearm licensing system was to restrict civilian access to rapidfire and selfloading firearms these types of firearms can hold a large cache of ammunition and fire that ammunition within a quick time succession for this reason these firearms were and still are the firearms of choice when it comes to gun massacres each jurisdiction recognises five primary categories a b c d and h this licensing system is outlined in a document known as the national firearms agreement nfa in summary category a firearms are the least powerful firearms and have limited firing capacity they include air rifles and single and double barrel shotguns leveraction shotguns fall within this category category b firearms also include some low level repeating firearm category a and b firearms are the most commonly registered firearms in australia and may be owned for a range of sporting recreational hunting and occupational purposes categories c and d include the more powerful firearms and are restricted category c includes semiautomatic and pump action shotguns with a magazine capacity of no more than five rounds these guns are available to primary producers and some sporting shooters category d are prohibited firearms except for official purposes and include selfloading rifle and shotguns and militarystyle firearms with a magazine greater than five rounds so lets get back to the adler in when the nfa was created leveraction shotguns were single barrel and most could only hold one to two rounds of ammunition at any given time the design of the leveraction shotgun has been based on an winchester cowboy gun the lever itself was often found to be quite clunky and difficult to use for these reasons these firearms were placed within category a however years on and the new leveraction shotguns have come a long way they are slicker synthetic hold more ammunition in the magazine the magazine can be easily extended to carry more ammunition and they can propel the ammunition at a much faster rate the only real resemblance to the old leveraction is the fact it has a lever but other than that it could just as well be a pumpaction shotgun which are category c firearms there is no doubt recreational hunters were frustrated and angry with the restrictions imposed upon them by the nfa and there has been a thirst among some to gain access to higher powered firearms firearm suppliers and manufacturers have also been frustrated by the restriction imposed by the australian market and have been trying to find ways to create new demands for firearm ownership so they can sell more of their products one firearm supplier the company nioa which purports to be australias largest privately owned small arms supplier saw the potential for a new leveraction shotgun market a potential to make money from more than category a recreational gun owners across australia a strategy successfully utilised by nioa was to find a way to redesign a category a firearm so that it could have greater firing capacity to garnish this market nioa worked with the turkishowned company adler to design a new leveraction that could hold eight cartridges the gun was promoted by nioa as a game changer for the australian market and more than adlers were preordered although a ban has been placed on the eightshot adler a sixshot adler five in the magazine and one in the chamber has not been banned and nioa currently sells nine different models of adler a to firearms dealers one new model is called the punisher which has a side saddle that holds six extra cartridges the sixshot is now available to all category a firearm licence holders across australia beside it being a new modern leveraction what sets this particular adler lever shotgun apart from other leveractions is the easy ability to remove the magazine and replace it with one that holders even more ammunition on july chris dawson chief executive officer of the australian crime commission prepared a memo warning the minister for justice about this danger concerning the adler dawson warned that with the import of the adler a new magazine extension market will emerge he noted that because of the firearms tubular magazine feature the extension of the magazine is not difficult and requires no specialist gunsmithing skills dawson was not wrong since the government allowed the importation of the sixshot adler in october a new doityourself magazine extension market has emerged which allows owners of the adler a to extend the magazine to up to shots there is no doubt the horse has already bolted as the adler sixshot flows into this country there is the possibility that as i write one is being converted at home into an shot it is with great sadness that i watch australias gun laws wilted away under the watchful eyes of both sides of politics there is a lot that could have been done before now to prevent this situation but there is still a lot that could be done to prevent the situation from worsening ban the eightshot recategorise the

blackclad girls and women downed tools pens and keyboards in argentinas major cities today and took to the streets to demand no more machista violence their strike and demonstration followed similar protests across the region seven of the countries with the highest rate of female murder victims are in latin america where activists say the phenomenon reflects not only high rates of violence social conflict and organised crime but also a cultural strain of aggressive hypermasculinity now people have had enough though there have been powerful womens movements in the region for a long time the campaign against genderbased violence has gathered momentum culminating in the niunamenos not one less movement the symbolic power of so many women standing together proves that focusing on victims does not mean portraying women as passive these protests have given women a name and face and presence in death when their killers and society more broadly objectified or ignored them they have shown that violence is not only the result of inequality and discrimination but also a mechanism perpetuating such problems while the concept of femicide generally understood as the misogynistic or genderrelated killing of women has been particularly resonant in latin america it is employed worldwide last year the united nations special rapporteur on violence against women dubravka imonovi urged all member states to establish a femicide watch and publish the statistics each year the uk already has such a project the volunteerrun femicide census but only because karen ingala smith began tallying deaths independently focusing on femicide must be done with care it is a way of forcing society to confront violence against women not of allowing authorities to ignore anything short of murder both because lowerlevel violence is more prevalent and because men who murder their partners usually have a history of attacking them acknowledging the commonalities is not a reason to ignore social and cultural differences that result in very different patterns of crimes against women in different places such as dowryrelated violence and socalled honour killings and the success of latin american movements in achieving legal change must be set against the difficulties of enforcing those laws and effecting a shift in social attitudes not just prosecuting and punishing genderrelated crimes but preventing them perhaps the movements greatest value has been in making connections that are often overlooked challenging the lines drawn between categories such as domestic and stranger violence and related judgments about the worthiness of victims or the importance of cases the latest protest was sparked by the rape and murder of a schoolgirl but in others marchers have reacted explicitly to attempts to dismiss victims on the basis of factors such as their sexual behaviour not one less schoolgirl but equally not one less sex worker or gang member paradoxically by focusing on the value of each and every womans life the movement turns our attention away from what they have or havent done and towards the actions of violent men which are after all what must change,2016-10,blackclad girl woman downed tool pen keyboard argentina major city today took street demand machista violence strike demonstration followed similar protest across region seven country

andrew jones was shocked when his wife started a child custody battle in the couple had separated five months earlier after he says he caught her in a series of extramarital affairs they had agreed on an informal settlement he moved from their sq ft home into a mobile home paid her a month in child support and could spend equal time with their five and threeyearold kids when he received the letter with a court date jones was not hopeful i felt like i wasnt going to have a life says the yearold who works as an hvac technician i heard so many horror stories of divorce and how pretty much women get all your paycheques and you have no way to live jones his last name was changed to protect the identity of his children represented himself in court while his wife hired an attorney who he says is wellknown in their north carolina county for getting women anything and everything they want in court the attorney he says kind of gives you the feeling that she hates men that all men are dogs and men dont want to be in their childs lives jones nervously told the judge all he wanted was equal time with his kids the following month he received a letter from the court saying he owed a month in child support a payment that would be big stretch on his wage of an hour he had already cleared out his savings to pay off his and his wifes combined debts so to keep up with payments jones sold his truck worth of tools and stopped eating out or having a social life but the money wasnt even the worst part he was only allowed to see his kids eight days out of the month when you have kids it changes your life he says you cant go without them and when you do it wears you down emotionally and physically in family law tales of fathers who pay exorbitant child support and rarely get to see their kids are commonplace recently firms that specialize in mens divorce have popped up all over america to capitalize on socalled genderbased discrimination in courts while many family law firms have seen a drop in divorce filings these niche attorneys claim business is thriving yet their very existence if controversial critics claim any good lawyer is equipped to handle a mans divorce and that instead of pushing for greater equality under the law these firms perpetuate sexist stereotypes about women while family laws are gender neutral theres no doubt that judges and lawyers interpret them based on certain beliefs in many cases judges still consider a woman the more natural caretaker a stubborn holdover from the decades in which mothers only worked at home according to recent census data of mothers have primary custody of their children and collect child support compared with of men the numbers certainly suggest the need for mens divorce attorneys but they lack important context less than of child support cases are actually settled in court which means most parents decide themselves that the mother should be the primary caregiver after all a pew survey shows married women spend twice as much time with their kids than their husbands do but joseph cordell founder of the largest mens divorcefocused firm in america says the stereotypes of mothers as nurturers and men as providers leads to systemic discrimination against fathers as a society weve made progress regarding gender in a number of areas he says but the dark corner of the room when it comes to civil rights i can tell you is dads rights in family courts the most common issues he says are that men rarely get equal access to their children and are often victims of false abuse allegations cordell estimates that of temporary restraining order requests during divorces are mere tactics margaret ryznar an associate law professor at indiana university says her research shows a minority of women seek protective orders during divorce and that since domestic abuse is a hesaid shesaid crime its often impossible to prove whos lying and whos not kirby ingles who lives in missouri says he experienced bias during the custody battle for his fiveyearold son his attorney who did not specialize in mens divorce told him that the court judge would most likely lean towards your exwifes side because the child is five or six years old so needs their mother ingles wanted more custody and joint decisionmaking but was told this is how judges usually rule they didnt really want to do the work and put up a fight and do any digging in the case he says ingles wife got primary custody but he has hired a mens divorce lawyer to renegotiate his child support payments after being hit with a decrease in his salary he says his new advocate is more sincere and compassionate to his needs than a regular family law lawyer and is more equipped to deal with specific issues that affect him such as father alienation but not all experts think mens divorce specialists provide added value ryznar thinks regular family law attorneys are equipped to handle any case and that the niche mens firms are largely a marketing ploy to drum up business many also see an underlying sexism in firms that specialize in fathers rights a flagpole issue of the misogynistic mens rights movement ryznar says that while stayathome moms are less common these days working women still do most of the domestic work which has a negative impact on their salaries courts take into account and compensate mothers for the fact that they took hits to their career to take care of kids she says these mens divorce firms perpetuate the stereotype of a woman whos just after her husbands money that is not true in many real cases but cordell who is a supporter of the mens rights movement finds these arguments absurd he views the treatment of men in divorces as a civil rights issue equating their struggle for equality with that of black people fighting against racism and segregation in the south to suggest to me that guys asking for fairness in family court are guilty of some sort of antifeminist position or sexism is beyond response he says its an insult to guys of course some mens rights attorneys hold less extreme views anne mitchell who opened one of the first fathers rights practices in the s is anti angry mens organizations but says the stereotype that most men want to dodge child support is also not true overwhelmingly guys are not looking for custody or to screw their exes she says theyre just looking to be more involved in their childrens lives than the typical still default schedule every other weekend and one day during the week mitchell who no longer sees clients strove to give fathers a reality check about which legal battles were worth fighting as a society we have really come to demonize men theres just definitely a faction that believes all boys have the potential to grow up as rapists and are angry she says without the right coaching men show up at courts looking angry and that feeds right into the bias mitchell always tried to keep dads out of court preferring to settle matters in counseling a strategy she said most firms focused on billable hours unfortunately avoid theres no doubt jones the man struggling to afford child support was in a better situation before stepping foot in a courtroom about a year and a half after his initial appearance he returned to court with a lawyer to argue for more visitation rights he was unsuccessful his exwifes lawyer argued that he was an unfit father because he whoops his kids butts with a belt to discipline them which he admits is true and is often on call for work but without regular access to his kids jones says his life has deteriorated his ex wouldnt let him talk to their kids on the phone and he stopped getting notified by their school about report cards and field trips jones began lashing out at colleagues and was written up so many times by management that he was fired his new gig pays less an hour and as a result hes more than behind on his child support payments and behind in rent now when jones sees his kids he cant even afford the to take them to their favorite place a bounce house with inflatable slides im home alone and have no money to go nowhere he says i cant even get my kids something i

ten years ago roughly nine months into our divorce my ex and i started to build a relationship the immediate aftermath of our split had been a sour blend of quiet and hurt we tried to make politeness our default position and it occasionally held what kept us connected was our boys then six and nine they cut through whatever anger sat between us we held to that one point of agreement change the boys lives as little as possible after children have seen their lives inverted that all sounds a bit feeble but it was a seed their mother retained primary custody the boys lived with her in the only house in new york they had known a loft in lower manhattan before moving back to my childhood neighborhood in brooklyn i spent two years in an apartment close to ground zero then a generally inactive construction site in it was just a way to live near the boys home and school the ghosts were quiet and my kids liked the hotel restaurant next to my building when a central home is maintained and parents cycle through it while the kids stay put its called birds nest custody or nesting we were improvising with the help of therapists and didnt know what nesting was even if we mimicked it we maintained two separate homes so our arrangement didnt qualify though we kept the boys concerns central our interactions with each other in the first year were the least generous but a second rule went into effect early no badmouthing the other parent whatever the topic and we were lucky we liked and respected each other beneath the turbulence thats where we had started so the irregular interactions led to a committed decision to not be ugly even when that seemed impossible there was enough doubt and hurt for all four of us anything to clean the air helped it was a way of being both selfish and considerate even when there wasnt much of it talking was a boon when living together decisions can be made by default without negotiation sightlines become assumed statements there she goes with the morning dropoff i guess shes ok with it but when you live in two places and children arent old enough to travel alone every movement has to be discussed who will take whom where and when can you take friday night because thursday i need to do something for work generosity encouraged reciprocity the marriage cynic would say well sure you had to get along because you cant engage in the silent warfare of marriages but of course you can fight if one parent doesnt care about seeing the kids that wasnt the case and a cold war never came we had no choice but to talk whatever else may vex me about cellphones beginning with my own dependence on them they allowed a reliable line to my kids in the past years weve rarely gone a day without talking or texting even when one of them had a sovietstyle flip phone that could only burp four words a minute not everything clicked smoothly into place talking involved just as many unpleasant standoffs as reasonable compromises youre letting them see what and do what and miss what school event but the distance between households in two different boroughs meant disagreements needed to end quickly we couldnt pretend the proximity of a shared house was some simulacrum of dealing with it if we didnt table a problem we wouldnt know how the other parent felt or what we were supposed to be doing empirically minute by minute parents make decisions that are as constant as the subjects are varied they can involve but are not limited to middle schools high schools unexpected silences from a normally chatty boy punishments for ambitious unauthorized parties whether or not hours is a comedy the choice of a party restaurant really far uptown way the hell away from brooklyn and other traditional life events i had no control over the most useful development two years into our divorce my ex reunited with her college boyfriend facebook is not entirely evil they became permanent partners both wearing engagement rings to this day marriage ruins everything they said so suspended in love they remain without any help from the state her partner became a third parent to my boys it is hard to accept that hes seen them more than i have in the past eight years it would be harder to accept someone into our family who wasnt willing to talk through whatever came up and continues to come up which is not to say the ache overwhelms the memories for every breakfast ive been absent from there is a trip to juniors restaurant just for cornbread and coleslaw for every broadway play missed theres a duet of two fools twisting to the

i am increasingly worried about my yearold son who isnt in regular work and who has started stealing from other family members he dropped out of education before completing his alevels and has since had a series of labouring jobs where the pay isnt good he has never been a great communicator but his life is a total mystery as he never brings friends home my husband and i both work and we have a nice home and a good standard of living my son has a free rein and we put very few demands on him he is able to help himself to whatever he wants from the fridge and has his own room it is like having a stranger in the house who comes and goes and while he can be perfectly pleasant he can also be verbally abusive to me and his sister if we upset him it doesnt take much such as asking him how his search for a job is going sentimental items of jewellery have gone missing in the past and when challenged he denied all knowledge a few weeks ago some money went missing from my daughters room i had cleaned her room that morning i have two very messy grownup kids and had seen it the following day i searched his room and found evidence that he had taken it when challenged he said he needed the money but would replace it although he didnt my husband is furious and is angry at me for not telling him at the time i had been trying to avoid a row by giving my son an opportunity to put the money back the pattern of our parenting has generally been that my husband cracks the whip and i think he is too harsh and so i collude with the kids to try to protect them my husband says he wont live with a thief in the house my son does have friends with whom he can stay but they are mostly nonworking dopesmokers just like my son i guess i am afraid that if we make him homeless his problems will just get worse my first thought was how disengaged you all seem from one another and the curious lack of detail as if you have all been bumbling along until now i contacted angela evans a child and adolescent psychotherapist childpsychotherapyorguk who has worked extensively with troubled teenagers one of the first things she picked up on was that you are cleaning the rooms of your grownup children she feels this is indicative of something else perhaps an inability to let go of your role of mothering this is not to apportion blame but it may help to identify your own colluding behaviour and therefore your son not being able to separate and become his own person adolescence is about separating from adults explains evans to an extent you should be experiencing your older teenage children like a stranger evans feels that your son probably already felt like a failure finding himself out of education with no aim or job she thinks you should stop asking him how the job hunt is going as this will just provoke more anxiety also it becomes about your agenda not his in evans extensive experience of working with teens she says lying and stealing is classic behaviour among difficult teenagers when they are angry and feel left out it replaces an emptiness clearly however some major communication channel has broken down between you all you mention drugs in passing and i wonder how much of a factor that is if he is on drugs his behaviour explains evans is not driven by the thinking part of the brain you may find talktofrankcom useful if we take the stealing as a form of communication what do you think your son is trying to say to you i was especially struck that he stole jewellery from you that had sentimental value this seems if he were thinking about it at all like a particularly aggressive act evans wonders what the relationship is like between him and his sister is she the good sibling its interesting that he seems to have stolen from you and his sister not his father what to do about it the key is for you and your husband to be a team says evans you need to talk and find a middle ground you are both happy with when you have talked evans suggests you then talk and listen to your son you need to draw up a contract to make family life run smoother his growing adulthood needs to be recognised but there also has to be no stealing you need to make time to check in with one another and respect one anothers spaces your daughter could be part of the contract and family discussions too as she will be part of the familys dynamic you all need to agree on certain standards of behaviour then you all sign it says evans if hes still hopeless if he doesnt want to sign it try to model the behaviour anyway if you are fair and decided you will be confident but it is key that you work out your parameters theres no point saying if you dont do this this will happen if you know you wont be able to do that i do feel you need to be more confident in your handling of your son finally says evans stop cleaning your childrens rooms let them take responsibility encourage them to be independent your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the guardian

women get paid less than men at every stage in their careers but the gender pay gap is widest during their s according to new analysis the pay gap begins as soon as women start working and is at its greatest when a woman turns with female employees cumulatively worse off than men over the next decade according to tuc analysis of figures from the office for national statistics the tuc analysis shows that the gender pay gap widens steadily from for yearolds to for women in their s and then falls slightly to for those in their s when women turn they earn less a year than men as caring responsibilities for children and older relatives take their toll on female earnings frances ogrady the tuc general secretary said women suffer a huge pay penalty over the course of their careers which peaks in their s at current rates of progress it will take decades for women to achieve pay parity with men having children has starkly different effects on mens and womens pay with women earning less after having kids and men earning more far more needs to be done to help mums get back into decent wellpaid jobs after they have kids and to encourage dads to take on their share of caring responsibilities an yearold woman working fulltime earns on average a year less than her male peers in a womans s she earns less a year than men of the same age and in her s it is on average when women enter their s the gap more than doubles to a year or over this decade this is largely due to parenthood tuc research published earlier this year found that at the age of the midpoint of a typical working life the pay gap between mums and dads in fulltime work was for childless men and women it was the mothers who were least likely to experience a motherhood pay penalty were those who had children later in life when they had reached more senior roles and returned to fulltime work soon after having children a government spokesperson said the gender pay gap is the lowest on record but we are committed to eliminating it completely thats why were taking action by requiring employers to publish their gender pay and bonus gaps for the first time ever from april next year we are modernising the workplace through shared parental leave doubling the amount of free childcare available to working parents and we are working with employers to make sure that women no matter their age have the support they need to stay in the workforce some progress has been made on closing the fulltime gender pay gap but it has slowed in the last few years the survey of hours and earnings from the office for national statistics showed the pay gap was falling by just percentage points a year if this continues it will take years to achieve pay parity between men and women the tuc recommended a number of measures including better paid paternity leave the union called on the government to go further and force employers to publish an action plan for shrinking the gender pay gap with sanctions

my daughter told me this week about a conversation she had with the barista at her local caf somehow the talk turned to the issue of women and their safety he surprised her by saying that we wont have achieved gender equality until his female friends can walk home late and feel as safe as he does this young man understands what so many dont most people accept that it is and maybe always will be unsafe for women to walk alone at night so it is therefore unwise for them to be out after dark no one suggests that all men stay home because some might attack women is it time to implement the concept that has so successfully helped to reduce drink driving we encourage groups of young people to nominate a designated driver why not a designated respecter a man who undertakes to ensure that none of his friends threatens or attacks others especially women when anyone in the group looks like theyre becoming aggressive or out of control the designated respecter is the sober voice of reason telling him to back off calm down walk away a simple come on mate she doesnt want to talk to you or youre not groping anyone on my watch were going home from a valued male voice could achieve what the same words in a female voice so often fails to respect for a womans wishes im only halfserious half tongueincheek but i have listened to survivors share their experiences of domestic violence for nearly years our concept of masculinity needs to move away from a proprietorial or covetous interest in women towards an acceptance that men have a responsibility not to harass women and that women have a right to their own space and their own choices about how much and with whom they socialise young women often share with me their online dating experiences a common issue is the difficulty men have respecting a womans hesitancy about sharing phone numbers or social media profiles before they have got to know them this may be because these men have no thoughts about abusing the privilege in any way but their response to refusal can be to take offense maintaining such boundaries is a safety measure used by women who know that they can be harassed or assaulted very easily keeping personal information private until women feel safe enough to share it is a general safety mechanism not a personal affront it is the consequence of the fact that intimate relationships are likely to be less safe for women than for men of course we live in a world where male persistence in the expectation that a woman will date you if you like her or agree to form a relationship if you wish it is portrayed as romantic this can lead to men thinking that if they persevere they will not only win the date of their dreams they will impress them with their fine romantic masculinity somewhere in this is the idea that the woman should be flattered and should say yes even more dangerous is the hidden assumption that the man is somehow entitled to continue with the relationship if he wants to that he somehow has the right to expect a positive response if only out of courtesy this is the fine line between an offer of romance and a proprietorial interest in a woman because she swiped left on a dating site or met you for a coffee or even spent a night with you women fought for the right to make these choices and the men who impress women are those who respect that refusal is a choice and that persistence is harassment unfortunately another side effect of the way dating is portrayed in media and film is that some young women can mistake controlling and possessive behaviour for love those who deliver violence prevention programs in schools tell me that this is common some students mistake the monitoring of their phones and the checking up on them when they are with friends as a sign of loving interest women i see who have lived with intimate partner violence sometimes recall this type of behaviour as a warning sign they failed to recognise human behaviour occurs on a continuum while a hurtful or threatening text message after the refusal of a second date may be mild in the harm it does it is the thin edge of the wedge of a sense of ownership of women the man who expects to find a woman to grope or worse as part of a big night out is just behaving at a further point along the same continuum this is why gender stereotyping and sexist remarks are related to violence against women and are part of our continued tolerance of the abuse of women young men who understand this connection and respect womens choices will not only increase their appeal to women they will make the world safer for all of us when women are safe to walk home at night rather than be expected to change their plans or their behaviour to stay safe from the few men who mean them harm then we will have made real progress in achieving gender equality a whole lot of things will need to change before this can happen this is what the young barista understands carmel obrien books is a psychologist and longtime domestic violence counsellor her first book blame changer understanding domestic violence is out now,2016-10,daughter told week conversation barista local caf somehow talk

barbara judge an americanbritish lawyer and businesswoman has argued that long maternity breaks are bad for women she said the us had a better approach companies with more than staff provide weeks of unpaid leave compared with britain where women can take up to a year off saying a bigger break from work left women at risk of losing their job we asked our readers how long mothers and fathers took off after the births of their children and why natalia grahamruiz from berkshire i felt judged and guilty when i went back to work after three months my partner left me while i was pregnant with my first child so i left london and my job to stay with my parents but this meant that after the birth i couldnt afford to take much maternity leave only three months as i needed to find a way of supporting myself and my son i am now married and with my second child my situation was very different and i was able to take months off i have regrets about having only three months off with my first child i missed out on so much for example my sons first steps the first time he rolled over on his own there were lots of firsts i missed because i was at work i also missed out on the friendships that new mums make when they take their children to baby and toddler activities i didnt do any of that because i went out to work i was a very lonely working single mum and when my son started school we didnt have any of those important networks or friendshipsi dont think there should be any hard and fast rules about maternity leave i dont judge anyone on the basis of the amount of time they take it is entirely up to them i felt judged and guilty when i went to work when my son was only three months old but i just did what was right for me at the time meerat kaur from london i rushed back to work as parenthood was affecting my mental health i was meant to take the full year off when my daughter was born however i rushed back to work after eight months because i found raising a baby incredibly difficult and it started affecting my mental health i went from doing a job that i was great at to spending looking after a baby and not really knowing what i was doing feeling constantly stressed by everything i felt a bit adrift and didnt know what to do when my baby wouldnt stop crying for example it was overwhelming and everyone was offering different advice on how to look after her i tend to always know what i am doing or can at least figure it out so i found my new role as mother difficult even with a good and happy baby albeit one that didnt sleep much i struggled i am not naturally good with babies which i didnt realise until i had one i felt at times like i was drowning on maternity leave rather than staying afloat i also found every day quite monotonous and there was no break even when youre ill you cannot really take a day off as a mum this all led to me feeling low and it was a feeling that wouldnt go away i was struggling and i missed my job ive always been used to having space to myself which i didnt realise was a coping mechanism for any stress i was facing suddenly i didnt have that and felt overwhelmed some mothers find looking after their children hard but its not always openly talked about as a mother society tends to expect me to stay at home with my child the system was designed for that to happen with me getting the statutory time off work however my husband would have been a much better carer for the baby than me he is just much better with young children patient caring and understanding he knows what to do when they wont stop crying and is ironically much more maternal than me i am now much better with our girl as she turns six we do lots of stuff together these days such as going kayaking and having discussions about the state of the world it would have been good to be able to sit down and talk about who looks after the children based on who has the skills and desire to do so this is more likely to happen due to the new rights introduced last year which allow parents to share weeks of leave between them of those weeks paid this means that with the birth of our next baby in january i can share parental leave more equally with my husband sam elfer from hove i was back at work barely a week into being a new father it wasnt long enough when my first child was born i took the statutory two weeks of leave but due to complications my wife and new son didnt come home for the first few days this meant that i was back at work barely a week into being a new father and it wasnt long enough to adapt i didnt know what to expect with a new baby but at the time it was a bit of a shock that this tiny creature needed almost hour care going into work after a week of no sleep and trying to concentrate on anything more than making a cup of tea was hard the second time round i booked a month off i also booked six weeks of fridays off im lucky to have an understanding employer the time i got to spend with my youngest was precious on fridays i could take the baby to the park and sit on the grass with him we would then collect my older son from school and take him for icecream it gave my wife a few hours out sometimes hed sleep and id read the paper and have a coffee a rare treat id definitely recommend it to new dads a month off was ideal after that i needed to get back to work but its different for everyone parents and employers need to be prepared to have a conversation about what works for both parties it doesnt need to be off or not a phased return more working from home and reduced hours can all help make the transition run smoothly anonymous from kent its not realistic to expect lots of time off two weeks is enough for the parent who is going back to work its necessary to be there but the immediate melee has largely subsided by then a month would be lovely but someone has to pay for it perhaps in some kind of utopia people would be allowed a sabbatical after each child is born but we can keep dreaming about that i couldnt really take full paternity leave im a magazine editor and the biggest issue of the year goes to press midmarch and both my eldest and youngest sons were born around this time of year obviously i knew the due date so i worked like crazy in the weeks and months leading up to the births but i still ended up being quite busy i had to proof pages and send emails chase images and copy regularly during the weeks after the birth it was a shame that i couldnt fully relax and enjoy the first couple of weeks of their lives but i was there at the births and changed their first nappies so i experienced the important things there wasnt really a day that i wasnt dealing with work but this isnt something im bitter about its just the way it was karen farrell from ireland my daughter was ill and that made me reassess my priorities i had nine months off initially i thought financially it would be better to work however by the time my child was three my wages were barely covering childcare i also wanted to be with my daughter so i left my job to be with her fulltime there is no question whatsoever that getting pregnant and taking time off was detrimental to my career however my daughter was quite ill for the first year and a half and this made me reassess my priorities i realised that work wasnt the most important thing in my life its not helpful for people to say mothers and fathers should rush back to work after having children some people dont want to work if it means sacrificing time with their children additionally all employers need to be more flexible as looking after a child can be challenging with strict working hours anonymous from peterborough no job could be more important than raising your own child i am about to enter my fourth year as a stayathome dad my wife is also lucky enough to work reduced hours since the birth shes only in four days a week we plan to keep this arrangement until our son goes to school a few months before his fifth birthday i believe children deserve to be raised by their parents whenever possible we were both cared for by parents until we went to school and we want to do the same for our son we want to give our boy the full attention of one adult as i believe this helps when it comes to earlyyears education and emotional stability because im the primary care person for him when hes upset he always calls for me what would be happening if someone outside of the family was the person he was bonding with theres a lack of stability and a lack of continuity plus i am loving every minute of looking after him even in the middle of the worst tantrum it still beats sitting in an office bored out my mind im spending every day with the person i love most in the world im seeing him grow and develop its astounding in an ideal world maternity and paternity leave would be equal and enforced with months or so allocated to each parent letting them take it whenever they want were all wired differently but i find it very hard to understand how any job is more fun and more important than raising your own child,2016-10,barbara judge americanbritish lawyer businesswoman ha argued

natasha walter ask yourself some questions about what you do i like to take an open view of this question if you believe in equality between men and women then as far as im concerned youre a feminist but whatever the reason that you felt you had to ask this question its likely that as soon as you did so you started to wonder what kind of feminist you are if you thought the labour party was split wait till youve cut yourself on some of the schisms in the womens movement in the s we got angry with one another about some hard questions is margaret thatcher a feminist are heterosexual women sleeping with the enemy is pornography always violence against women the questions havent got any less tough though they have shifted is theresa may a feminist is it biological sex or gender identity that defines women is prostitution always violence against women and nobodys ever quite decided whether men should be allowed in the room while were arguing but heres the thing to remember you dont need to get everyone in agreement to get on with the vital business of fighting for equality the suffrage movement split but they still got the vote so even when you are fiercely angry with your fellow feminists keep the real enemy the patriarchy in mind because its important to talk the talk but if you are a feminist you will also want to walk the walk ive found my own relationship with the womens movement so much more straightforward now that i work every day in an area with refugee women where we can focus on action rather than theory so if you want to know if you are a feminist try asking yourselves some questions about what you do in your work in your home in your everyday life do you support women rather than pull them down do you refuse to judge women including yourself on the absurd standards of hypersexual femininity do you speak out against violence against women do you support victims of male violence do you listen to women less privileged than you are and talk to women from different backgrounds and ethnicities about what they want from equality do you buy dolls for your son or encourage your daughter to be strong and fierce yes then youre a feminist we can chat about the other questions a bit later maybe over wine and definitely not on twitter lola okolosie sexist thinking forms the fabric of our daily lives would you like to quote black feminist bell hooks to end sexism sexist exploitation and oppression do you want to redress the imbalance of power that runs along gender lines are you up for wrestling gender equality from those who would rather evade the issue by pretending there isnt a problem if your answer is yes to all of the above you could easily be mistaken for a feminist and before the exasperated harrumphing that does not mean a feminist wants to wage an allout offensive on men that you hate men shtick is really only another way of getting us to focus our discussion on you guessed it men men and women can be guilty of sexist thinking and behaviour because it forms the fabric of our daily lives feminists have in fact been at the vanguard of examining what men lose as a result of living in a society that confers them so much power by virtue of their maleness it is a dominance that as constraining as it is intoxicating being a feminist is not believing your particular struggles as a woman are the struggles of all women all women do not experience life in the same way and anyway as black feminists have been saying since the dawn of feminism that kind of universalising talk only serves to marginalise anyone who differs from the white norm a feminist is committed to understanding and working with women whose struggles are impacted by a range of social categories from age to sexuality class to nationality race to ability feminists understand this is difficult work the payoff is the wonderful women we meet on the way kate maltby you dont have to be a lesbian or burn your bra youre looking for a quiz arent you thats what google thinks the question am i a feminist takes you to a smorgasbord of buzzfeed and huffpo quizzes but if anyone tells you they can calculate your feminist quotient with a quickfire round of questions on trans issues sexworker rights and abortion theyll probably leave you more confused wellintentioned selfdescribed feminists frequently disagree about all three for feminisms enemies the very diversity of feminist thought is a sign of weakness proof of intellectual inconsistency instead it should be celebrated as a strength try seeing feminism as a series of challenges to be solved do you think theres a link between biological sex and structural inequality then youre a feminist do you look at the world and ask why more young men are committing suicide or why more women than men become stayathome parents then youre a feminist feminism isnt an economic policy manifesto its a system of critique selfdeclared feminists have never agreed on all the answers to the worlds problems but they share an understanding of what those problems are so you dont have to be a lesbian or burn your bra you dont even have to be a socialist despite a long tradition of lefty men wholl tell you otherwise starting with charles fourier the frenchman who coined the term feminism in conversely some of us believe that modern capitalism has lifted more women out of poverty than its hurt although admittedly this doesnt make us popular one stereotype is true feminists are angry were not satisfied with the world as it is we dont believe that sexism is a thing of the past or that millennia of genderbased oppression have been erased in a century of slow progress so look around at the experiences of men women or anyone who rejects simple definitions of either if what you see

an americanbritish lawyer and businesswoman who took days off work when her son was born has said that long maternity breaks are bad for women barbara judge praised the way maternity leave was handled

its not often margaret thatcher is quoted in support of structural feminist arguments for fairness she wasnt actually talking about women when she said there is no liberty without economic liberty but when it comes to explaining gender inequality in australia the words at least are right two alarming reports that have surfaced in the past fortnight expose the economic bedrock on which the material disadvantage of australian women is perpetuated the first last week we learned that single women on average pay cant afford to live alone in sydney or in most melbourne suburbs the two most populous cities in australia the second that the industry that educates children in early childhood and which in australia just happens to be female employs workers on such low pay that they can not start a family travel or successfully apply for a mortgage these workers are not alone australian law has obliged employers to pay women and men equally for the same work since yet the disparities in what we pay industries dominated by female workers compared to those employing male ones exposes how deeply the gendered structural inequalities remain nareen young wrote in that womens work has never been seen as meritorious or valuable as mens its now and the traditionally femaledominated professions of care work community work healthcare human services education retail food services and accommodation work pay less than male dominated fields of construction engineering mining and finance some people insist that the pay disparity results from a somewhat incredible worldwide coincidence that statistically significant numbers of women pursue work with low pay gendered stereotypes excuse the poor pay of femaledominated industries on the fanciful basis that women dont seek work for money so much as for the happy positive feelings aroused by underpaid industrial servitude evidence alas demonstrates that devaluing stereotypes follow women into the workplace because once women enter an industry the pay drops equal rights to education and opportunity remain gestures towards equality and not outcomes while women continue to earn less and retire with less this confluence of circumstances denies women the means to live independently almost years after virginia woolf wrote a room of ones own and it encourages economic dependencies that can compromise gender equality in debilitating and dangerous ways the ongoing underpayment of early childhood educators illustrates two simultaneous disadvantages felt by australian women arguments against raising pay in this industry to the comparable standard enjoyed by men with similar qualifications such as construction workers or plasterers are made by the private childcare operators who complain of limitations on profit opportunities in an industry where wages account for twothirds of operating costs but this argument itself is proof of the structural inequity that overburdens australian women yes women with responsibility for integrating their working lives the hours they can work and the kind of jobs they can commit to doing around care obligations running childcare as profitmaking businesses restricts the service to those who can meet its costs denying the community universal gains of the better education for all children it also impacts womens productivity in nations with childcare thats affordable wellorganised and supported by the state such as france and the the scandinavian nations the female workforce participation rate is higher and incidentally so is the birth rate according to the grattan institute increasing the female workforce participation rate by a mere percentage points is enough to add bn of value to australias gdp there are few working australian women unfamiliar with the juggle struggle of managing their jobs with family responsibilities the term itself has been a feature of the national discourse for more than a decade but as we try to unpick the social threads that facilitate female vulnerability to family violence we have to recognise that these restrictions on womens economic liberty low pay lack of housing options and care obligations coalesce into situations that structurally diminish womens social status and oblige women into vulnerable living situations the university of wisconsin revealed in research from that women who are financially dependent on their partners are more likely to be abused by them that theyre less likely to leave these abusers and even the degree of womens economic dependence on an abuser is associated with the severity of the abuse they suffer economic abuse and enforced poverty is of course a form of controlling cruelty in itself its necessary for feminism to promote the ascendancy of women to equal positions of power and influence as enjoyed by men but electing margaret thatcher prime minister hardly ended gender inequality in britain the only meaningful redress is comprehensive structural change to create material parity this is what will allow women to enjoy the same independence as men and right now we dont have it single working women on average wages in sydney and most of melbourne

in this weeklong series anonymous writers share the most painful moment of their marriage the moment they knew their relationship was over the same sheriff is always there at the counter watching us you guys doin a custody dropoff he asks the first day as i sit breastfeeding my son in the reception area i nod and he leans over you guys cant work it out for the kid my exhusband shambles up late reeking of booze cigarette in one hand camera on record in the other also sporting a discreet video camera on his belt he takes our son straps him into the baby seat in the vehicle that used to be mine two hours later were back at the sheriffs station again this time so i can breastfeed our son three hours after that were back again so i can take him home this continues daily for five months after i found my husband smoking meth in our bathroom when i was heavily pregnant i gave him a second chance when he started to slip back to some dark and murky place when our son was barely two months old i still believed he wouldnt walk away from his family but the drinking midday out of coffee cups disappearing for hours at a time refusing to touch me savings leaking out of our broken account as he worked less and less the anger bubbling away underneath the surface i had to give him a final ultimatum i told him to do a drug test and get treatment and therapy or to leave he chose to leave i took it as impetuous bravado and thought hed be back even when my husband demanded a divorce and wanted me to sign custody papers i responded with the offer of a legal separation and a temporary agreement that he could visit his son under my roof every day because i did not see something irreparable in this breakdown i have a high threshold for pain an even higher tolerance for antisocial behavior and difficult people fascinate me perhaps because i am one myself what i didnt recognize for a long time after my husband walked out was that this was not about our marriage our relationship or our child this was about him throwing up every single distraction he could to distract from the fact that he was an addict we found ourselves in court before our son was months old he convinced the judge that i was a flight risk and i was unable to leave the country to visit my family and travel for work while we wound our way through the convoluted and inefficient court system for the next year the night before our son went in for major surgery i found out about the yearold my husband was sleeping with and discovered the hours and hours of obsessive audio tape dating back to when wed first met and realised that hed been religiously combing through my hard drive and my drawers my broken world collapsed a little more but this still wasnt enough to make me realize that our marriage had died and could not be resuscitated by this time no one wanted anything to do with the unholy mess that had consumed our lives entirely had wrecked my career and was draining us both financially and emotionally our son miraculously thrived despite the turmoil and the hate and the venom even when our court dates got pushed back and the attorneys demanded our custodydrop offs be conducted at a police station a common occurrence in disputed custody cases the reasoning being that the presence of the police was more likely to deter abusive behavior i still felt some hope as if we were in the type of hollywood movie where total destruction can be averted merely by force of will i could win this i could it was only when he snarled at me hatefully outside the sheriffs station one day and suddenly breaking the spell i leaned over placed my hands on either side of his face kissed his forehead and said why are you doing this to us that i found acceptance he started to cry and whispered i love you but its too late,2016-10,weeklong series anonymous writer share painful moment marriage moment knew relationship wa sheriff always counter watching u guy doin custody dropoff asks

my daughter who is now in her s is very angry with me about her childhood and has been for years she says she had a miserable time even though she seemed such a happy and sweet little girl in the s i was a single parent and brought her up in a bedsit she is very resentful about this she openly criticises me and tells me that i should have found a council house when we were staying in the bedsit she appeared happy the house we lived in was friendly and the setup was very familylike the landlady was extremely kind and my daughter would rush to her when she came home from school when my daughter was nine i met my husband to whom i have been married for more than years my daughter seems to love him as a father the financial hardship of her early years is in the past and nowadays none of us is hardup my daughter has a highpowered job i am pursuing my chosen career my husband is doing well at work and i would say that my husband and i are devoted to one another my daughter is not married and reminds me that people from broken homes are not good at establishing relationships she seems to have many friends though i was not married to my daughters father when i became pregnant he wanted me to have an abortion the last time i spoke to him my daughter was six weeks old and he told me to have her adopted there was no support for me because my mother died when my daughter was three months old and i was unable to go and live with my father at the time i was i dont know what to say to her any more because she just tells me off and shouts at me about her past how can i help her you can only help her up to a point the rest is up to her i think you have done remarkably well i wonder if in comparison with you your daughter feels she hasnt done so well with her life despite having it relatively easier practically at least my gp once told me something very wise you can blame your parents until you are but after that its up to you in other words once we are adults it is our own responsibility to sort ourselves out and stop blaming our upbringing i contacted dr shelagh wright a family psychotherapist at the association for family therapy aftorguk who says it sounds as if your daughter hasnt grown up and isnt taking responsibility for herself she wonders if your daughter is only seeing a small part of her upbringing and putting all the negative things in her life down to that do you think that maybe some of your daughters anger might be aimed at her father but as he is not there he has become a fantasy figure despite all the bad things he did whereas you are real and flawed what have you told her about her father asks wright we wondered how much she knew about her fathers desire to have her aborted or put up for adoption if she knows those things cant be easy for her to process and may have had an effect on her selfesteem she hasnt got the satisfaction of showing her father that she was worth having and keeping none of this is her fault or yours but you are there as the whipping boy wright feels that someone should stop the defensiveness you both seem to feel look inside yourself were there any things you could have done differently if so acknowledge them and say sorry i would counsel against constantly apologising for the same thing though as it will help nobody if your daughter keeps on at you about particular incidents a good thing to do is bat it back to her as in how would you have handled things differently what would you have done this is a powerful thing to say and can often stop a person in their tracks especially if they are used to berating someone for the same thing in longstanding family rows dialogue tends to fall into a groove try to alter what you say wright recommends something like youre my daughter and i love you what do you need me to do what do you need to do about this situation wright feels that your daughter needs the connection with you and says that arguing about the past has become your connection you also have to get rid of the guilt and stop thinking youve ruined her life for her part your daughter needs to temper her anger after all as wright points out your daughter has lived in a stable environment since the age of nine do you think she wants to trace her father is that possible i wasnt sure how much you knewremembered about him but she may find this link helpful lookthemorguksalvationarmyhtml ultimately if none of these suggestions move you forward wright suggests saying something like i want to have you in my life but i cant solve this problem for you i think that is something you need to do for yourself your daughter is in her s now and its time she took responsibility for her own life the triumphs and the failures your problems solved contact

female civil servants earnings have fallen further behind those of their male colleagues following a widening of the sectors gender pay gap that has bucked broader trends in the uk in the latest blow to hopes that theresa may can deliver on her promise to tackle inequality between the sexes official figures showed women being paid less than men on average at every level of the civil service the overall difference in median pay between men and women widened to in march from a year earlier the gender pay gap for fulltime employees increased to from but it narrowed for parttime employees to from the figures also showed women made up a bigger proportion of the civil service than men overall but they continued to be outnumbered by men at more senior grades the widening pay gap appears to be at odds with the trend for the economy as a whole which shows the uks gender pay gap slowly narrowing it edged down to for fulltime employees in the lowest since records began in however that gap is not directly comparable with the civil service figures because it covers an earlier period and is based on hourly pay without overtime the civil service pay gaps figures are based on annual salaries may has highlighted womens lower average earnings in her broader statements about tackling all forms of inequality which she cited as a key factor behind junes vote in britain for brexit her government has pledged to eliminate the gender pay gap within a generation and has introduced shared parental leave to help new mothers return to work as well as rules which from next april force bigger employers to publish pay gap figures but campaigners warn that at the current pace of improvement young women starting work today will have retired by the time the gap disappears a recent study by the consultants deloitte predicted that without radical action the gap would not be eradicated until or years after the equal pay act responding to the stated wider pay gap in the civil service a cabinet office spokeswoman said we are committed to tackling the gender pay gap in the civil service and improving female representation she said that as part of a wider plan the government was reviewing its approach to maternity leave and people returning to work in the civil service we have already introduced shared parental leave across the civil service and a new online job share portal to help people identify jobshare opportunities across the organisation frances ogrady the tucs general secretary said its worrying that pay for women in the civil service is falling behind mens especially for full timers and at senior levels we know there have been drastic cuts to the workforce in recent years and caps on publicsector pay the government should be monitoring the impact of these changes on women and considering what action is needed to reverse the widening pay gap the office for national statistics figures also showed that job cuts continued in the civil service in the latest financial year as george osborne when he was chancellor pushed on with his austerity drive civil service employment in march was down or from a year earlier the institute for government ifg

reverse this trend we already know that the government needs another civil servants to staff the two core brexit departments that might seem like a small number but its important to remember that this additional headcount is just for planning brexit we still have no idea how many trade negotiators and lawyers as well as ordinary civil servants we will need to deliver brexit and deal with its consequences the ons figures also showed that of those who declared their ethnicity were from an ethnic minority up slightly on of those who declared their disability status were disabled also a small increase on it is encouraging that the proportion of bame black asian and minority ethnic staff and staff with a disability who work in the civil service is at the highest ever level across all grades

some years ago at the beginning of my political career i campaigned for an end to female genital mutilation and for tougher penalties for those responsible for carrying it out little did i ever imagine that i would be in the position as home secretary where it would be my job to drive on the governments efforts to get rid of this brutal practice it is one of my absolute priorities working with the police and other agencies to see this government is the one under which there is the first successful prosecution and punishment of a perpetrator of this horrible crime and lets be clear about that it is a crime the law in this country is not there to be compromised or to be blinkered fgm honourbased violence and forced marriage are illegal they are pernicious forms of abuse of women and we will not shy away from tackling them because of cultural sensitivities we have made progress we have introduced measures to protect women and girls we now have laws such as a new offence of domestic abuse that covers controlling and coercive behaviour prosecutions have begun for stalking offences forced marriage is criminalised and the revenge pornography law that came into effect last year should start to bring an end to the humiliation and pain caused when expartners share intimate images online these are some but by no means all of the powerful means we have at our disposal to tackle violence against women and girls from crown prosecution service figures last month it is clear the volume of prosecutions and convictions is at its highest ever level meaning more victims are seeing justice than ever before but the reality is that you cant legislate your way out of everything much of the challenge is about stopping vulnerable people becoming victims in the first place giving people the voice they need to seek help and supporting them as the scars both the ones you can see and the ones you cant begin to heal we also have to be honest with ourselves and confront some brutal truths about the society we live in and we have to be prepared to have some difficult conversations about some distressing subjects there are still far far too many women and men who are the victims of domestic abuse who are beaten who live in fear in their own homes who are stripped of their sense of self isolated from friends and family by coercive partners it is a terrifying and disturbing pattern with which those who have been listening to helen titcheners harrowing storyline in the archers will be familiar the toxic wake of scandals such as savile and rotherham and the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse has exploded into the public consciousness an awareness of child exploitation and abuse the like of that simply did not exist before the only way to ever neutralise that toxicity and give victims and survivors the justice they deserve is to be utterly unsparing about the failings that led us here and what lessons must be learned transparency and public discourse are crucial we cant treat issues as taboo because we find them unpleasant we must lift the shroud of silence and light up the dark corners that allow the perpetrators to operate that public discourse must also make clear which behaviours are acceptable and which are not it matters what those in the public eye say this is something i would urge the shadow chancellor to reflect upon long and hard remarks about lynching or assassinating female politicians any politicians are not jokes and they are not funny whoever they are made about the reality is that there is still too much that goes on behind closed doors and we still have much much more to do to reveal the true scale of hidden vulnerability protecting children at risk of exploitation will always be a priority and at the other end safeguarding an ageing population brings its own challenges the nature of drug and alcohol dependency is continually evolving what remains constant is the need to stop those individuals with some of the most challenging and complex needs slipping through the cracks we have begun to address the canker of modern slavery where victims are forced into degrading sex work or backbreaking domestic servitude and we will continue to lead the global fight to eradicate it working with our partners abroad with an estimated million people worldwide enslaved this will not be an easy fight but it is not one we will lose the heart for no one believes this more than the prime minister she stood in downing street a few months ago and promised a britain that works for everyone she wanted the country to know that this government would tackle the injustices of poverty race and class she wanted you to know it is our priority to deliver a fairer and a safer society for all of its citizens our conference which starts today is an opportunity for me and my cabinet colleagues to set out how we will do that for my part let me be clear protecting those in society most at risk of harm those crushed at the bottom of the heap those who have been abused by the very people who should have looked after them is as home secretary my job but i also see it is as my moral duty comments will be

thousands of families with disabled children have lost out on up to a year in tax credits after an administrative blunder by the authorities the error in processing their claims meant an estimated families whose children qualified for disability living allowance dla during missed out on an additional tax credit premium of between and a week the government revealed in the autumn statement this week that it had set aside m over six years to ensure these families receive child disability tax credits in future however the payments will be backdated only to april meaning individual families may have lost out on entitlements totalling up to over the past five years the nonpayment of the tax credit premiums appears to have been a result of the department for work and pensions dwp failing to inform hmrc about families eligibility for the award over a threeyear period the charity contact a family called for a compensation fund to be set up to help the families saying it was not their fault that they lost out on what collectively amounted to tens of millions of pounds in entitlements one thing is certain this isnt the fault of families when you tick a box on a government form indicating you are in receipt of tax credits you reasonably expect its there for a reason and theres a process in place that allows government departments to share this information said the charitys head of

benefit such as disability living allowance dla or personal independence payment pip although it is technically the responsibility of the claimant to inform hmrc directly that they receive dla or pip for their child in practice the tax authorities have endeavoured to update the claim automatically using information supplied by the dwp when a family applies to the dwp for a disability benefit on behalf of their child the form asks whether they are in receipt of tax credits if they state that they are and the application is approved the dwp would normally pass the information directly to hmrc hmrc regards the datashare as an extra safeguard to ensure that the extra child disability amounts are paid even when claimants have not directly notified them they were in receipt of the benefit however between a processing error described officially as a gap in the data feed between dwp and hmrc meant awards were not automatically updated despite the large sums of money involved the tax credits correction was referred to without explanation in the main treasury autumn statement report with only sketchy details of the error buried in a supporting document on policy costings robin williamson technical director of the pressure group low incomes tax reform group said the amounts payable for disabled and severely disabled children within child tax credit are significant and it is concerning that such a large number of people have missed out on claiming these payments potentially for a number of years it is important that hmrc work closely with dwp to ensure that the data feed works in future so this situation does not happen again although the claimant has a legal obligation to report changes to their circumstances we often encounter claimants who quite reasonably assume that this kind of information is shared within and between government departments this is certainly happening more frequently and means there is a confusing landscape for claimants and a mismatch between the legal framework and the operational practice he said summerson said we are pleased with the announcement that for these families their awards will be amended and the extra amount paid from april this is something weve been campaigning on the error occurred during a period of intense upheaval at the dwp when the then work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith was pushing through over separate reforms including universal credit while at the same time cutting the departments administrative budget by and reducing staffing by nearly a quarter a national audit office report published

the victorian premier has unveiled a year plan that will ensure successive governments deliver all recommendations of australias first royal commission into family violence along with new funding and education campaigns daniel andrews announcement on thursday morning brought the former australian of the year and family violence survivor rosie batty and many other survivors and advocates in the room to tears the plan was among the royal commissions recommendations handed down in march and was needed the commission said to detail exactly how the government would implement the enormous number of recommendations and hold itself to account the commission gave the sector a voice and it gave governments nowhere to hide andrews told a room full of family violence survivors advocates and frontline workers on thursday morning it has brought into the open something that for too long hasnt been given the attention the priority and the leadership it absolutely deserves he said the commissions work had uncovered countless failures including shamefully how governments for a very long time had not listened and not acted the plan was a key measure to ensure the state government and successive governments would be forced to act and implement reform andrews said some reforms had already been initiated immediately after the completion of the royal commissions work this plan provides a pathway for implementing every other recommendation made by the royal commission andrews said it extends right across the government and right across the state a plan for this term of government and the one after that and the one after that so no matter who the government is we are accountable to deliver on all of these reforms if we are to be the state the community that we all aspire to be a fair and strong and decent place a national leader then we need to get this right and we need to do more and that is exactly what i intend to do andrews announced a further m in social housing and private rental assistance to keep women and children who are fleeing family violence safe bringing investment in that sector to m since the royal commission handed down its findings next year reforms will be introduced to parliament to strengthen intervention orders tighten up the bail process and allow better information sharing between police and other agencies to ensure perpetrators privacy is not protected ahead of keeping women and children safe new bodies will be created to ensure the measures were implemented including a coordination agency to oversee the creation and support of safety hubs being established across the state onestop shops where victims will be able to access a range of services to keep them safe a prevention agency will also be established with dedicated funding focusing on providing the best advice the announcements on thursday followed the victorian governments m investment in family violence detailed in the budget a further year investment plan focusing on funding will be released in march andrews announced a television advertising campaign focused on changing mens behaviour that would run for years he then said every recommendation from the coronial inquest into the death of yearold luke batty who was killed by his father on a cricket field in tyabb victoria in would be implemented the plan does not have labor government branding on it and is intended as a measure to be used by successive governments no matter which party is in power batty the chairwoman of victorias victim survivors advisory council was overwhelmed by the announcement i hope i can speak she told the room as victims of family violence we have been betrayed of our power and our safety we know what its like to be ignored we know what its like to experience a systems shortcoming we know what its like to be blamed for the acts of violence committed against us we know what its like and how it feels when our loved ones are killed our wisdom comes from our lived experience the advisory group had been essential to helping the government determine how to best implement the recommendations she said importantly the measures being implemented by the government would protect survivors and give them a strong voice she said silencing victims protects the perpetrator she said through tears it condones their behaviour it robs victims and survivors of their dignity to women who may be living in fear know that you are courageous you are strong and to all victorians we need to speak out against this responding to the plan the chief executive of domestic violence victoria fiona mccormack admitted that she was among those initially skeptical sceptical of the need for a royal commission we already know what we need she said i thought couldnt that money be better invested and what do you know the royal commission comes out with a cracker of a report and then we have the victorian government saying we will implement every one of those recommendations and that commitment is reiterated in this plan and then we have funding we have always struggled so hard for that in the context of rising demand and women and children being murdered she urged bipartisan support for the plan its an issue neglected for a long time its complex if this was compromised by a change of government it would be a tragic waste through tears she urged the federal government to support recommendations from the commission only it could support such as new medicare items for family violence survivors the national sexual assault domestic family violence counselling service can be reached at the mens referral service provides anonymous and confidential telephone counselling information and referrals to men to help them take action to stop using violent and controlling behaviour women who need help can call respect on or visit respectorgau,2016-11,victorian premier ha unveiled year plan ensure successive government deliver

it was white ribbon day and federal parliamentarians lined up in support of ending domestic violence with worthy setpiece offerings but only one contribution was powerful enough to shame the chamber

heart would linger much longer mum then bundled my sister and i into the family car and fled sheltering in pubs the people below were loud and sometimes their noise would spill into the streets waking me and reminding me that i wasnt in my own bed in my own home i was in a foreign place because i was not safe then the end of the violence one last terrible incident there were police cars the last

women of colour for women of colour because generic services did not meet their needs those needs remain unmet and women of colour and migrant survivors remain more likely to be trapped in violence

and support you need she said in womens aid reported that refuges were being forced to turn away two in three survivors who approached them for a range of reasons including a lack of space to an

recently i visited my brother and his wife and was left asking myself some questions why did he never like me what did i do wrong why is he talking behind my back with relatives at other family events does his wife believe what he says why cant he accept me like he accepts our little brother whom he loves unconditionally i dont think i did anything wrong as a child or anything to justify this in my teenage or adult years everything i have ever done has been a joke and ridiculous to him all my life choices were jokes to him at family gatherings its always the same story my brother refuses to talk to me or even to say hello it always ends with a proof of how great he is and him belittling me and it is never done as a joke i feel so humiliated why does he have to put me down in front of others why cant he just like me his wife makes a great effort to chat with me and my mum and i make a great effort to try to bond with his wife she is my only connection to my brother the nice side of him my mum only wants us to be friends it is her deepest sadness that we cannot get along these moments are leaving me in a mess i have reached out a hand to him since i was a child and i always wanted to have the same sort of relationship as he has with our younger brother i get no result do i need to go to these family events just to comfort my mother its a long day of tension that does not end after i go home it leaves me full of questions that i believe i will never have an answer to no you dont have to go to these family events just to comfort your mother but it sounds as if you would like a different relationship with your brother i consulted susanna abse psychoanalytical psychotherapist bpcorguk to understand sibling rivalry she explains one has to understand it in the context of the whole family abse says that sibling rivalry has been with us all of human history and all who have siblings have an inkling of what its like you can even have sibling rivalry in the closest of sibling relationships but she continues it often arises in the context of early deprivation if there is lots of love and care to go around things like this the situation between you and your brother dont get going quite as strongly abse wondered where your dad was there was no mention of him in your longer letter the other parent can be greatly beneficial in helping to manage sibling relationships especially when the children are young both abse and i wondered where you came in the family and we wondered if perhaps you were close in age and your brother was older than you to help you with this because you clearly want them to be different we thought it may be useful to turn the situation around and instead of looking at how awful your brother is being it may be beneficial to look at things from his point of view maybe thinking about your early lives what were your parents like with you both what were they like with each other in front of you and thinking what life was like for you as small children specifically what life was like for him after you came along if you are younger its possible speculates abse that your brother is projecting on to you a lot of infantile feelings which youre having to carry for him maybe he had to grow up too quickly when you were born if he was born first he humiliates you and implies you are silly maybe this is because he had to suppress his own childlike neediness indeed in your longer letter it sounds as if the way your brother behaves towards you is very childlike humiliating you putting you down the way that child siblings are together so your brother may be acting in this very way because hes stuck in his childhood relationship with you your brother has feelings he cant show or couldnt show explains abse so he has converted those feelings into something else what can you do abse suggests trying to start a dialogue with him away from your mother and others i said a few months ago that sibling relationships can be transformed away from the parents could you email your brother and say something like id like us to be friends and at some point ask him what his formative years were like honestly if youve never done this with a sibling it is really illuminating this may not work of course you are reflecting on the relationship explained abse he may not be if he does not accept i would pull back for a while find what makes you you what gives you confidence outside of family life and put your energies into friends be polite to him and his wife sounds like she may be your greatest ally here that way when you do see him you will be more resilient you can try again but remember you can only control your of the relationship with him the rest has to be up to him your problems solved contact annalisa barbieri the

this week the eyes of the world were on the us where its firstever female presidential nominee vied to become its firstever female president but it was not to be despite leading the popular vote hillary clinton was unable to secure the number of electoral college votes required to win and so in her words she had not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but its not just the worlds most powerful office that remains out of womens reach the gender pay gap still exists and women in iceland recently downed tools at the moment in the working day after which women effectively work for free icelandic women shortened their day by to represent the fact that women there on average earn less than men in the uk and in france equal pay day marks the same effect on an annual scale here it falls today november meaning that in on average women effectively stopped earning days before the end of the year relative to men this actually marks an improvement applying the same methodology as the fawcett society does in calculating equal pay day shows that years ago that gap was days meaning the date would have fallen almost a month earlier on october the improvement has not been consistent it fell back in and between and mens average hourly pay grew at almost twice the rate of that of women shifting equal pay day back by three days but despite an overall positive trend the fawcett society estimates that it will take another years at the current rate of progress for the uk to reach pay parity methodology equal pay day is calculated by applying the mean gender pay gap to the calendar year provisional figures for indicate that the gap between men and womens fulltime average wages in the uk is as a proportion of the calendar year days as this is a leap year days nb the

its that time of year again thursday november marks equal pay day the date from which as a result of the gender pay gap women in the uk are effectively working for free for the rest of the year according to the fawcett society the fulltime pay gap stands at and at the current rate of progress it will take years to close and the figures are even starker for bame women who face a pay gap compared with white workers but women across europe have had enough and have started staging walkouts to protest against this pay disparity in october thousands of women in iceland left work at pm on a monday afternoon the time from which they are essentially working for free every eighthour day and this week women in french workplaces including paris city hall downed tools at precisely pm highlighting the moment at which their annual days of unpaid labour began such protests draw attention to the gender pay gap a phenomenon that has become so normalised that women are encouraged to simply accept it when were not being repeatedly told that it doesnt exist at all why should we continue to accept being constantly shortchanged so inspired by the women of iceland and france i have a few ideas about how women in the uk could highlight the deficit they face and see how readily others are prepared simply to shrug and get on with it from november onwards when doing the office tea round ensure your male colleagues mugs are just full let their tea water cool degrees after the kettle reaches boiling point and just to drive the point home take a small but pointed bite out of their biscuit when dropping children off at school a task that is part of the unpaid caring work still disproportionately done by women drive only of the way then stop abruptly bundle them out and let them walk the remaining of the journey similarly clean only of any room scrape of the food off any plate you have prepared for male family members and take care to wash only of any sock belonging to a male partner simply cutting the toes off before washing would be an efficient way to achieve this women in different careers feel free to be creative and make the point in your own unique and personal ways surgeons down your scalpels with of the operation left to go waitresses cut a wedge out of each customers pizza actresses walk off stage of the way through a play leaving the audience to guess the ending i advise female refuse collectors to leave of the contents of each residents bin in a neat pile on their doorstep if engaging in any kind of sexual activity with a male partner between now and new years day wait until you estimate that they are precisely of the way towards climaxing before stopping abruptly and abandoning said sexual activity for a good book or a jessica jones boxset for ease of calculation recent statistics suggest this will take an average time of min sec these are of course tongueincheek suggestions but it is frustrating to wonder how long it will take before this

so i confess im one of those no good double dipping mums taking advantage of the taxpayer so i can stay home for a few more weeks to spend my days hanging out and drinking coffee with my other double dipping mummy friends sure i also intend to use the time to recover from giving birth and take care of a newborn including giving him or her access to my body to eat every few hours or so but that wont be too hard im prepared to rort the taxpayers of australia to do this im currently weeks pregnant with my second child due the first week of april next year and along with thousands of other expectant mums and those hoping to be i am anxiously waiting to see where nick xenophon and team will land on the future of our paid parental leave system whilst senator hinch also now appears open to reconsidering his support for the governments cuts to ppl itll still be nick xenophon who could be make or break and though it may seem strange its the xenophon teams plans to negotiate a fairer and more equitable ppl system that has many mums seriously worried turnbull and morrison want to take time away from women arguing its unfair to afford women access to government and employer leave but whats worse is xenophons argument that its unfair that a womans partners income isnt taken into account when determining eligibility for the governments scheme a move to base ppl eligibility via a means test on household income would be a fundamental shift in policy that would completely undermine the social and economic purpose of paid parental leave the productivity commission the architects of our current system rightly recognised both business and government had a responsibility to respond to a parents need to take a period of time away from work to care for a newborn and by working to get the policy settings right not only would we see more newborns and their new parents achieving better health outcomes we could also help to protect pregnant women from being disadvantaged by the fact that they must take some time out of work to have their baby although we want to encourage men to take more time in those first few months the basic biological fact is that men dont have to recover from birth nor do their bodies produce what may make up a babys sole diet for those first four to six months of life breast milk and so it makes complete sense that access to a paid parental leave system that both employer and government contribute to be based on the income of the individual likely to be mum taking the leave but if the eligibility for the governments system moves from what the individual taking the leave earns to what the joint income is for a household it ceases to be a work payment and instead becomes a social welfare payment and so it would effectively mean a womans access to paid parental leave would be dependent on her husbands income or that ppl would turn into a new big baby bonus paid to the family rather than a recognition that a parent that is the mum is taking leave from work to be with their newborn in those first precious months taking household income into account might appear fair but it gives no reference to the fact that there is a parent taking leave from work or that theres a desire to keep that parent connected to their workplace assisting and promoting an eventual return to work and herein lies the problem and its far from fair there are a few really embarrassing statistics when it comes to gender equality in australia weve recently slipped to th in the world on economic gender equality we were ranked th in and our current gender pay gap sits at the workforce participation rate of australian mums is for mums with young children compared to of fathers further women in paid work are more often than not in parttime casual or insecure work compared with of fathers who are in full time employment in working mothers report having been discriminated against or have experienced discrimination in the workplace as a result of falling pregnant or because they have children more than of younger working mums age group feel they have been overlooked for promotions at work because they have children the reality is australia has a significant gender equality problem which is often most pronounced during the years women are having babies and raising children and this is why xenophon and his team or any politician who suggests joint income means testing pose a more significant threat to paid parental leave then turnbull and co it beggars belief that we wed move to a system that would mean a womans access to paid parental leave leave she physically must take for a least some period of time be tied to her husbands income such a move would set australia even further behind when it comes to ensuring women get an even playing field in the workplace its not our choice believe me that were the only ones technically equipped to have babies so to tie paid parental leave eligibility to a mans wage would fundamentally destroy the system as we know it and we cant go backwards because were already too far behind message to xenophon and team and hinch too if youre listening in the event you are about to

here we go again the equal pay act was introduced years ago and yet from thursday this week the uks female workforce will effectively be working for free until december due to the scale of the gender pay gap this years equal pay day which highlights the difference between mens and womens salaries is only one day later than it was last year this reflects the glacial pace of change in reducing the gulf between the genders in earnings average pay for fulltime female employees is still lower than for fulltime male employees according to the latest official figures that gap is only slightly better than the recorded in but at least an improvement on back in women continue to be penalised with lower pay and fewer promotions when they return to work after taking time away to care for children and because they tend to work in jobs with lower salaries such as caring and administration there is also a penalty for working parttime where pay on average is less per hour than in fulltime work and a far higher proportion of women work parttime compared with only of men whats more when compared with other countries records on gender equality the uk has slipped down the global rankings it was the ninth most genderequal country in but by this year had slipped to th place according to tables compiled by the world economic forum at this pace it will take decades to close the gender pay gap on one estimate equal pay will finally be achieved years after the equal pay act was enacted thats bad news for a government that has vowed to close the gap within a generation to be fair ministers have made some encouraging noises and even some meaningful changes they include flexible parental leave and the national living wage of which twothirds of recipients are women the government is also increasing the amount of free childcare on offer to working parents and in a bid to put pressure on employers from april next year all those with more than staff will have to publish their gender pay gap there are also moves to get more women on boards even so rather than celebrating the latest marginal improvement in the pay gap as ministers did when the figures came out it is time to come up with more radical moves to stamp out workplace discrimination support womens careers and get more young women into higherpaying sectors at the moment girls and boys are let down by inadequate careers advice and when they get into the workplace they are let down again by a chronic underinvestment in training that traps far too many people in lowpaying lowskilled jobs in placing employers under more scrutiny the new rules in april should be helpful but it is not enough to name and shame the worst offenders workers need more means to challenge those inequalities companies must be made to explain themselves the government could start by scrapping the tribunal fees that stand in the way of many women getting justice from employers who have discriminated against them in most cases the pay gaps that come to light under the new disclosure rules next year will be down to the usual factors of more men than women being in the top jobs as opposed to outright discrimination and men earning more than women for the same work but if we accept those differences in seniority we might as well give up on hopes of closing the pay gap instead offending firms should be made to reassess how they train and promote people how they hire new staff and what kind of flexibility they offer theresa may called for gender equality when she set out her pledge for a britain that works for everyone if she meant it she must get tough on britains stubbornly wide pay gap green hardly the one to rule on bhs pension five months ago this newspaper wrote that the bhs scandal was not about the failure of capitalism but the failure of people to recognise their basic moral duties last week as the pensions regulator started formal legal proceedings against sir philip green and dominic chappell the former owners of bhs that statement is as pertinent as ever there has been much debate about how much green has offered the regulator to support the bhs pension scheme which has a deficit of m but really this does not matter the pensions regulator is the organisation best placed to rule on how to financially support an ailing pension scheme the key is in the name yet green cannot bring himself to meet the watchdogs demands and is proposing a complex deal that would involve the bhs pensions becoming part of a new pension scheme that is not secured by a sponsoring company the billionaire promised to sort the problems facing the bhs pension scheme but we are still waiting for a settlement it is now clear green wants to sort it on his terms but as the size of the bhs deficit shows he is not the ideal person to be dictating the terms of a pension rescue the pensions regulator and its boss lesley titcomb are fighting for their future after the criticism they have received because of the bhs scandal this and the febrile political atmosphere around green add an extra dimension to their work but at least their remit is focused on getting the best deal for bhs pensioners who will ultimately have to pick up the bill if it enters the pension protection fund funded by a levy on other schemes that is why the regulator is right to press ahead with formal action against green even if it could take years to resolve in the meantime hopefully green will face up to his responsibilities to the bhs workers who lost their jobs and agree to the regulators demands it should not be forgotten that while they have lost their jobs and some retirement benefits green has only lost his reputation mamps faces bitter conflict on store closures get ready for a brutal battle between marks amp spencer mps and trade unions the high street retailer clashed with politicians and union leaders when it tried to make changes to pay and pensions but wait and see what happens when it announces next week that is closing dozens of shops and downsizing its clothing offer in others mamps may no longer produce the lucrative profits it did in its heyday in the late s but its shops are still the bastion of high streets across the country each of its shops can employ more than people and they offer towns a reliable collection of highquality food and clothing so when mamps proposes shutting a shop it is a big deal the company tried to close nine last year affecting workers sparking petitions and rows in places including aldershot in hampshire steve rowe the mamps chief executive is right to take action the company

during my maternity leave i had a conversation with a guy at a party where he regretfully told me that as long as men couldnt give birth equality would never be a reality perhaps women just arent meant to work he concluded maybe not i replied brightly later deciding not to tell him he was trailing toilet paper from his shoe i felt really lucky a couple of months later to return to a job that i care about where they agreed to let me work from home one day a week especially as i saw so many friends of friends made redundant weeks after having their babies or encouraged to leave just before in a flurry of meetings in which they were chastised for not having replied to emails with the correct greeting or for taking the full hour for lunch even the wealthy arent immune keira knightley upon returning to work this week after having a baby talked about britains archaic maternity laws you need to be a family unit not just have the guy there for two weeks and then go back to work and the mother is left desperately trying to figure it out she said of paternity leave the new rules on which will only have an effect if businesses actively encourage fathers to take the time off and if colleagues dont quietly roll their eyes more than threequarters of pregnant women and new mothers the equivalent of of us experience what they call negative and potentially discriminatory treatment and what my friends call fuckery at work each year a new report from the equality and human rights commission confirms the stories i heard in those long mornings pushing buggies round parks with nct survivors that of women are pushed out of their jobs following maternity leave around a year and because of this british businesses are losing m in hiring training payouts and lost productivity every year all to avoid a bit of change and as if the arrogance and unfairness of this wasnt enough then then you realise one of the sideeffects of all these pregnant redundancies was the invention of the mumpreneur i cant help but imagine the newly unemployed mothers as a wounded army stranded after the war ends looking out at the sea with a mixture of hope and fear inevitably some will deal with this by launching a linen babysling company perhaps a business selling personalised suede nappy bags or organic cot bedding or mittens i know im being a patronising dick but do put that aside for a second stick it over by the waterwipes and ask whether these women would have launched their unnecessary businesses if they werent themselves feeling superfluous if they hadnt had their careers cut off at the elbow as soon as they felt their first child kick if the companies they worked for had taken the time to reshape around their female staff and adapt to new schedules rather than just shrugging cant i feel similarly about the weight of mummy blogs that threatens to sink the internet for every mumsnet there are a thousand mumsnots either reports on how many times its author has cried that day the comments a circlejerk of struggle or else a filtered reverie of a perfect life necessary to wangle free yogurt as time goes on im starting to find one as fantastical as the other even in the honesty blogs its not possible to be truly honest because to do that would surely mean saying i want real people to talk to this is not enough again im being dickish but between the lines you so often see a woman who wants to be recognised who wants to be around people and produce something that people need who has found themselves blunted without a point it is possible to run a small business and have children it should also be possible to run a big business and have children and to be an employee and to invent something unrelated to your childs bathtime starting a business is isolating its lowpaid its difficult to plan a future its often a last resort the modern view of a selfemployed mum officing at her kitchen table says more about crippling childcare costs and inhospitable workplace cultures than it does a utopian future where we can have it all maternity discrimination birthed the mumpreneur if that doesnt get you angry enough to encourage change nothing will email eva at

lowincome parents will feel the financial squeeze at every stage of childhood if the government pushes through cuts to family payments and paid parental leave what was once an effective family payments system redesigned by the hawke government to achieve a reduction in child poverty has been cut to the bone in recent years since alone more than bn has been ripped out of the family payments system both sides of politics are responsible with measures such as removing the link between family payments and wages an effective cut of more than a week freezing eligibility thresholds tightening income tests and abolishing bonus payments on latest figures there are children living below the poverty line including more than of children in single parent families now the coalition wants to cut payments to these families more in an attempt to generate a budget surplus the governments latest attempt to do so is currently before the senate if they succeed in passing the bill single parent families with teenage kids will be the worst affected by per week for those with two teens families with very young children will not be spared either those thinking about starting a family cheered when the paid parental leave scheme was first announced in finally australia took a tentative first step towards a proper paid parental leave scheme an essential component of the scheme developed by the productivity commission was that it be in addition to existing employerfunded schemes offering a guaranteed minimum of weeks leave at the minimum wage was an important first step towards meeting the world health organisations recommended weeks of paid parental leave to support breastfeeding and bonding between mothers and babies the scheme is not generous by global standards our government paid parental leave scheme runs second to last among oecd nations lagging well behind the uk and canada any suggestion that new parents are doubledipping is just an attempt to give cover to what this is really about budget savings the proposed changes would reverse australias baby steps towards a universal paid parental leave scheme and entrench our reputation as an international laggard on gender equity while the child care package will benefit many families in paid work young children whose parents who are not employed will have their access to early education halved in the name of costcutting it seems our pursuit of gender equality and child wellbeing have virtually disappeared as national government priorities if the changes to family benefits and paid parental leave pass in their current form they will cut the incomes of the families who can least afford it at every stage of a childs development from postnatal support for mother and child through to teenagers on the verge of adulthood if we are serious about ensuring a balanced budget across generations and placing love and care at the heart of what our nation should be about surely we should instead be addressing the core drivers of growing inequality including the generous treatment of property based tax concessions and retirement incomes the governments super reforms were always modest affecting just the very wealthy and are now even more so a courageous government would also accept the overwhelming expertise that urges reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax they should be working

bibi lynch its exhausting and crushing family october nails the emotional cruelties casually handed out to nonmothers to adapt her preferred term of nonparents nonfathers are on the receiving end of similar treatment at its worst while dads are happily left in charge of other parents children we nonfathers are not so trusted it was recently suggested to me that paedophiles are mostly men without kids like nonmothers nonfathers are routinely assumed to be emotionally compromised and biologically lacking many parents take the view that everyone wants kids and so men who dont have them are probably firing blanks some of us thought shared ideas of masculinity no longer rested on sperm count but maybe were too optimistic lynch makes the point that being a mum doesnt naturally mean anything neither does being a dad in common with many nonfathers i think with good grounds that i have a great deal to offer kids ive just never wanted to father them there are enlightened parents of course theyre the ones who realise that you dont need to reproduce to make your mark steve chinn stirling i am so appreciative of bibi lynch she says out loud what i am feeling constantly without being able to articulate it clearly enough to myself or others feeling left out sidelined ignored and meaningless is a constant drain that can suck all vitality out of me at times society and people in general seem so unaware and sometimes downright insensitive towards those of us who are involuntarily childless i gave a presentation on this at a counselling conference a while ago which was well received but as with all minority issues it was up to someone like me the minority person to highlight the difficulties distress and pain of being involuntarily childless at plus we are much more likely to be severely depressed or alcoholic than the general population not being a grandparent is a double whammy this can be somewhat alleviated by counselling or psychotherapy but how many of you are looking out for the impact of involuntarily childlessness on your friends or family before it gets to this stage i do hope those of you who have children and grandchildren might reflect a bit more on this issue after reading bibis courageous piece of writing derryn ellingham norfolk bibi lynch powerfully illustrates the prejudice and hurt experienced by women who are not mothers she gives several examples of the ignorance and assumptions people make about this group it is a shame then that she ends her article by making a gross assumption herself a man ejaculating in you does not make you kinder or wiser or more valid than me of course she is correct however a substantial minority of women become mothers without men ejaculating into them but via other means such as ivf selfinsemination by adopting children or through surrogacy to argue for the rights of one group whilst stereotyping the other unhelpfully detracts from the important point she is trying to make dr laura golding chorlton manchester many things are crushing and exhausting not least treading on eggshells around people who seem determined to read what was never meant into the most innocent remarks what has happened to our sensibilities and ability to discern what is a deliberately insensitive or hurtful remark when we seem to be incapable or unwilling to accept that most people are not trying to score a point or denigrate but are just unaware of our personal circumstances or feelings perhaps more tolerance on all sides would make life a little less fraught linda marriott lincoln join the

i am in my s an only child married with one child and another on the way i see my parents once or twice a year i live abroad over the past few years my father has been dressing transexually he now wears female clothing full time after seeing the rather undeniable wearing of a bra i asked mum about it she stifled her tears and said she didnt know he wont talk about it i cant ask them about it during one of our visits because our time together is limited and i dont want to ruin it during one visit three years ago i wrote them a letter and gave it to them at the end of their stay ive always been better at written communication asking them to keep it for when they got home they sat down and talked about it he told my mother he used to play dressingup with his older sisters clothes until one day he was caught by his quite strict parents berated and told to never do it again hes not talked about it since i dont know if he does it because he feels like a woman inside or if he prefers the cut and luxury of female clothing i feel hes been bottling up something big for most of his life and now feels sod it im doing what i want my dad doesnt talk he cant say or do the right thing my mother has become excruciatingly bitter towards him and generally very negative towards everyone and everything our time together already extremely limited has become horrific over the years i have written to them twice pleading to take some kind of action reminding them that i am their daughter not their relationship counsellor i dont know what to do to get them to move forward should i do something is it up to me your much longer letter was extremely eloquent and full of detail i can see this is a desperately unhappy situation for all of you i contacted juliet newbigin a psychoanalytic psychotherapist with an interest in sexual and gender identity bpcorguk she feels there are three issues first that of your inability to communicate with your parents other than via writing to them second the marital problem between your parents and third your fathers crossdressing crossdressing is not a problem per se but it is causing one here newbigin also notes that there is something that has made you pull away quite early from your parents you chose to go to boarding school you chose to live abroad she wonders whether you had noted some difficulty between your parents early on and wanted to protect yourself it isnt your job to sort this out you are right you are not their marriage counsellor so stop trying to be whats going on with your parents is deeprooted and they cant move forward healthily without kind and compassionate discussion but it is neither your job to instigate this nor chair it why cant you ask more directly and sympathetically what is going on with your dad asks newbigin there seems to be a wish to shut this down rather than find out who he is i am guessing its because of the questions crossdressing throws up for your mum it isnt something that has been discussed between them so its incredibly excluding for her plus she probably finds it very confusing people often mistake crossdressing for homosexuality but heterosexual men also crossdress the reasons for crossdressing are many and varied as well as a source of excitement it can be a way of relieving stress suggests newbigin something a person can be driven to for reasons that he may not be able to explain did your parents have problems before the crossdressing to move forward newbigin feels that you could get yourself some support to think through your relationship with your parents you say in your longer letter you have tried to encourage your parents to get therapy and they haventwont i saw that you are aware of crossdressing organisations but i wonder if you have heard of the beaumont society beaumontsocietyorguk which offers support to partners of crossdressers your mother says newbigin would really benefit from talking to someone it sounds as if you have more opportunity to talk to your mother so perhaps you could mention this organisation to her but of course you cant contact them yourself you need to talk facetoface with your parents one at a time is probably best letters are wonderful up to a point not to marriage guidance them but to try to get your relationship on a more honest footing you are afraid of ruining things but the situation sounds fraught already it doesnt have to be about the crossdressing and shouldnt be about their marriage thats counsellor mode you could try with your dad to find out where hes at get beyond the thing to the emotions something like how does life feel to you right now is a good opener why do you crossdress is too big a question and he may not know the answer if they wont talk about it you have to draw a line not under this but around it continue to talk to them of course and see if you can do without upsetting yourself but you may need to see beyond their marital problems and the crossdressing to the parents

i am the eldest of four children of a single mother i have two sisters and a brother who is the second child he is now but does not have a career friends or money he still lives at home with our mother and does not contribute to bills our mother worked hard for us and we never went without there were money problems but the rest of us were resilient enough to deal with them we three girls have careers partners and children and have been living independently for years my brother however plays the victim card for example he blames my mum for pushing him into the wrong degree not true he has done odd jobs over the years he worked in one place for a long time but refused to go for higherpaying management positions he feels he is too intelligent for such roles this has gone on for the past years he is perpetually angry abusive and belligerent with us when he is around nonfamily members he is charming but with us he is rude and aggressive he shouts at and abuses my mum and my biggest fear is that he will hit her one day as a family we have offered to pay for counselling he refused we have given him money and bought him things but he doesnt appreciate it he seems to think he has suffered some kind of injustice in life he doesnt take any responsibility for his life and even now will say that his predicament is everyone elses fault he refers to things that happened years ago and makes things up from the past to justify his victim status he will say that we ruined his life and its because he did what we wanted he has been given opportunities to live away from home but refuses he lives with my mum while resenting and blaming her i have told my mum to kick him out but she is reluctant i dont know how to make her be stronger he acts like a baby so she treats him like one she was not this soft on the rest of us especially me i no longer speak to my brother i have said my mum should say that he should have therapy or move out if he ends up on the streets so be it we have tried for years i am sick of it my mum is in her s she no longer has the strength for the arguments i wasnt sure how seriously worried you were about your mother being hit as it wasnt the focus of your much longer letter if your mother is ever in danger she must dial assault is a criminal offence i have also put a link at the bottom of the column which you may find useful regarding the other aspects of abuse you mention i wonder if growing up you had to adopt a mothering role with your brother you seem to have more of a parental relationship with him rather than a sibling one how do your sisters feel where iswas your dad when did he leave the picture and why sometimes its what you cant see what isnt mentioned that is incredibly relevant i contacted psychotherapist leila bargawi childpsychotherapyorguk who notes that you seem quite critical that he wasnt more resilient there does seem to be a lot of disdain for him the only boy bargawi also wonders if there was a narrative in your family about the men being losers maybe they were but if it were presented as a gender rather than personspecific thing men are hopeless women are resourceful and resilient that may have had a big impact on all of you but especially on your brother growing up without it seems a positive male role model bargawi also wonders if somewhere along the line unconsciously your mother and brother were company for one another and if in some way your brother has actually protected you all he was the one who stayed at home while you were all able to go and do your own thing maybe your brother felt overly responsible towards your mother hence him saying that he did what you all wanted him to maybe this responsibility has now turned to resentment there is something quite adolescent in your brothers behaviour notes bargawi who says his emotional development may not have gone to plan and we both wondered if in some way subconsciously your mother was getting something out of him being at home and vice versa despite his anger this will seem incredible but nowhere in your letter did i get a sense of how your mother felt about all this only about how you feel your mother by your own admission is reluctant to chuck him out what can you do well you cannot make your mum chuck him out any more than one of your children in the future could make you throw out one of their siblings bargawi suggests that perhaps you can find it in you to be supportive maybe remember a time in childhood when you got on if he is always going on about his childhood maybe there is something about that time that he needs to unpack i think you need to ask yourself some questions why am i so angry with my brother what do i want to achieve and is it achievable and what would happen if i did

judge a nation and its future on the way it treats its poorest children no government should stand by while more and more children grow up hungry or homeless yet that is what is happening here in britain in the st century already one in four of our children live in poverty and the institute for fiscal studies warns we are about to see the biggest increase in child poverty in a generation that is the backdrop to the governments decision to abolish the child poverty unit as uncovered by my labour colleague dan jarvis it may not sound like a big deal but it follows on from the abolition of the child poverty income targets and a series of policies that have hit lowincome families for all that theresa may has the right words on helping families her government has the wrong policies and a fundamentally flawed view of how to tackle poverty and injustice conservative ministers argue that government should focus not on family income but look instead at the root causes of poverty particularly parental worklessness and educational attainment but its not eitheror labour tried to do both thats why we set up the child poverty unit to coordinate action across every department and im worried that its abolition means the conservatives now plan to do neither contrary to conservative rhetoric the work the child poverty unit did under labour was on the causes of poverty before child poverty had risen steeply for years after tony blairs speech calling for an end to child poverty ministers from across government worked on a plan for change childcare and targeted employment support helped hundreds of thousands of people get into work as a result of the major expansion of childcare and targeted employment support as health minister in i worked with the child poverty unit on teenage pregnancy strategy halving the number of teen mums in a decade and the roll out of sure start childrens centres as housing minister i worked with the unit on getting families out of bedandbreakfast accommodation and into secure homes new policies on tackling domestic violence and improving literacy and numeracy in schools all had an impact if the conservatives had chosen to boost that work on the root causes of poverty that would have been a help instead sure start centres have closed homelessness is rising inequality is widening and now the unit tasked with drawing up a strategy has gone just getting parents into work isnt enough when more than half of the children now living in poverty are in working families or when parents are too sick or disabled to work focusing on educational attainment is really important but progress will always be limited if children cant do their maths homework or concentrate on exam revision because they dont have a roof over their heads nor will it ever work to ignore family income money matters and the only people who think it doesnt are those who have always had plenty of it if kids grow up feeling cold or hungry of course they do worse at school if children cant go on school trips or afford the books or opportunities others have of course they fall behind if parents are forced to depend on food banks to put a hot meal on the table that insecurity and anxiety they feel affects the children too all the evidence shows that both absolute and relative income poverty affect childrens chances in life and affect their lives for decades to come thats why gordon brown brought in tax credits and why labour introduced the national minimum wage as a result of all that work absolute poverty halved and children were lifted out of relative poverty but the regressive budgets that this government has brought in since including huge cuts to tax credits and child benefit are blighting our childrens future and like many mps i am very worried about what is to come when universal credit is rolled out next year just before the election i worked with other ministers to bring in the child poverty act embedding targets into law and requiring the government to take action each year it was our attempt to build crossparty consensus and ensure progress no matter which party was in power thats what we need again now fail to help children and we are failing not just them but our future if theresa may really wants to show she cares about working families she should start january by rethinking universal credit start february by backing dan jarviss private members bill and drawing up a new crossgovernment plan and start march with a budget to help working families helping children in poverty just needs the political will,2016-12,judge nation future way treat poorest child government stand child grow hungry homeless yet happening britain st century already one four child live poverty institute fiscal

more than half of the harm caused by domestic violence offenders in western australia was perpetrated by just people according to a report commissioned by western australian police the report by the cambridge centre for evidencebased policing used a harm index based on time spent in prison to analyse the offences of people charged in relation to cases of domestic and family violence in wa between and using that crime harm index it found that of offenders were responsible for of the harm it dubbed that group the powerful few the youngest of the people dubbed the worst offenders was years old and of them were under the age of the youngest person charged with any domestic violence offence was seven years old however the methodology has been questioned by domestic violence experts who say it underplays the harm caused by domestic violence that does not result in either murder or a serious reported assault according to the cambridge crime harm index scale which is based on average jail terms in britain murder is assigned points while domestic violence is points the same as burglary or motor vehicle theft arson is worth points threatening behaviour is and property damage is two curtin universitys prof donna chung said while murder was undoubtedly the most serious and harmful offence the index did not recognise the harm caused by having an intimate partner threaten you smash a window in your house or even commit an ordinary domestic assault the emphasis is on physical harm for which there is evidence and meets the requirement of the criminal law chung told guardian australia thats a very narrow definition of harm harm in this index doesnt include women having ptsd for the next years which can prevent them from working and cause them to live in poverty chung said the report also only included domestic violence cases as verified by police which she said was just a proportion of cases overall between and of all domestic violence incidents are not reported to police she said obviously if you kill someone its going to come to the attention of the police but anything short of that it may not go to them she said according to the cambridge report of the most serious offenders had no prior record for domestic violence when they committed their most serious offence it also said very few were charged by police with subsequent domestic violence offences and said there was no evidence that the severity of domestic violence offences escalated over time or that there was a link between an escalation of violence and murder there was a link between offenders who made threats or attempts of suicide and murder or attempted murder the report said but that was based on a sample of people the report recommended greater information sharing between police and mental health services to try to identify suicidal ideation as a risk factor and also recommended extensive and aggressive monitoring of the powerful few offenders including potentially using gps tracking ankle monitors it said the list of the worst offenders should be continually updated and sent to all local police stations the deputy police commissioner stephen brown said the report provided the evidence that a change in thinking is needed while treating every family and domestic violence matter appropriately we need to get the focus and balance right if we are serious about saving lives preventing serious injury and reducing the number of victims brown said in a statement chung also agreed with those recommendations but questioned the use of the term powerful few saying that although it was a statistical term in this case it could be interpreted as heroicising the most violent offenders these are men that like to feel powerful she said,2016-12,half harm caused

the femicide census report launched earlier this month provides important insights into the epidemic of women killed by men in england and wales but it was disappointing to see karen ingala smith of nia using this to further an agenda about the criminalisation of sex buyers why does a woman stay with a violent man sometimes to save her life theguardiancom december violence against women is one of the factors at play when female sex workers are killed but large amounts of evidence from around the world have shown that another major factor is the criminalisation of those involved in the sex industry ingala smith isolated the death of daria pionko here in leeds as a reason why the purchase of sex should be criminalised pionko was murdered since the development of a new approach to street sex work women can work in a designated area of the city without being prosecuted for soliciting what ingala smith didnt mention was that four sex workers have been killed in leeds since three under a policy of criminalisation of sex workers and buyers pionko was a migrant sex worker of uk sex workers murdered since more than half have been migrant women indicating a targeting of vulnerability exacerbated by criminalisation and stigmatisation under the new approach we have seen a fold increase in crimes against sex workers reported to police and have secured convictions for violent crimes never achieved before the femicide census is all about understanding the killings of women in context it was a shame to see the context of sex worker murders stripped away to argue for the

new figures from the office for national statistics showing that one in recorded crimes is domestic abuse may be shocking to some but for the abused women themselves or those working with them they simply bear out what is already known while statistics are extremely valuable when trying to understand the scale of social problems such as domestic abuse it is important to remember that they do not always give us the full picture domestic abuse is a largely invisible crime occurring mainly behind closed doors it is often difficult to measure it accurately and women are often reluctant or afraid to report it to the police many women whose experiences of domestic abuse are confined to psychological or coercive abuse may not even define themselves as abused women since there is little education about what nonviolent abuse consists of it is important to point out that domestic abuse affects both men and women but the numbers of women affected are higher the british crime survey statistical bulletin has reported that domestic abuse affects one in four women and one in six men accounts for of all violent crime and has more repeat victims than any other crime on average there are assaults before a victim calls the police additionally domestic abuse leads to an average of women and men per year being murdered thus women continue to be overrepresented as victims of domestic violence suffering physical verbal social financial and emotional violence the true number of abused people is likely to be far higher than the statistics suggest it is also certain to include many women facing other difficulties including homelessness my own research found that in the uk hungary sweden and spain of women in one sample reported sleeping rough as a direct result of domestic abuse this confirmed earlier findings of the connection between abuse and homelessness with of women interviewed for another project reporting either abuse from a partner or within the family home my husband would throw me out at night when he was drunk i slept in a cupboard behind the local freezer shop my husband broke my ribs tore my hair out perforated my ear drum and head butted me eventually i reported him and he was sent to prison i have a permanent nonmolestation order against him was how one woman described her experiences another said i needed to get out of the house because of sexual abuse by my father he sexually abused all his daughters including me i think my mother knew but did nothing about it i left my husband who also abused me physically and slept rough for years with homelessness in the uk now on the rise this connection gives further cause for concern about the impact of abuse on women but with the connection with homelessness still not widely recognised domestic abuse is still a largely hidden problem to which the criminal justice system takes a mainly reactive approach when what is needed is an evidencebased problemsolving and preventive one however good the criminal justice system becomes at dealing with domestic abuse arresting and prosecuting people on its own will not solve the problem but only manages it solutions need to start much earlier and include targeted interventions for example education during childhood and early adulthood could help to break down taboos and to challenge the normalisation of domestic abuse both in terms of its nature and prevalence educating new generations of young people about the nature of healthy relationships mutual respect and the links between violent homes unstable relationships and ensuing health problems as well as emphasising that domestic abuse is a crime and not a part of ordinary family life this approach has been successfully adopted in relation to homelessness by tamworth borough council housing department with their homelessness education programme this is designed to prevent homelessness by educating young people to make informed decisions about their housing situation and is delivered via sessions in reception year six and in high schools a similar approach could be taken to domestic abuse education helping to eliminate some of the myths and taboos which currently surround it as well as the propensity for victim blaming holding the victim wholly or partially responsible for what has happened to them within domestic situations wider society and in the courts only this month justice gilbart sitting at manchester crown court commented that a woman had left herself open to a sexual assault by being foolish and drinking too much minimising perpetrator accountability in this way and the use of victimblaming terms highlights the need to educate not just the young but criminal justice staff and wider society about the importance of domestic abuse and the language used to describe it of course the new statistics are concerning but in looking at domestic abuse we need to move beyond crime figures although advert campaigns have been launched by the government to educate young people about the unacceptability of violence in relationships there are still no national standards to protect womens safety or to make sure that local councils work together so womens safety is not disproportionately affected by the funding cuts that have taken place labours view is that m could be saved from the abolition of police and crime commissioners and used to set up a national womens refuge fund issues surrounding domestic abuse need to be higher on the governments policy agenda together with more relationship education and a commitment from those involved in such cases within the criminal justice system to having the right skills and training to protect the vulnerable such measures would go a long way to helping end domestic violence,2016-12,new figure office national statistic showing one recorded crime domestic abuse may shocking abused woman working simply bear already known statistic extremely valuable trying

when just a few weeks before the general election the conservative party announced that it would be introducing hours of socalled free childcare for working parents in england promptly overshadowing labours own hour pledge parents rejoiced in a country where parents can spend more on childcare than they do on their mortgages this offer was seen as a lifeline for many families unfortunately the closer we get to the september rollout of the extended offer the clearer it becomes that this policy has been rushed through is ill thought out and crucially is massively underfunded earlier this month the government published a disappointing response to the longawaited consultation on earlyyears funding despite repeated warnings from the earlyyears sector that the hour offer is not being properly financed the department for education confirmed that it is ploughing ahead with its ambitious plans what makes this so frustrating is that the problem of earlyyears underfunding is not new for years the amount that the government pays providers nurseries schools preschools and childminders to deliver earlyyears places hasnt come close to covering the actual cost meaning that providers lose money on every free hour they provide as it stands all three and fouryearolds and the most disadvantaged of twoyearolds in england can receive hours of governmentfunded early education and childcare a week but independent research commissioned by the preschool learning alliance pla in found that for every five children currently accessing funded places as part of the hour offer government funding only covers four so you can imagine our frustration when instead of addressing this problem the government in a fit of preelection pledgemaking decided to exacerbate it a government review of the cost of delivering childcare places prompted a small increase in average funding rates but nowhere near enough to plug the funding shortfall in fact in its consultation response the government confirmed that of local areas will actually see their earlyyears funding decrease when the new funding rates come into effect in april worse still the government has confirmed that these new funding rates rates that so many have warned are insufficient will be fixed until even as national minimum and living wages mortgages rents utilities and other business costs inevitably rise last week the government admitted that it has no plans to formally review the costs of delivering childcare and earlyyears education in what world is this an acceptable approach to policymaking especially for the delivery of a flagship manifesto pledge the government cannot shut its eyes and hope this problem goes away without sufficient funding were likely to see more and more earlyyears providers restricting the number of funded places they offer if not opting out of the scheme completely in order to stay in business and consequently more and more parents struggling to find a free place for their child the simple fact is that the hour offer can only work if government funding actually covers the costs of delivering earlyyears places something that the plas fair future funding campaign is calling on the government to ensure this is not about asking for endless investment its about the government committing itself to properly funding a pledge that it chose to make and its not about taxpayers paying for other peoples children to be looked after its about investing in quality early education just as we do for statefunded primary and secondary education either the government can afford to fund this policy properly or it cant and if it cant it needs to come clean and admit that the childcare it is offering parents isnt free after all but merely subsidised this is a government that has talked a lot about life chances about closing the gap and ensuring that all children get the best start in life and yet somehow we are in a situation where its childcare policy is falling apart at the seams childrens centre closures are on the rise and no one seems to be willing to admit theres a problem if the government is truly committed to supporting children and families its

i am and my relationship with my parents is gradually becoming nonexistent i am consumed with resentment during my childhood i had a close bond with my mother my father has always been a distant figure i have an older sister who has always felt out of bounds and resentful i dont recall having particularly close bonds with other children but was friendly secondary school marked a downturn my fading memory is of feeling constantly tense and staring down at my feet i was horrendously bullied every aspect of me was unacceptable to others i was fat and gay i became withdrawn my grades slipped the bullying would froth up until i would explode at home and my parents would go to the school this pattern would repeat until i left i left sixth form with terrible grades after school i felt awful awash and clueless my sister told me i was useless and could never achieve anything i took myself back to college got some qualifications went to university and had total financial independence i finished my masters six years ago graduating into the depths of a recession i was obsessed with job hunting i constantly scrutinised my cv and watched videos on interview techniques i felt lost betrayed by my own hard work and determination i had a meltdown one evening and raged at my parents for their lack of interest and lack of emotional and financial support my mother comforted me my dad watched tv my sister under instruction from my mother got me a fulltime job answering phones and my mother was ecstatic i was grateful for the money but it felt like a huge step back i pushed even harder for a job using my qualifications despite being scolded by my family for going to interviews within weeks i got a job i had wanted since i was when i told my parents my mother said you wont be able to afford to live by yourself i moved back to the family home to pay off all the debt i accumulated during and after university and have also managed to save up a few thousand pounds but not quite enough for a deposit for a house despite the seemingly happy ending i feel exhausted i grieve for my s as i spent much of them struggling financially and feeling awash with no direction and no hope everything i have done i have done through sheer determination and bloodymindedness i am gritting my teeth and stashing money away for a mortgage i wonder if i am being spoilt part of me does not care any more and i wonder if i should leave and cut ties my unstable job and the sensible part of me that is saving keeps me here but if i am honest my family make me feel desperately unhappy i dont think youre being spoilt i had to heavily edit your longer letter but one thing that really struck me was the pushpull in your family and the way for some reason you are kept very much in your place i turned to dr myrna gower a family psychotherapist aftorguk she thought you had obviously been a very important child but that your relationship with your mother may have been exclusive and so prevented you from having gone through any of lifes expected developmental transitions it doesnt seem as if you were encouraged to be independent or make your own way this may not have been done on purpose and it doesnt mean it wasnt done out of love but you seem to have been held back the pattern of attachment explains gower doesnt permit your natural evolution your mothers warnings seem to confirm your worst doubts about yourself we went through your letter carefully and it seems that at every point of independence something has called you back into the family you were reabsorbed says gower was it a sense of duty responsibility a lack of belief in yourself that your family in some way reinforced being at home makes you unhappy you dont seem to be yourself at home so you are denying yourself and that can make a person feel utterly wretched gower feels that you are asking permission to be an adult and be independent and actually its not about should you but that you have to be what you have done is incredible you must have an amazing strength of character when you are away from family influence you seem to fly but something about being home reverses this youve really got something about you says gower your parents should be proud you should be proud despite what i would say is a fairly suffocating home environment even loving ones can be you have not only survived but also flourished im not surprised you feel exhausted your s were a struggle but i believe your s could be the time everything comes together for you both gower and i feel it is important you leave home as soon as you are able to your family may not like this change because you are challenging established positions but you need to do it to be who you are and to continue to grow you too may find it difficult i fear you may feel disloyal but try not to you can leave home and grow and be your own person without cutting ties you can still be part of a family without being fused with it every week

if you are a female traffic warden or probation officer read on for good news if you are a female chief executive you may want to look away now the uks stubbornly wide gender pay gap is wellknown almost half a century on from the gender pay act there is still an difference in average pay between men and women of course such average figures for all employees tell a narrow story they dont for example account for the fact more women work in lowerpaid jobs or sectors but now people can quickly look up how things stand between the sexes in their particular job with a new interactive tool from the office for national statistics ons it also shows how many women and men work in each role for example women classed as chief executives and senior officials are paid less than men in that group at an hour versus an hour for men women hold of those jobs its a similar story among bank managers women classed as financial institution managers and directors earn less than men the onss own staff might well have been disappointed with the results on actuaries statisticians and economists where women are paid less than men things look better for cleaners nurses bar staff and further education teachers where the gap is zero the pay gap goes the other way in some jobs female probation officers earn more than men women in parking and civil enforcement occupations earn more while female physiotherapists are paid more the ons adds a word of caution to its new tool the pay gap figures do not reveal differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs so where there is a gap for your occupation this does not mean men are getting more than women for exactly the same work as the statisticians point out the reasons for the pay gap are more complex and include the fact women are more likely to work part time which can mean a lower rate of pay women are also underrepresented in senior roles something which may be down to peoples attitudes to gender roles lack of flexible working or women taking time to look after their family the tool was a joint project with the government equalities office and comes ahead of new rules next april that will force large employers to report their gender pay and gender bonus gaps the regulations will affect almost employers with about million employees launching the new pay gap checker the minister for women and equalities justine greening noted that the gender pay gap was now the lowest on record and that there were more women in work than ever before but if we are to help women to reach their potential and eliminate the gender pay gap we need to shine a light on our workplaces to see where there is more to do she said this tool will empower both men and women to challenge this issue in their profession and help people to make more informed decisions about their career employers must play their part in this too and take action to tackle the gender pay gap in their organisation,2016-12,female traffic warden probation officer read

australias largest study into family violence against migrant women has found they are already isolated by visa restrictions and language barriers and vulnerable to being controlled by their abusers the twoyear aspire project a joint effort by the university of melbourne the multicultural centre for womens health and the university of tasmania took in the experiences of immigrant and refugee women from more than countries who had survived family violence twentysix focus groups with men and women were held for the study and nearly workers from family violence settlement and the law and justice sectors were interviewed cathy vaughan of the university of melbournes centre for health equity who led the study said many of the women could not work or access social security or health services because of visa restrictions in many cases their isolation would be manipulated by their partners who would forbid them from learning english or how to drive or choose to live in remote areas the women also reported extensive financial abuse and coercion over their immigration status the process of migration is often associated with isolation because youre dislocated vaughan told guardian australia thats compounded when you dont speak the language of the country that youre moving to and if youre completely dependent on someone who sponsored your visa in particular theyve got a lot more

arriving in australia for an arranged marriage was taken to a house in the northern suburbs of melbourne where the only people she knew were her partner and his family within days she was experiencing severe violence including being choked many of the women were completely dependent on their partner which made it very difficult for them to leave the relationship said vaughan the cultural backgrounds of abusers varied some were angloaustralians a bill amending the migration act to prevent serious family violence offenders from sponsoring a partner to come to australia is currently before the senate the immigration minister peter dutton said it was a very significant first step in protecting potentially vulnerable visa applicants from the risk of domestic violence but vaughan said even if the amendment passed underreporting of family violence indicated there would still be atrisk women coming to australia on partner visas these men entice women here with false promises and then expect what is essentially domestic servitude she said some women end up victims of extreme physical and sexual violence as well they are essentially brought out here as slaves few women were aware of family violence prevention programs or response services which were broadly found to be underresourced and in high demand some of those who did seek help reported problems communicating and accessing information even with the use of interpreters one woman sought help at a family violence service telling the interpreter that her husband punched her and made her beg for money but the interpreter did not translate her words accurately instead telling her you bring shame on our community i will tell your family you were here many women reported feeling dismissed disbelieved blamed and discriminated against by police officers adele murdolo the executive director of the multicultural centre for womens health hoped the findings would prompt community services and state and federal

incidents of domestic abuse mostly involving violent attacks on women make up one in crimes recorded by the police and account for onethird of all reported violent crimes according to the latest office for national statistics research in the year to march million women and men were victims of domestic abuse according to the crime survey for england and wales the overwhelming majority of incidents involved violent attacks the ons figures confirm that domestic murders are overwhelmingly perpetrated by men against women labelled by some womens campaigners as femicide the ons said there were domestic homicides recorded by police between april and march of which victims were women and were men domestic homicides represent a third of all murders in england and wales overall twothirds of all murder victims are male among women murdered by a partner or expartner were killed by a man while among male domestic homicide victims only a third were killed by a woman the ons figures also reveal that domestic abuse is most common in the west midlands at a rate of cases per adults and wales at and lowest in london at the highest rates by police force area are in suffolk and cleveland and the lowest in surrey and london an estimated million adults aged to experienced domestic abuse in the last year equating to a prevalence rate of six in adults the ons said women were more likely to say they have experienced domestic abuse than men however the difference between the number of male and female victims is at its lowest compared with previous years the trend in the prevalence of domestic abuse has remained fairly stable since the year ending march but is at its lowest since the year ending march it said a large proportion of domestic abuserelated incidents were reported to and recorded by the police m of the m and after investigations the police concluded in of these cases that a domestic abuserelated criminal offence had been committed a decision to charge was made in of domestic abuserelated cases referred by police to the crown prosecution service convictions were secured in threequarters of domestic abuserelated prosecutions in of the domestic abuse cases referred to the cps the defendant pleaded guilty so most of the cases recorded as successful outcomes were due to guilty pleas it is harrowing to learn that last year nearly million adults experienced domestic abuse including one in eight women aged to said lucy hastings of the charity victim support that the prevalence is so high among this age group demonstrates the importance of highquality sex and relationships education being available to equip young people with the tools they need to understand healthy relationships make safe choices and know how to seek advice and support louisa rolfe the national police chiefs council lead on domestic abuse said the better our data the better we understand domestic abuse as a crime and the more we can do to support victims and prevent harm which is what really matters however this is only the first phase of a wider project and caution must be taken when interpreting the data or trying to make direct comparisons across different organisations methodologies and points in time for now it should be used to stimulate thought rather than draw conclusions she said the statistics do not currently represent the extent of our commitment to tackling domestic abuse and the scale of the challenge we face adding it is still far too acceptable in society reports to the police are continuing to rise and the gap between experienced crime and recorded crime is narrowing it is good to see more victims having the confidence to come forward and start to take back control from those who seek to control and intimidate them domestic abuse is a serious crime and never the fault of the victim we are here to help,2016-12,incident domestic abuse mostly involving violent attack woman make one crime recorded police account onethird reported violent crime

labour and an earlyyears charity have expressed alarm after government figures showed that sure start childrens centres closed in england in almost double the number which shut the previous year the labour mp dan jarvis who used a written parliamentary question to get the figures from caroline dinenage the junior education minister said the closures were deeply concerning and called on dinenage to explain the situation to parliament the preschool learning alliance which campaigns on early years issues said the scale of closures appeared to run counter to the governments narrative on improving life chances across society sure start centres were launched by the then labour government in with a particular remit to provide early help to infants from disadvantaged backgrounds before they started school dinenages answer showed that increasing numbers of the centres had shut under the coalition and conservative governments with closing in in and in in the number increased to and then last year as of october this year there were main childrens centres remaining she added the department for education has previously explained closures of sure start centres by saying many of the cuts involve reorganisations or mergers denying any largescale reduction in capacity but jarvis said the government needed to explain the figures sure start centres are a proven success he said they provide families with childcare in addition to being a onestop shop for extra support with things like healthcare or securing job opportunities this shows how wrong the conservatives priorities are because every sure start centre that is lost closes a door on a childs chance to get on in life a childs earliest years are critical to their future life chances so early interventions like sure start should be the priority because it is a smart investment for the future and it will give children the best start in life with child poverty set to rise by over this parliament thousands of families will be affected by these closures we will all pay for this failure in years to come neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance said the figures were worrying childrens centres are a vital source of advice and practical support for families especially those more disadvantaged families and so for so many to be disappearing at a time when there is so much government rhetoric on closing the gap and improving childrens life chances seems completely contradictory he said worse still a growing number of those childrens centres that remain open are unable to offer much more than a skeleton service due to lack of adequate funding meaning that even more vulnerable families are finding it difficult to access the support they need this is clearly not a sustainable situation and so we urge the government to set out its now long overdue strategy for securing the future of childrens centres as a matter of priority a department for education spokeswoman said it remained committed to giving children the best start in life and was spending record amounts on childcare she said many councils are merging centres to allow services to be delivered more efficiently where they decide to close a childrens centre site they must demonstrate that the outcomes for children would not be adversely affected and will not compromise the duty to have sufficient childrens centres

nearly five years ago in january i noticed that there seemed to have been a lot of women killed during the first few days of the year i made a note of their names to help me work out just how many and then i just didnt stop it turned into the counting dead women project in partnership with womens aid and has led to the first femicide census report released today we sent foi requests for details of women killed by men to all police constabularies in england and wales and developed a database supported by freshfields bruckhaus deringer and deloitte as a result we now have information about women killed by men between and the men who killed them and the contexts of the killings most of the women or were killed by current or former partners confirming what is already known about which men are the main threat to the lives of women in england and wales the ones they love or loved we were able to find information showing that about onethird of these women were killed after leaving a partner of these were killed in the first year after separation in the first month its often asked of women with violent partners why doesnt she just leave for many women its because they know theyre safer with him than if they leave him he may have told her that he will kill her if she goes and she knows its true for some women staying with a violent man is a survival strategy having this detailed information highlights how important it is to have support including refuge accommodation for women to escape to it also reveals the lasting legacy of stateenshrined inequality in relationships in very recent history women were viewed legally as the possessions of men and rape within marriage was only criminalised in england and wales in there are too many men who havent moved on from that one of the most important things about the femicide census is that we look beyond intimate partner violence to fatal violence from other male family members from sons from strangers and including men who pay for sex doing this helps us see the bigger picture identifying the commonalties across the different contexts of mens violence against women can help us see its root causes this is essential if were really serious about reducing mens violence against women and girls continuing to improve policing and justice responses is vital but these alone wont bring about the reduction in mens violence against women that we want if we dont change the attitudes and inequality that foster it we know that at least of the women killed had links to prostitution or pornography and we think this will be an undercount in my opinion prostitution is financially compensated rape and prostitution and pornography are eroticised inequality you cant have one sex overwhelmingly sold as a commodity and the other the purchaser without sex inequality and without reinforcing that inequality the objectification of women feeds the entitlement of men and simultaneously reduces the status of women for this reason so called prostitution managed zones such as the one in leeds in which yearold daria pionko was murdered last december are not a solution prostitution and womens safety are contradictory recognising the influence of male entitlement on mens violence against women shows us that not only is it essential to have wellresourced exiting services for women in prostitution but also that we need to tackle mens attitudes and we can do this by targeting their demand and access no woman killed by a man is just a statistic there should be no hierarchy of victims and every woman counts no matter what the circumstances of her life and death but looking at statistics presents opportunities for learning the femicide census both captures new information and provides evidence to support what we already know but it can only make a difference if this knowledge results in action we need to make sure we have independent specialist services provided and led by women we need to make sure our sexual and domestic violence services are securely funded so that they can focus on supporting women not chasing funding we need policing and a criminal justice system that delivers justice for women and wed very much like funding for the femicide census we also need a huge shift in attitudes to understand how socially constructed gender and the objectification of women is both a cause and consequence of inequality between the sexes to do this we could start by recognising that were not looking at isolated incidents across seven years but the manifestation of a deeper problem the femicide census is a

heres the problem with feminism it makes the holidays very hard particularly when it comes to giftgiving of course most women are content with something pink and expensive under the christmas tree but what about those feminists who demand presents that dont prop up the patriarchy gifts that dont give in to gender stereotypes trinkets that dont trade in transmisogyny and objects that dont objectify its a minefield basically and one you should tread carefully everyone knows feminists dont have a sense of humour thankfully there are already numerous gift guides tailored to the feminist in your life you know as opposed to all those other women who are not interested in equalgifting rights according to these guides feministfriendly presents include a uterus plush figure an informative tag describes the wonders of the womb a vagina charm necklace a bodypositive iphone case and period pants these are all bloody good suggestions dont get me wrong sometimes however a feminist just has more vagina charm necklaces than she knows what to do with so ive helpfully put together a few more ideas to help you close the gift gap this december a nice broomstick definitions of feminism can differ so its worth quickly recapping what the fword actually means pat robertson an american televangelist might have said it best when he described feminism as a movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practise witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians now i hate to make sweeping generalisations but if youre going to practise witchcraft then youre going to need a broomstick a witty slogan tshirt if youre a feminist but dont have a tshirt proclaiming youre a feminist are you really a feminist probably not women have never had so much freedom to purchase hideous tshirts that let the world know that they truly do buy into feminism with slogans such as girls just wanna have fundamental human rights who needs gender roles when we can have pizza rolls or ovaries before brovaries you can show the world how important it is to have equal access to terrible puns a mallet the bigger the better what did you think the patriarchy was going to topple itself a pinky ring if you like feminism you should put a ring on it more specifically you should put a pinky ring on it fredfar an labased jewellery company offers a selflove pinky ring billed as an antiengagement ring woman the website says reclaim yourself choose power choose fulfilment choose choice choose yourself if you think this sounds like some grade a bullshit rather than serious feminism id caution you not to be so cynical and have a little feminist faith buy a pinky ring and equal rights will undoubtedly follow some fancy makeup dont let anyone tell you that makeup is a foundation of patriarchal oppression makeup is war paint suffragettes suffered for our right to go to sephora and we should celebrate this freedom not debate it in case you still need convincing that eyeliner wont ruin your feminist credentials may i remind you that the nigerian writer and feminist role model chimamanda ngozi adichie is a beauty ambassador for boots no in a recent interview regarding this role adichie says that she wanted to be part of the message that women who like makeup also have important and serious things that theyre doing in their lives its time to really stop

more than women were killed by men in england and wales over a sixyear period most by their current or former partners according to the first detailed analysis of deadly male violence against women in those countries the femicide census which tracks and analyses the deaths of women killed by partners expartners male relatives acquaintances colleagues and strangers was developed by nia a charity dedicated to ending violence against women and womens aid between and women were killed by men the census found of these were killed by their current or former partners and by their sons polly neate the chief executive of womens aid said the killing of women especially when women are killed by an abusive partner or expartner is often reported as an isolated incident there is an abject failure to look at patterns of behaviour we accept fatal male violence as an inevitability not a conscious choice that a man has made to end a womans life this dangerous culture needs to change we need to learn the lessons and by viewing these cases of femicide altogether we can learn our initial analysis shows that these killings are not isolated incidents too many of them followed a similar pattern of violence and were premeditated many were committed in similar settings similar weapons were used and similar relationships existed between the perpetrators and victims just under half of the women were killed by knives a sharp instrument was used in cases of femicide defined as the killing of women because they are women killings of women by their partners in a domestic setting made up of those deaths women are at significant risk of deadly violence when they separate from an abusive partner the figures show about threequarters of women killed by their expartner or former spouse died within months of their separation women of any age can be victims of femicide the census found that women aged over were killed in england and wales over the period femicide is a leading cause of premature death for women but there is limited research on the issue according to the groups behind the census the global study on homicide by the un office on drugs and crime indicated that while there had been a decrease in the number of homicides worldwide the number of femicides had risen the femicide census was developed by karen ingala smith the chief executive of nia and womens aid with support from freshfields bruckhaus deringer llp and deloitte llp the partnership is calling on the government to take urgent action including ensuring that specialist domestic abuse and sexual violence services have sustainable longterm funding and funding is available for specialist projects for women to move away from prostitution they also want the relevant authorities to recognise that women are particularly at risk when leaving abusive relationships ingala smith said i started counting dead women back in january in the first three days of the year eight women were killed at mens hands three shot two stabbed two beaten and strangled and one women killed by her grandson inflicting blunt force trauma injuries i made a note of their names just to help me count and then once id started it didnt seem right to stop when can you say that the next woman doesnt count looking at official statistics it was overwhelmingly clear that we were not naming mans fatal violence against women and we

it is a question that has troubled parents down the years just how much time should they spend with their children when they are growing up now a new study suggests that the answer at least for mothers should be as much as they can afford to give the study by academics from the university of essex and university college london published in this weeks edition of the economic journal finds that a young childs cognitive and social skills are improved considerably by spending more time with their mother between the ages of three and seven it also found that firstborn children tend to benefit more from an early investment of their mothers time than siblings born after them the study is the first of its kind in the uk and one of the first in the world to examine directly the relationship between the time mothers spend with their children and the skills those children go on to develop it uses data from the uk millennium cohort study a nationally representative study of infants born in the uk between september and january the research which analyses representative data on more than children and their mothers found that the positive effect of mothers spending time with their children was large it was equivalent in magnitude to between and of the advantage that young children enjoy from having a mother with a university degree as opposed to having a mother with no qualifications our results emphasise that the time spent by mothers with their children has a noticeable influence on early child development said one of the coauthors of the study professor marco francesconi the researchers also found that the level of education attained by a mother has an effect on early years development time spent engaging in educational activities such as reading between the ages of three and five with a mother who has been educated beyond the minimum schoolleaving age leads to an increase in verbal skills at age seven that the authors suggest is significantly greater than achieved by children whose mothers are less well educated the authors acknowledged that their study fails to examine the role played by fathers this is because fathers nonresponse rates in the millennium cohort study were extremely high resulting in a paucity of data the studys publication will intensify the debate around working parents the government plans to extend entitlement in england to free childcare from to hours a week for children aged three and four but new research published by the institute for fiscal studies the university of essex and the university of warwick suggests that the measure will have only a small impact on parents working patterns the research funded by the economic and social research council found that increasing the offer of free childcare from to between and hours a week during term time had no noticeable impact on fathers working patterns or those of mothers with other children under the age of four the government expects to spend close to bn extending the number of free hours of childcare available to working parents of three and fouryearolds in england from to a week during term time said sarah cattan senior research economist at the ifs

my elder sister and i were extremely close when we were younger we are very near in age and while we bickered as teenagers we remained firm friends now we are adults in our s that has all changed and i fear that we have irrevocably lost what we once had i would love to get it back we moved around different cities after university but ended up in the same city hardly seeing each other now through a quirk of timing in tenancy agreements we are back living together you wouldnt know we are sisters from the way we interact at home we seem more like strangers when she is not out she is very insular and considers an evening or day alone in her room with the door shut time well spent i thrive and am dependent on company to invigorate me and resent that she doesnt care to constantly interact with me she needs time on her own regularly and as i am not this sort of person this is something i simply wont understand our differing food habits are also a big source of frustration she eats the same meal every day and never cooks which i find sad she will occasionally join me if i cook dinner but the favour is never returned i long for the sort of houseshare where people take it in turns to cook so there is always something nice to eat when you get home and where people spend their evenings chatting over dinner and maybe watching tv together but this never happens it especially upsets me that she doesnt join in if i have friends round her controlled personality can also lead to her being very controlling of me we have had serious arguments about such trivial things as her asking me to stop singing i refused because it is my home too and it makes me happy and moving items around in the fridge to fit things in which she doesnt like if it affects anything of hers i am finding it hard to come to terms with just how different we have become in adulthood i find her to be too rigid and controlled a bit of a snob and a health obsessive while im sure she thinks that i am irrational and overemotional and too dependent on others i am upset that we have lost our natural connection and i would like to be able to repair it while we still live together there seems to be this feeling that because you are sisters you should be similar and do many things together maybe this was the case when you were children but you dont seem to have separated out from your childhood personas and siblings are rarely similar even if they are genetically close i consulted peter wilson a psychotherapist childpsychotherapyorguk the first thing he said was i cant understand why you are living with each other i think this is exacerbating everything because it is forcing you and your differences together when all you can see are differences there seems to be no common ground on which to build when in fact there can be with a bit of perspective and negotiation what wilson also helped me to understand is that in adolescence even children who got on before can find themselves diverging everybodys adolescence is very different he explains and it is then that people tune in to their own individual personalities its when we start to discover who we are in other words all those things that tie us together with family can go through immense change in adolescence as we form our own identities and we can move apart from those with whom we grew up it doesnt mean your relationship with your sister is over your s can be a decade of great change and finding yourself you may discover that you reunite in a few years time but one thing is certain the way you are going about things now is not conducive to that happening read back over what you said and imagine it the other way around my sister wants me to constantly spend time with her and eat dinner with her and when she invites friends over she wants me to be with her she wont stop singing even though i have asked her you call her controlling but you sound very controlling of her see you do have some things in common i wondered where your rather idealised view of a sisterly relationship came from where are your parents has something happened to make you cling to your sister so its important counsels wilson to recognise your differences your sister may be in a different place look at where you are in your life and where else you can get that companionship i understand places to live arent easy to find but you need to separate out and find your own place or step back from trying to make your sister be all things to you sibling relationships go through many incarnations as with any relationship let this one breathe dont define yourself through it and invest in the many other friendships you seem to have i was also struck by something when you describe what you want it sounds very much like a home environment you may get that in a few years but it probably wont be your sister who provides it to the reader who wrote to me this week on coloured paper please contact the national domestic violence

what does a perpetrator of violence against women look like for many the question still evokes images of shadowy strangers pouncing in the dark or thuggish drunken husbands stumbling home from football matches stereotypes challenged tirelessly by womens organisations and campaigners especially throughout the current days of action against genderbased violence in reality women are statistically most likely to be assaulted by someone known to them and domestic abuse can be and is also perpetrated by handsome middleclass professionals busting myths is therefore a crucial tool in the fight against a culture which relies on them but for all these vital and urgent conversations about the true face of perpetrators there is one that remains largely invisible in spite of both ubiquity and power the state itself violence does not exist solely in the instant that blow meets body but in the circumstances that facilitate it and the systems which excuse it one needs only glance at violent crime statistics since to spot a sharp increase in violence affecting women correlating neatly with the introduction of austerity measures in the same year which have since seen womens refuges close and of womens organisations facing a funding crisis the subsequent diversion of the tampon tax into womens charities while widely hailed as a feminist victory in fact achieved little more than imposing the financial burden of their own health and support services on to women while men continue to enjoy statefunded mainstream care changes to the welfare system too illustrate at best a naivety around violence against women and at worst a complicity for all the widely acknowledged flaws of universal credit for example little has been made of the stipulation to pay it only to one head of household limiting the financial autonomy of women and gifting abusive partners ammunition by which to keep their victims hostage if economic policy too accurately embodies its violent language of slashing and cutting legislation around crime and justice delivers an almost laughable irony in some cases the very laws purportedly designed to protect women from violence can in practice enable it the criminalisation of various activities relating to the sale of sex for example is universally opposed by sex workerorganising collectives on the grounds that it limits their ability to work safely for instance in groups or designated zones and without fear of violence from both clients and state agencies when women do experience violence at the hands of a male perpetrator as in uk women will in their lifetimes a tangle of state systems and institutions make the path to justice anything but easy despite the criminalisation of such violence in law cuts to legal aid for instance disproportionately affect women bringing claims of sexual violence and domestic abuse and thats if they havent already been put off by the degrading and painful experiences that women before them have legally faced in the uk justice system or the countrys unrealistically low prosecution rate for genderbased violence womens experience of such statesanctioned violence does of course differ based on individual identities and predictably those also marginalised elsewhere are both hardest hit and affected in unique ways a lack of affordable housing trapping women in poverty in abusive relationships black women living in fear of police brutality trans women routinely placed into male prisons with little regard for their increased vulnerability to sexual violence and suicide there in particular refugee and migrant women remain especially at risk of state violence in large part through their interactions with detention centres like yarls wood where a protest tomorrow aims to oppose the inhumane treatment of detainees including the prevalence of sexual violence against women held in the facility these are the findings that theresa may then home secretary last year refused to disclose details of for fear of prejudicing commercial interests a stark assertion of exactly where this governments priorities lie when it comes to the safety of vulnerable women taken as a whole then the picture in the uk is one where women still face epidemic levels of violence but lack the support of a state which at best enables and at worst perpetrates it its time to move beyond an understanding of violence against women as a personal issue between individuals and see it as a strategy built into our institutions and society in order to maintain a status quo where women particularly the most marginalised are subordinated politicians are good at talking the talk no woman should live in fear of violence and every girl should grow up knowing she is safe reads mays foreword in the governments ending violence against women and girls strategy but until her own actions and that of her government say otherwise this noble vision remains far from realised,2016-12,doe perpetrator violence woman
