victims of domestic violence at risk of further abuse are being advised to sleep in occupy camps in police stations and accident and emergency departments because of sweeping cuts across the sector according to domestic violence charities on an average day last year women were turned away by womens aid around of those seeking refuge because of a lack of space the organisation has revealed and as further cuts begin to bite more women are likely to be put in danger said nicola harwin chief executive of womens aid the largest national organisation for domestic and sexual violence services freedom of information requests released in a major new report revealed that of funding to the sector was cut by local authorities between and a reduction from m to m harwin who has worked in refuge provision since the s said there was a real risk that four decades of progress in the sector could be lost we were one of the first countries in the world to create refuges we built up those blocks gradually and they are being taken down she said there is enormous determination resilience and passion in this sector but the pressure on services to meet these womens very complex needs is huge heather harvey research and development manager at eaves a londonbased domestic violence charity said it was becoming increasingly difficult to find a bed for vulnerable women we used to have a situation where we couldnt quickly place someone in emergency accommodation perhaps once a month now its happening two to three times a week she said support workers were forced to suggest places for women to sleep outside such as the occupy camps accident and emergency departments or night buses she added all you can say to some of them if you sleep on the street here are some ways of staying safe but of course there have been reports of rape at an occupy camp and you are only displacing the burden someone has to pick up the human and economic cost further down the line the situation was reaching crisis point she said women are literally having to find a way of staying safe on the streets or staying in violent relationships where they could end up dead and the ultimate costs of that are huge to the police the nhs the courts its a total false economy the effect on local services is both dramatic and uneven across localities according to the report commissioned by trust for london and the northern rock foundation specialist services are being particularly hardest hit with organisations with local authority funding of less than suffering an average cut of compared with for those receiving more than imkaan who run refuges for minority women were forced to close two of their six refuges losing local authority funding for two more hannana siddiqui of southall black sisters which provides support for black and ethnic minority bme victims of domestic violence and is in danger of losing up to half its staff next year said specialist services were too small to compete in new commissioning models that demand budget services as a result minority organisations were having to close or be absorbed by a larger group she said but we have built up the expertise to meet the needs of hardtoreach bme women and if you reduce the quality and quantity of provision that has serious implications more women are turned away there are more suicides more homicides more forced marriages a perfect storm of statutory cuts to police welfare housing and legal aid was also putting pressure on the sector with little being done to measure the impact on womens services said harwin changes in commissioning meant local authorities were increasingly choosing lowbudget services from nonspecialist providers she said every area is being hit and if all routes to safety are being cut back i believe we will see more tragedies more homicides and lots more women and children living in violent situations she said cuts to supporting people a government programme for vulnerable people with housing needs and legal aid were expected to disproportionately impact women while other specialised expertise including domestic abuse officers a unit on female genital mutilation and domestic violence courts had also been lost according to the report in other examples refuge a charity which provides emergency accommodation for women and children reported cuts to of their contracts respect a charity with works with perpetrators of domestic violence reported of services had lost specific projects while research from the womens resource centre found that one in five womens organisations have closed pdf and of those questioned believed funding cuts would lead to the closure of their organisation yvette cooper the shadow home secretary said the combination of pressures around commissioning and cuts to funding and statutory organisations motivated her to launch a commission on womens safety spearheaded by the former solicitor general vera baird these figures that show such a steep cut in such a short period of time are shocking she said i am deeply concerned about this it is putting women and children in danger and we risk turning back the clock on the important work that has been done to prevent women being put in lifethreatening situations she called on the government to urgently assess the impact of cuts and ensure every area had sufficient services for vulnerable women lynne featherstone the home office minister for equality who will speak at the womens aid agm on wednesday said the coalition had demonstrated that ending violence against women and girls was an absolute priority publishing an action plan to end violence against women and girls ringfencing m for domestic violence services and allocating m for rape crisis services and for domestic violence helplines featherstone called on local authorities not to make disproportionate cuts or look at the womens sector as a soft target for cuts these are tough times and everyone is dealing with cuts but this coalition government has sent out a very clear message about the importance and value it places on this sector i would rebut very firmly that the sector is in crisis this government is putting its best foot forward and is committed to ending violence against women and girls she said case study eaves recently struggled to help yearold linda and her monthold baby she fled to her mothers house after being physically abused by her partner but when she refused to return to him she was thrown out and left homeless the homeless peoples unit hpu of her local authority decided she was not a priority case and only provided lastminute bampb accomodation for two consecutive nights linda and her baby lingered in fast food restaurants and internet cafes to keep warm with her bags clearly visible in the pushchair she felt vulnerable and described the experience as really frightening this was nothing short of the most horrible and terrible time of my life she said when i was at my most vulnerable i was pushed away in the coldest manner by the hpu who told me that they had bigger priorities only when threatened with a judicial review did the council agreed to provide temporary accommodation in a hostel while they conducted an investigation support worker lorena fuentes said obviously she was a priority a young mother with a baby under a year old and fleeing a violent situation so we were stunned when the local hpu turned her away quite frankly i dont think this would have happened a year ago all this trying to dodge responsibility quite apart from being hugely stressful to the mother and baby is a pointless waste of everybodys time and money linda said without the help of the scarlet centre a dropin centre for women who have experienced domestic violence she would have been completely lost it makes me feel uncomfortable talking about it even now and i have a sick feeling in my stomach that wont go away the feeling of the stress and uncertainty of what was going to happen to me and my baby made me feel beyond desperate i would hate to think where we would be without them,2012-01,victim domestic violence risk abuse advised sleep

alison saunders one of the countrys leading prosecutors has drawn attention to the enduring myths that surround rape victims and in so doing questioned the performance of the criminal justice system in its prosecution of rape cases one raised concern in particular addressed the attitude pronouncements and decisionmaking of some trial judges special training for judges may not be a cure all for the challenges presented by rape cases but it represents a positive effort by the judiciary to address those issues in england and wales the judicial college is responsible for training judges who hear rape cases judges may only hear such cases if they complete the colleges threeday residential training programme every three years while this may initially appear to be a limited amount of training peter rook the former director of the serious sexual offences programme has pointed out that judges are under a continuing professional obligation to update their own knowledge it is important to note that judicial training is not intended to be the only source of information and updating with which members of the judiciary engage if they are to be effective officeholders then they themselves are expected to keep up to date as part of their professional responsibilities the current training prospectus explains that the trainings purpose is to provide those who try serious sexual offences with an opportunity to identify and address current legal evidential procedural social and sentencing issues it provides an update on current law and seeks to assist judges to develop their judicial skills in relation to the trial of serious sexual offences it recognises that an appropriately skilled judge requires not only an understanding of the blackletter law but also an awareness of relevant sociological and medical issues the subjects covered during the training include the law relating to sexual history evidence sentencing the use of measures such as live video links and intermediaries to help witnesses give best evidence the law pertaining to indecent images of children false rape allegations male victims of rape and the meaning of consent wider contextual issues that might be of importance in rape trials including delays in reporting and difficulties that some complainants have in recollecting traumatic events in a consistent manner are also discussed it is evident that the training is mindful in ensuring a fair trial for defendants as well as complainants the training comprises a mixture of lectures given by expert speakers mock trials and syndicates which comprise a dozen or so of the attending judges and are led by trained tutor judges the current course director nick browne has described the syndicate time as invaluable as it allows judges to express themselves in an uninhibited open and supportive manner there is evidence that the training works fiona masons work on the effects of rape on victims which is a regular feature of the course has been described by peter rook as having a significant impact on attendees indeed the court of appeal now permits uncontroversial judicial comment on such things as delayed reporting by a complainant when the judge directs a jury before it considers its verdict browne is also of the view that the training has had an impact on judicial attitudes there has been a sea change in attitudes and i think the training is dare i say it i think it is gradually working it is a slow and organic process but there is also recognition that any training course will have limitations there is always a risk that people come with preconceived ideas and then leave with the same preconceived ideas i am afraid that is possible nonetheless as a means of addressing some of the systems past defects

a few days ago a young domestic violence victim showed me a picture of the man who beat her he is advertising on an online dating website where he is described as family friendly by an online

is still excused hidden and accepted but no one would want their daughter relative or friend responding to this mans advertisement the idea of romantic love has a worrying relationship to domestic abuse and even homicide violence even fatal is often justified by claiming love for the victim it is also often accepted as mitigation in sentencing and to support attempts to reduce murder charges to manslaughter the idea that violence can be a sign of depth of love makes this mans advertisement all the more sinister the chief constable of wiltshire brian moore claims that there are some serial domestic abusers at large in the uk two women are killed every week in this country by their partners and former partners between four and a week commit suicide as a result of domestic abuse and one in four women will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime this is not a small problem domestic abuse is often well hidden within the romantic relationship but serial abusers should not be hidden we can have some say over their anonymity and clares law proposes giving individuals access to information about a new partners violent past the domestic violence disclosure scheme consultation process is now ended but campaigning continues wiltshire police propose that there is a right to know and a right to ask even arguing that there should be a responsibility on organisations who have information about dangerous individuals to proactively inform a new partner this approach would begin to watch these serial abusers and start to reveal their identities the concept of stalking the stalkers it also begins to send the message that such behaviour is no longer acceptable in modern society and challenges the archaic notion that love can be expressed in violence i cannot reveal the name of this abuser who advertises for love online neither can i reveal the name of the site i cannot help with the safety of any individual using the site and this saddens and frustrates me for i have the information similarly those who run online dating sites would probably reject this mans business if they knew he was a danger victims of domestic violence are often wrongly blamed for making poor choices about partners this unsophisticated view ignores the complexities and dynamics of abusive relationships and distracts attention from the culprit critically as the abuser i allude to shows prospective partners do not always tell the truth there is no doubt that dealing with the recurring and prevalent problem of domestic violence requires state action that should extend to sharing with victims information about the violent pasts of prospective partners so that victims can make informed decisions the debate on clares law unsettles some as it challenges protections that appear to be the bedrock of our justice system but in a technologydriven world crime is changing both in the ways it is committed and how potential victims are identified clares law represents a change that would make serial abusers visible some may argue that it will undermine their rights but i think that the right not to be beaten by your partner is a more important right,2012-01,day ago young domestic

the demonisation of young women is contributing to the failure to secure more convictions of suspected rapists one of the countrys leading prosecutors warns on monday some victims are deterred from coming forward because they fear they will be vilified says alison saunders the head of the crown prosecution service in london in an interview with the guardian saunders said she believed jurors were coming to court with preconceptions about women that affected the way they considered evidence these beliefs need to be challenged if more trials arent to end in acquittals saunders said prosecutors and detectives involved in rape cases were now trained to challenge myths and stereotypes particularly around women who have been drinking or those who say they have been sexually assaulted by a current or former partner we have done lots of training but there has never been that debate on a wider social basis you can see how some members of the jury can come along with preconceived ideas they might still subscribe to the myths and stereotypes that we have all had a go at busting saunders said she wanted to start a debate that might require some government publicity or government guidance she also expressed concern about the way women were portrayed in the media if a girl goes out and gets drunk and falls over they are almost demonised in the media and if they then become a victim you can see how juries would bring their preconceptions to bear the majority of rape cases are between people who know each other i think that is one of the things that jurors find particularly difficult saunders said judges can give advice and directions during a trial but often this comes too late to make jurors think twice the majority of victims are under a lot have drink or alcohol involved some are repeat victims if she has been a repeat victim do you believe her or is this something about her or about the defendant because we have been concentrating and looking at this we have done a lot of work dispelling our myths and stereotypes but is there something more we should be doing so that when people come onto the jury they are not being challenged for the first time its not something that they have only just thought about there have been a lot of developments about what judges can say to jurors judges cannot do rape cases unless they are specialists and they have been through the mythbusting courses but my view is that sometimes it is possibly too late you may have someone who has already listened to the evidence and may have made up their mind what we need is a wider debate that takes it out of courtroom environment so that people think about it before they get to be a juror she believes opening up the issue will help prosecutions and may even deter offenders who might think they could get away with it saunders believes some women dont complain because they feel they might be vilified they think making a formal complaint might be worse for them in the long run she said we need to encourage people to come forward so it is not something you will be vilified for and jurors when they come to cases they come with a genuinely open mind without any preconceptions saunders is in charge of the biggest cps division in england and wales last year it considered suspected rapes and sent half of them to trial of those just over ended up with convictions the attrition rate those cases that ended in acquittal has been droppingin one recent case saunders said the cps had prosecuted a man three years after the initial complaint was made and they are going through a number of coldcase reviews where new evidence has been found in previously unsolved inquiries saunders led the prosecution team in the case against gary dobson and david norris the two men convicted of the racist murder of stephen lawrence she said that although no new evidence had so far been provided by the police she felt sure that others were involved in the killing when we were looking at the case and making the decision about dobson and norris we didnt just look at them we know that other people were involved if we get more evidence then we will go against someone else if there is enough for a realistic prospect of conviction the cps is issuing all its prosecutors with tablet computers in a bid to drastically reduce the number of files and papers by april this year police in london will be submitting all cases electronically and advocates will use the handheld computers to present their cases prosecutors will have tablets when they are standing up in court and they will present everything from a tablet rather than the piles of files you see now said saunders,2012-01,demonisation young woman contributing failure secure conviction

a nurse who prompted an international search because of fears he could have malaria has been detained under the mental health act for sexually assaulting a waitress the alarm over matthew lloyd was raised in october when he failed to keep a hospital appointment and it was feared he could die without medical treatment for the malaria he was thought to have contracted during a drugs trial at the time of his disappearance lloyd had been arrested for attacking a yearold woman as she walked home in the city two months previously but he had not been charged lloyd who was eventually found in the netherlands and returned to the uk was found guilty of the attack by a jury at southampton crown court on friday he did not contract malaria the court heard that lloyd had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and would require longterm care judge susan evans qc sentenced lloyd to a hospital order and an unlimited restriction order over concerns that he was a danger to the public he was ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life the judge told him your victim was clearly vulnerable she thought she was going to be raped by you you are in a state of complete denial about what you have done and that is of concern to this court because of the nature of the offence and the risk of you committing further offences when set at large i take the view that its necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm to make a restriction order under the order the secretary of state for justice is ultimately responsible for the risk assessment that might lead to the subject being freed during the threeday trial the victim who cannot be named for legal reasons said a smiling stranger grabbed her bottom hard as she walked in southampton city centre she told the jury she pressed her fingers into his windpipe to try to fight him off as he continued to sexually assault her she said the only thing he said was how are you doing she got away but encountered lloyd again later she fended him off and managed to get home both times he was smiling she told the trial which took place last year he enjoyed me being in fear the court heard she called the police the

women taken seriously shock no not a headline from this week but a response to the four women who spoke at the leveson inquiry about how the media portrays us anna van heeswijk from object jacqui hunt equality now heather harvey the rape charity eaves and marai larasi end violence against women made their case with quiet assurance and were listened to with courtesy their evidence shockingly enough was deemed worthy of censorship and could not be shown to the sensitive souls of the inquiry even though the images of women they had gathered came from mainstream papers that any child can buy in any newsagent this is as good as it gets you dont challenge page or they do to you what they did to clare short rebekah brooks of course did not ban page as editor of the sun she embraced it is she one of the women in high positions who do not encourage other women who want to be alone of all her sex its the new usp the sisterhood is fantasy i dont want to burst your bubble but women like men are all different clearly the words feminism equality and womens rights are interpreted differently in different contexts it is certainly possible to make alliances over particular issues and we do its called politics here at the inquiry was one such issue leveson listened as he was told systematically what we have known for years rape abuse violence and the murder of women are often reported in a sensational and titillating way the victims even when they are children are often held somehow to blame pictures of seminaked women whose bodies are up for scrutiny have become our societal screensaver this is but a sideissue for leveson one of many for why did he not discuss sexism with male editors or with richard desmond whose media business is founded on porn another issue beyond levesons remit is that of women as consumers there is not a newspaper or a tv show that is not chasing the female pound right now commercially and politically i can see that pulling away from victimy and drab feminism in favour of being chic and individually entrepreneurial the new fun kind of feminism that cant get enough of men or makeovers works so again up pops louise mensch rebranding feminism in her own image hip uplifting gogetting its all cool except dont mention the cword class or that downer thing victims some women dont see themselves as victims they are victims they are beaten and abused they dont vote and gasp dont have their own small businesses sometimes collective politics means simply looking out for the weakest rather than pushing oneself up to bellow with the strongest the mensch way though is apparently tory feminism ed vaizey one of the good guys who as mensch says has our backs as opposed to our fronts is going to broker a meeting between nadine dorries and influential people in the media lovely if not the teensiest patronising where tory feminism makes possible sense is on this issue of sexualisation for there is a mishmash of freemarket fundamentalism but a coyness around the flaunting of female sexuality even cameron realised that the squeezed middlemumsnethardworking whatevers do not like padded bras for eightyearolds or to see women in fake lesbian poses when buying monster munch this is uncomfortable territory for the tories because if everything is left to a deregulated market then everybody is up for sale this hypersexualised culture is not new but its means of transmission are what initially drove the suffragettes was widespread prostitution and venereal disease this was the price poor women paid to uphold victorian values the early suffrage movement wanted to protect women as well as give them a modicum of power emmeline pankhurst joined the tories herself many years after women had been given the vote but where does this supposed toryfeminism crossover falter right here on the debate over reproductive rights sexuality and the way women are portrayed in the media for much hinges on whether we regulate or let capitalism go about its natural business feminism has been the territory of the left because it recognises nothing will change without challenging the status quo we do not exist outside of this market and the market says if something sells then sell it even if its an image of a child or abuse none of this is to do with whether women such as mensch look great its about a central tenet of almost any strand of feminist thought control over ones own body the context in which all female bodies are now exposed as revealed at leveson is heavily sexualised this is not balanced by images of women in power in control or even in clothes its that simple austerity is stripping us down to very old gender roles despite the efforts of a few vibrant women mps such as mensch

culture minister ed vaizey has criticised the bbc for the lack of women on its flagship radio programme today backing the guardians campaign to bring about change in a house of commons debate he cited research carried out by the guardian which showed that the number of women averaged just of guests and reporters on the show last year mr vaizey said indeed on july one would have to wait from am to am to hear one female contributor alongside the male contributors to that programme just one of the five regular presenters sarah montague is a woman adding that the issue was a cause for concern he has called for a meeting with mark thompson bbc director general to discuss the lack of female representation the guardians womens blog has called for change on the today programme specifically not because its any worse than any other part of the bbc or indeed the media more widely but because of its agendasetting nature it has long been the place for those who want to whisper in the ear of the nation louise mensch the mp for corby who sits on the culture and media select committee said if its routine and normative for the bbcs flagship programme not to include womens voices thats a serious problem she said she wanted to question thompson on the issue its not just one programme its systemic and a problem elsewhere at the bbc thompson was on his way to davos today where the issue of female participation is also on the agenda just of the participants of the annual meeting for the worlds financial and political elite are women in a statement the bbc said women of all ages feature prominently throughout the bbcs schedules on radio and television there is of course always more we can do to improve gender balance and it is an issue we take seriously the spokesman refused to comment specifically on vaizeys comments vaizey appeared at the oxford media convention today talking about the media industry the house of commons debate was called by nadine dorries whose opinions on abortion and sex education have made her a bte noire among feminist groups and tessa munt they accused the bbc of a culture of sexism citing the lack of older female faces and voices on the bbc and

lord justice leveson is charged with looking at the ethics standards and practices of the british media there has been much commentary on the vexed question of privacy versus freedom of the press i gave evidence to the inquiry today arguing that if levesons recommendations are truly to address ethics and standards in our press then they must look at the way our media treats women the end violence against women coalition made a written submission to the inquiry in december in which we took a snapshot of media reporting of violence against women and showed how these stories tended toward blaming victims upheld myths about particular offences for example that rape is always violent and normally committed by a stranger and exoticised some kinds of violence committed against ethnic minority women we cite the facebook murder of hayley jones in september and the way the telegraph reported it as man killed partner after she changed her facebook status it is of course the natural inclination of journalists to hone in on unusual aspects of a case but focusing primarily on a detail like this carries a subtle message that a womans behaviour caused a mans violence against her we cite also the daily mails reporting of a multiple perpetrator rape of two yearold girls as a midnight park orgy this long news report in carried excuses from the six mens defence counsel around the tragic waste of the mens promising football careers because of one mistake we are also concerned about regular reporting of honourbased violence and forced marriage which tends to attribute serious violence against women entirely to culture and religion and especially islam the murder of banaz mahmod was reported in frankly gratuitous detail and in a way that related the attack to her culture while providing minimal context yet although such crimes are perpetrated against women in many different communities in britain the connection is never made i argued at the inquiry that such unbalanced reporting which exoticises violence against women and blames women for the violence committed against them by focusing on a victims behaviour dress or physicality sends powerful messages to all who read it it is likely to discourage some women from coming forward and reporting violence when victims are portrayed in such a negative and culpable light it may also encourage a potential perpetrator that they will get away with the crime because people will not consider it a real offence cumulatively these subtle messages do of course reflect commonly held attitudes but critically they reinforce and encourage them that is not responsible journalism leveson is charged with looking at newsroom culture but who runs our newsrooms and why do they choose to major on some stories and not others why do journalists seek comment from some sources and not others the guardian has an ongoing survey of who makes the news looking at the gender breakdown of uk newsrooms this comes out at roughly with women an even smaller minority among senior editorial staff while newsrooms would not change completely the way that violence against women is reported more womens perspectives would at least change the questions asked at the beginning of the commissioning process we want leveson to make recommendations to seriously strengthen the press complaints commission womens groups have a strong interest in a free press and we do not want to see heavy regulation or inhibition of journalists who investigate violence against women but at the moment women who are mistreated by the press have little comeback and its very difficult to challenge the no doubt unconscious assumptions about women that pervade so many reports we want a mechanism by which groups can bring complaints as well as individuals we want it to be made more independent with equality groups sitting on it in addition to editors the new body should have the power to investigate press conduct such as consistent misogynistic reporting as well as hear complaints we want softer measures too such as better training for journalists on the myths and realities of violence against women the zero tolerance guide is a brilliant place to start freedom including press freedom does not and cannot exist in a vacuum when press freedom is used an excuse to justify the infringements of individual and collective rights when press freedom allows persistent discrimination against women against black and minority ethnic communities and against other marginalised groups then i believe that the press must be held accountable if leveson is to be different from the press its investigating it must ensure that when it pronounces on the public interest it specifically includes womens interests for legal reasons

the conviction earlier this month of gary dobson and david norris for the murder of stephen lawrence has given me a renewed sense of optimism and reminded me that change can happen even if it takes years the strength and determination of the lawrences and their supporters has not only seen shifts in practice within the police force but has ensured justice for a young man achieving that justice even for one young person required monumental movement across an institution that many believed was impenetrable it makes me wonder whether change and justice for other young people and children can be achieved in other areas older children experience a range of risks some are victims of violence in their intimate relationships others are killed or seriously injured by their peers thousands of older girls are at risk of genital mutilation according to home office figures some are forced into marriages or are victims socalled honourbased violence others are sexually exploited many children run away and end up homeless some are addicted to drugs or alcohol or live in households where substance misuse is prevalent the list goes on the children act is clear that a child is a child up to their th birthday and that all children should be protected from harm yet this sound legislation is applied in a practical environment that often fails to identify or respond to risks that older children face and is determined by a range of services and entrenched societal attitudes that communicate conflicting messages about what abuse is and who needs protecting from it a child can consent to be in a sexual relationship from age but cannot be a victim of domestic violence in that relationship until they reach a girl can enter a domestic violence refuge with her mother at any age but many refuges will not take boys with their mothers once those boys reach age in the confusion many services struggle to respond when i used to go and speak to children in schools across the country i wanted to be able to say to them that if they were being abused i knew what the response of services would be they would know how to keep them safe the fact that i couldnt and still cant is unjust last year the munro review into child protection started a process of opening up and challenging child protection practices that may have seemed as impenetrable as the police force once did however improving childrens services alone will not provide solutions for protecting older children they encounter a mosaic of interventions from health criminal justice education and housing agencies to name a few whose responsibility is it to offer protection and what should this protection look like extending services that deal with violence against adult women to include older girls will not provide the safety needed they are not adults likewise childrens services often fail to respond to the different risks faced by older children changing policing practices and achieving justice for stephen lawrence seemed like an impossible dream in policing is not perfect but change has happened whether its tackling gangs and serious youth violence child sexual exploitation or violence in teenage

we were pleased to see your report an abuse of faith social care january outlining the evidence of the numbers of black children subjected to violence linked to witchcraft this is extremely concerning and many of us have worked with such children and adults from the black communities who have experienced abusive aspects of juju santeria witchcraft and possession in the uk while our major religious institutions are now putting safeguarding procedures into place children and adults from smaller religious groups do not have that safety we are also concerned as individuals and as a committee that the ritual abuse of white children and adults is less easily acknowledged the kidwelly case in it can be far easier sometimes for racist reasons to accept the ritual abuse of black children witness the adam case known as torso in the thames in and especially from workingclass backgrounds the white middleclass children and adults and those who work with them and support them are subject to implications that such experiences if the victim is not black must be bizarre delusions this makes it harder for disclosures to be made and for the police to help and delays the understanding of the impact of ritual on all children and adults when used abusively dr v sinason rachel wingfield prof joseph schwartz dr sandra buck dr joan coleman carole mallard wilfred wong deborah briggs dr pat frankish david leevers orit badoukepstein lynn greenwood committee on ritual abuse london,2012-01,pleased see report abuse faith social care january outlining evidence number black child subjected violence linked witchcraft extremely concerning many u worked child adult black community experienced abusive aspect juju santeria witchcraft possession uk major religious institution putting safeguarding procedure place child adult smaller religious group safety also concerned individual committee ritual abuse white child adult less easily acknowledged kidwelly case far easier sometimes racist reason accept ritual abuse black child witness adam case known torso thames especially workingclass background white middleclass child adult work support subject implication experience victim black must bizarre delusion make harder disclosure made police help delay understanding impact ritual child adult used abusively dr v sinason rachel wingfield prof joseph schwartz dr sandra buck dr joan coleman carole mallard wilfred wong deborah briggs dr pat frankish david leevers orit badoukepstein lynn greenwood committee ritual abuse london,"['pleased', 'see', 'report', 'abuse', 'faith', 'social', 'care', 'january', 'outlining', 'evidence', 'number', 'black', 'child', 'subjected', 'violence', 'linked', 'witchcraft', 'extremely', 'concerning', 'many', 'u', 'worked', 'child', 'adult', 'black', 'community', 'experienced', 'abusive', 'aspect', 'juju', 'santeria', 'witchcraft', 'possession', 'uk', 'major', 'religious', 'institution', 'putting', 'safeguarding', 'procedure', 'place', 'child', 'adult', 'smaller', 'religious', 'group', 'safety', 'also', 'concerned', 'individual', 'committee', 'ritual', 'abuse', 'white', 'child', 'adult', 'less', 'easily', 'acknowledged', 'kidwelly', 'case', 'far', 'easier', 'sometimes', 'racist', 'reason', 'accept', 'ritual', 'abuse', 'black', 'child', 'witness', 'adam', 'case', 'known', 'torso', 'thames', 'especially', 'workingclass', 'background', 'white', 'middleclass', 'child', 'adult', 'work', 'support', 'subject', 'implication', 'experience', 'victim', 'black', 'must', 'bizarre', 'delusion', 'make', 'harder', 'disclosure', 'made', 'police', 'help', 'delay', 'understanding', 'impact', 'ritual', 'child', 'adult', 'used', 'abusively', 'dr', 'v', 'sinason', 'rachel', 'wingfield', 'prof', 'joseph', 'schwartz', 'dr', 'sandra', 'buck', 'dr', 'joan', 'coleman', 'carole', 'mallard', 'wilfred', 'wong', 'deborah', 'briggs', 'dr', 'pat', 'frankish', 'david', 'leevers', 'orit', 'badoukepstein', 'lynn', 'greenwood', 'committee', 'ritual', 'abuse', 'london']",16
can you touchtype its a simple question but when i ask around i am struck by how many women say they taught themselves in secret some former grammarschool girls over have even told me that they were told not to learn at all they were supposed to become executives with secretaries the teaching of typing in schools remains haphazard how did we end up with such an odd relationship with the instrument at the heart of most modern jobs and communication especially one that was a tool of female emancipation offering women a respectable line of work in offices the modern typewriters qwerty keyboard was designed by an american james densmore in around laid out to prevent keys jamming and improve flow rate it remains the standard today seeing off its only serious rival the s dvorak which claimed to require even less finger action than the qwerty womens expected accomplishment at piano playing at the time was directly linked to the typewriters finger flow and late thcentury advertising for the first massproduced models featured women demonstrating that even females could operate them with ease historian anna davin has written that when the british civil service took over operating telegraph and postal offices in the s the official in charge frank scudamore sought out women clerks for their typing speed and dexterity but crucially scudamore said the wages which will draw male operators from but an inferior class of the community will draw female operators from a superior class women would spell and type better raise the tone of the office then marry and leave without requiring pensions so the trap of the overeducated but lowstatus secretary was born the bbcs typing pool may have been the entry point for some successful female broadcasters and executives such as natasha kaplinsky but in rona jaffes mad menera novel the best of everything sexual predators prowl its perimeter in the seminal s film working girl the secretaries bemoan their job title i prefer personal assistant but the only way they can get taken seriously is by pretending to be an executive male executives meanwhile were keen not to be seen at a keyboard in the s ibm researchers found them hostile to the secretarial wordprocessor image of pcs the advent of spreadsheet software is thought to be what first made office pcs acceptable to them then as we entered the digital age men were suddenly glued to the keyboard in the mid s british tech entrepreneur ed maklouf arrived at stanford university in silicon valley if i had any residual idea about the supposed femininity of touchtyping he says it disappeared the moment i walked into a room full of coders and saw them all attacking the keys as though they were in battle like generations of women before me i learned to type on a black spiderlike manual machine in a typing school the positions of the letters embedded themselves into my finger muscle memory ready for a lifetime of typing scripts and news copy but for many women before me it was a skill not to express ones own thoughts but to take down and shape those of a male boss the take a letter miss jones culture that dominated office life until the s also shaped a literary culture in which men thought and women took down and gave discipline and structure to their ideas technology entrepreneur elizabeth varley the ceo and cofounder of techhub a community workspace in central london is one woman who didnt see secretarial work as a trap her mother a single parent used to work from home in melbourne australia as a legal secretary i saw it as a

womens underachievement in maths may not be due to their poor selfimage in the subject a new report suggests researcher dr gijsbert stoet at the university of leeds says that the socalled stereotype threat theory which holds that women perform worse than men because they expect to do badly does not stand up to scrutiny earlier research had serious flaws he says with improper use of statistical techniques and methodology clearly those who carried out this research need to review their own competence in maths stoet believes the gender gap may simply be that men and women have different interests from an early age and says the answer to getting more women into maths and engineering is probably a matter of motivation according to last years results even though girls perform as well as boys in their maths gcses of alevels in the subject are taken by boys who achieve of grade as i am an engineer who has worked in the chemical industry for most of my working career when i graduated in the s i assumed we were at the start of a new era for women in science i studied alongside intelligent and motivated women opportunities seemed aplenty inroads had been made but years down the line only of british engineers are women the lowest proportion in europe compared with in sweden so what has happened one of the main problems is that careers in science technology engineering and maths known as stem are not sufficiently promoted in schools with fewer children taking up these subjects at gcse and alevel year in year out we are told that britain has a skills shortage that falling numbers of graduate scientists and engineers are damaging our ability to compete internationally in spite of girls belief in their abilities the general lack of interest among schoolchildren in maths and science subjects together with the underlying social conditioning that still remains that science subjects arent really for girls has led to a doublewhammy effect reducing female entrants even further over the past few years i have been involved in stemnet an organisation dedicated to promoting these careers by getting people who work in jobs from biologists to builders to talk to schoolchildren about what they do its an attempt to debunk the myth that maths and sciences are too difficult or too boring i was amazed to see hundreds of schoolboys and girls at a recent event at the science museum presenting a range of experiments and projects they had prepared i agree with the new study that rather than focusing on the problems of stereotyping we should devote more time to encouraging girls into science and technology they clearly respond but encouraging schoolgirls into university and careers is not all as is typical in most sectors i see a number of female engineers at the entry and midlevels of companies but precious few at the top i have seen too many wellqualified women who fail to make it to top positions due to poor company culture and the lack of flexible working to allow returning mothers to the workplace this is a huge waste of talent the report has done well to challenge the myths behind womens underachievement in schools but more work still needs to be done to address the problem of womens lack of achievement in the workplace follow comment is free on twitter commentisfree,2012-01,womens underachievement math may due poor selfimage subject new

it is not an easy task to make an audience roar with laughter while lecturing on domestic violence and homicide but such was the compelling humour of ellen pence who has died of breast cancer aged pence was a pioneer in creating and promoting innovative strategies to deal with domestic abuse the training she developed and the accessible and motivational way in which she delivered it changed the way violence towards women and children in the home is viewed in she founded the domestic abuse intervention project widely known as the duluth model named after the minnesota city where it was developed based on an interagency approach in which police probation services courts social services and womens advocacy projects work together to assess risk protect victims and deal effectively with the abuser this strategy remains a blueprint across the us and uk the duluth model pioneered the somewhat controversial perpetrator programmes for abusive men which now run in several countries as an alternative to or as part of a custodial sentence for domestic violence offences pence always had a clear understanding that abusive men can change if those working with them have the appropriate training skills and tools she created the programme with the aim of teaching offenders to accept responsibility for their actions and to desire change possibly the most effective training tool in domestic violence is the power and control wheel that pence designed in with her colleagues having listened to the stories of hundreds of victims of domestic abuse over the years it explains the complex set of tactics used by abusers to instil fear and achieve control such as isolation victim blaming using children as a weapon and emotional abuse the wheel is used in training by a multitude of professionals and campaigners worldwide born in minneapolis minnesota pence earned her ba from the college of st scholastica in duluth and a phd from the university of toronto her mother inspired her to be an activist and as a young woman pence became involved in antiwar civil rights and homelessness issues in she joined the feminist movement against domestic violence and five years later she moved to duluth where with a group of friends she came up with the duluth model pence was a regular visitor to the uk speaking at conferences and leading training sessions for police policymakers and refuge workers she had a talent for being challenging and critical without causing offence she disarmed a number of powerful adversaries such as hostile judges and senior police officers with her wit and sharpness of mind she managed to break through what she termed the spectacular machismo of the us marine corps in the s and designed a response to domestic violence among military personnel during the past three decades she published numerous papers and book chapters on institutional responses to the issue of violence against women and coauthored two books education groups for men who batter the duluth model with michael paymar in and coordinating community response to domestic violence lessons from duluth and beyond with melanie shepard in until late pence was the executive director of

o frabjous day callooh callay forgive my enthusiasm but this morning in the last half an hour of the today programme we heard author sue townsend journalist mary ann sieghart and reporter zubeida malik on radio s flagship show and this came after a fourminute report on research into the gender stereotyping of mathematics featuring kate belingham former government careers adviser these four women who made it on to the shows published running order here meant that the percentage of women asked to speak as experts represented nearly of the shows total far better than the daily average there was still a solid hour in which the two male presenters discussed todays papers spying allegations pakistan and the morality of capitalism with other men and it seems as ever that only men have thoughts for the day but still is this a sign that progress is being made when asked about the increase editor ceri thomas wrote in a text this morning i couldnt honestly say that its design rather than accident we havent talked differently about representation this week than we have in any other week in the past few years but if the scrutiny is starting to change things then thats not bad news after kira cochranes research on the lack of women in the media was published in the guardian there seemed little change thomas said he has received just one complaint about the lack of women since which he largely blames on their scarcity in positions of authority rather than any bias but current and former listeners were ready to complain to the guardian and did so in great numbers once kiras piece was published and the guardians womens blog urged readers to discuss the issue and perhaps more importantly keep track of how many women were being asked on to the show here the response not just on comments but via email to womentheguardiancom suggested a shared outrage over the lack of women being heard on a radio show that more than any other sets the news agenda one wrote to today in december to complain about the reports on the cameron eu veto as they only managed to find men to speak for the entire programme no single woman was able to voice an opinion on what this may mean for the future of the ukeu relationship i got a response which made me so cross that i trashed it so sadly no longer have the evidence to share however it basically said that the programme valued competence as the key attribute of contributors and so they had picked the most competent people to speak that morning hence my anger the idea that there wasnt a single woman competent to speak on the ukeu relationship was infuriating some saw the show as simply representative of a bias at the bbc and the media in general for trivialising women rachel overton wrote completely agree re lack of women on radio today programme it seems to be an issue across the bbc i love the bbc but it must do better my young nieces ask me why all the main characters on cbbcbeebies are boys sarah aldridge wrote as a londoner now resident in australia i listen to the bbc podcasts i tried to listen to the today programme but soon gave up too male too dry and now only regularly listen to desert island discs and womans hour both are great and have strong female presenters but also a mix of male and female interviewees as an architect i have worked all my adult life in a very maledominated field so am well used to listening to men but in my experience nobody male or female wants to be surrounded aurally or physically by only one gender congratulations on this muchneeded initiative wrote ellie cumbo im a today fan which is why i cant understand why more isnt done to make sure my perspective which will obviously to some extent depend on my gender is reflected this last raises an issue that annoyed some fans of the show so for the record let me say that the attempt to raise awareness and bring about change is about recognising the value of diversity rather than simply dissing the talent of any individual of course we all have our favourites and want impressive and excellent presenters male or female its just that i and obviously many of you refuse to believe that so many more men than women are good enough as presenters reporters and guests we cant attempt to change the entire ecosystem of the media in one fell swoop but by focusing on today and its behaviour then we can see whether change can come at all so please keep monitoring the programme and tell us when entire showshourstopics are discussed with no input from women please comment below or email womenguardian with your findings some have suggested a twitter hashtag we could use to suggest female alternatives for guests or indeed journalists but before we do that i thought we should continue to keep a record of what is going on if there are any academic institutions out there that fancy doing more detailed research do get in touch im planning to go to davos next year where economic and political leaders are also struggling to include more women but we will as ever keep an eye on this and ill report back on the findings when im back thanks for all your help and interest so far,2012-01,frabjous day callooh

many victims of domestic violence will be unable to obtain legal help in future to help them escape from abusive relationships according to a report by womens groups research conducted by rights of women and welsh womens aid suggests that nearly half of domestic violence victims will not be eligible under cuts in legal aid proposed by the ministry of justice the report is published as the house of lords examines a further section of the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders bill on wednesday afternoon and considers in detail plans to restrict legal aid in family cases to ensure that all women affected by domestic violence are protected it is essential that the evidential criteria used reflects the experiences of women and the reality of domestic violence the report states this must include evidence from specialist domestic violence organisations health services and social services the government has also proposed to apply a month time limit to each of the evidential criteria it would mean that a woman who has had a domestic violence injunction in place could not use the injunction as evidence of violence if it expired more than months ago this simply does not reflect the reality of domestic violence in particular the ongoing risk that perpetrators pose to women and their use of private family law proceedings to get back in contact with a woman who has been safe for some time rights of womens family law advice line often receives calls from women who have been separated and safe from an abusing expartner for some time only to be placed at risk once more when he initiates child contact proceedings the organisation is urging peers to support an amendment backed by lady scotland lady butlersloss the lord bishop of leicester and lord blair that would set up a broader definition of domestic violence like that already used by the uk border agency to decide immigration applications the lords have so far given the bill a largely hostile reception hundreds of amendments have been tabled and prominent conservative and liberal democrat peers have opposed clauses in the bill which is aimed at saving m from the departments annual budget the moj insists it is preserving legal aid for women at risk of violence but has failed to gather support in the lords for its definitions of what constitutes genuine risks another report released on wednesday by the access to justice action group ajag dismisses the claim by the justice secretary kenneth clarke that the uk has become addicted to a compensation culture it says that in the past five years nearly million people have used no win no fee arrangements to hire a solicitor to help them claim compensation but the report concludes that there is no compensation culture to kill ajags coordinator andrew dismore said no win no fee is the only way low and middleincome people can afford to bring a case for compensation the legal aid bill is like robin hood in reverse ordinary people wont be able to afford to bring expensive legal claims the study says most compensation claimants are not welloff and their claims are not excessive the average amount of compensation they get is less than and fewer than of claimants get more than threequarters of those who claim compensation have only ever claimed once and a fifth have claimed twice it says that less than one in every insurance claims are fraudulent and only of people who have ever claimed compensation for anything have done so more than twice in their lives the report concludes that cuts in legal aid and reforms of no win no fee agreements will kill the chances of getting compensation for more than people every year who will lose out on redress for accidents that are no fault of their own and people will lose up to a quarter of their compensation in legal costs the changes in the bill will however save the insurance industry bn a year it suggests,2012-01,many victim domestic violence unable obtain legal help future help

texas is a largely christian state that appears to believe in neither forgiveness nor redemption last week the guardian revealed the extent to which it has criminalised its children police now patrol the schools arresting and charging pupils as young as six for breaches of discipline among the villainies for which they have been apprehended are throwing paper aeroplanes using perfume in class cheeking the teacher wearing the wrong clothes and arriving late for school a yearold boy with attention deficit disorder was imprisoned for turning over a desk six years later hes still inside children convicted of these enormities such tickets were issued by texas police in acquire a criminal record this can make them ineligible for federal aid at university and for much subsequent employment yet most of them have committed no recognised crime as one of the judges who hears their cases explained if any adult did it its not going to be a violation on the other hand no charges have been brought against a texas judge called william adams last year a video was released which showed him beating the living daylights out of his daughter with a leather belt the attack was so savage that when i watched it i nearly threw up adams cannot be prosecuted because the beating took place eight years ago but even if it had happened yesterday he might not have been charged as he could have claimed that he was disciplining his child in both cases the law permits people to do things to children that they could not do to adults but before we start feeling too superior we should remember that systematic injustice towards children is common to many nations consider these cases all from the past few decades the theft of babies and forced adoptions in spain the teenage girls pressed into slavery in irelands magdalene laundries the sexual abuse in its industrial schools similar institutional abuse also by catholic priests in many parts of the world sexual abuse and beatings in welsh childrens homes the british children told wrongly that they were orphans and exported to australia canada and other commonwealth countries the assaults by staff in privately run child jails it seems to me that such abuses have three common characteristics the first is that the countries in which they occur appear to possess a sacrificial caste of children whose rights can be denied and whose interests can be disregarded with impunity the second is that these countries have a powerful resistance towards confronting and addressing this injustice discussing it often amounts to a taboo these two traits were chillingly dramatised in kazuo ishiguros novel never let me go the third is that systematic abuse becomes widely acknowledged only after determined people such as margaret humphreys who campaigned on behalf of the child migrants and alison taylor the welsh care homes spend years trying to force it into the open in the face of official denial so i want to try once more to begin a discussion about an issue we still refuse to examine early boarding it is as british as warm beer green suburbs and pointless foreign wars despite or because of that we wont talk about it those on the right will not defend these children as they will not criticise private schools those on the left wont defend them as they see them as privileged and therefore undeserving of concern but childrens needs are universal they know no such distinctions the uk boarding schools website lists schools which take boarders from the age of eight and which take them from the age of seven i expect such places have improved over the past years they could scarcely have got worse children are likely to have more contact with home though one school i phoned last week told me that some of its pupils still see their parents only in the holidays but the nature of boarding is only one of the forces that can harm these children the other is the fact of boarding in a paper published last year in the british journal of psychotherapy dr joy schaverien identifies a set of symptoms common among early boarders that she calls boarding school syndrome her research suggests that the act of separation regardless of what might follow it can cause profound developmental damage as early rupture with home has a lasting influence on attachment patterns when a child is brought up at home the family adapts to accommodate it growing up involves a constant negotiation between parents and children but an institution cannot rebuild itself around one child instead the child must adapt to the system combined with the sudden and repeated loss of parents siblings pets and toys this causes the child to shut itself off from the need for intimacy this can cause major problems in adulthood depression an inability to talk about or understand emotions the urge to escape from or to destroy intimate relationships these symptoms mostly affect early boarders those who start when they are older are less likely to be harmed it should be obvious that this system could also inflict wider damage a repressed traumatised elite unable to connect emotionally with others is a danger to society look at the men who started the first world war over the past few days i have phoned the education department the boarding schools association and the headteachers of several schools to ask them a simple question how did they decide that seven or eight was an appropriate age for children to start boarding in every case the answer was the same they didnt this they all told me is just the way it has always been done no inquiry no committee no board no ethics council has as far as they know ever examined this question very young children are being sent away from home in a complete vacuum of professional advice compare this with the ethical agonising over whether or not children should be taken into care and you encounter the class prejudice common to all british governments the upper classes require no oversight so yes rage against texas and its monstrosities and wonder at the cruel authoritarian system a nominal democracy can produce but remember that this is not the only place in which governments endorse the damage done to childrena fully referenced version of this article can be found at wwwmonbiotcom,2012-01,texas largely christian state appears believe neither

a series of gang attacks on brothels in east london has triggered calls for changes to the prostitution laws after victims who reported knifepoint robberies said they ended up being threatened with prosecution a police investigation has been launched as senior labour and conservative members of the london assembly and the english collective of prostitutes allege that violent crime is being given a lower priority than less serious sex offences the attacks highlight the growing debate over calls for new zealands pioneering decriminalisation of sex work to be considered an approach recently supported by the association of chief police officers what is said by sex workers to be a spate of robberies involving cash and jewellery coincides with an increase in police raids on east london addresses being used as brothels before the london olympics the first address targeted was in barking east london on december a video showing five men apparently breaking into another house in the area being used by sex workers is also being studied by officers the women who made the first complaint allege they recognise some of the gang members from the youtube clip in a third attack at a different address a woman who worked as a maid at a brothel is alleged to have been raped by the gang none of the victims there reported the offence for fear of being charged by officers with living off the proceeds of prostitution the police say they are so far unaware of this incident the ecp said changes to the law in response to fears over the forcible trafficking of foreign sex workers into britain have made it more difficult for women to work together in houses for safety a letter of complaint sent by niki adams a leading ecp activist who works with legal action for women to the borough police commander in barking last month said the way the investigation into the first incident had been pursued had discouraged sex workers from reporting attacks the letter continued the december attack was at knifepoint and the women felt they had to try and protect themselves they think the assailants may well be the same people who have robbed them before who have got away with it and so have returned and become more violent as they have got bolder targeting women for prosecution in this way undermines any attempts to catch those who attack and exploit sex workers we are receiving reports of incidents where women have been attacked and their attackers have told them brazenly that they know women wont dare go to the police adams believes there may have been as many as attacks in the area over the past two years the metropolitan police confirmed it was aware of the december attack and the youtube video and is investigating whether the attacks are linked we can confirm that we were called to an alleged incident of aggravated burglary at an address in victoria road barking a statement said patrolling officers arrived at the scene and were quickly accompanied by scene of crime officers and detectives from barking and dagenham cid detectives also visited the venue on a further occasion to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the incident unfortunately those at the address were unwilling to substantiate the allegation or further assist with the investigation despite a number of attempts for them to do so the case remains under investigation and should any further information come to light it will of course be vigorously pursued the force said a notice has been served to the registered owner of the venue in victoria road under the auspices of section a of the sexual offences act the notice formally notified the recipient that they were liable to prosecution should the premises in victoria road remain in use as a brothel referring to the youtube video the police said we are looking to see if the attacks are linked officers take any such reports extremely seriously and actively encourage all members of the community particularly those who may be vulnerable to such incidents to come forward and contact police officers at barking and dagenham work hard to ensure that the borough remains a safe place for all residents the welfare of victims remains our primary concern and we acknowledge that some members of the community are more vulnerable and susceptible to crime we strive to encourage and support female victims and to assist us further we are in the process of launching a bespoke multiagency victim care service this will see female victims receiving the best possible support and will include fasttrack referrals to housing and health professionals as well as safer neighbourhood reassurance intervention prostitution itself is not illegal but associated activities such as kerb crawling placing advertising cards in phoneboxes and working in premises with more than one person available for paid sex are outlawed last november simon byrne acpos lead officer on prostitution and sexual exploitation suggested there was a need for a fresh look at the legal balance then deputy chief constable of greater manchester byrne is in the process of moving to the met as assistant commissioner there is a great amount of academic research available much of which supports the view that an alternative approach is needed he wrote on his official acpo blog an example would be the decriminalisation and regulation of brothels in australia and new zealand not an answer to all of the related issues but certainly a solution to some more of those involved in sex work in australia and new zealand can now access health services with ease whilst maintaining more personal security in an emotive area for policing another proponent of reform is andrew boff a conservative member of the london assembly the law is framed so as to put women sex workers into the most vulnerable position he said the changes brought in by the last government seemed to be derived from the view that every single worker in the sex trade was trafficked people are not willing to come forward over these attacks when they report them the women themselves have had action taken against them im compiling a report on the problem for boris johnson len duvall the leader of the labour group at the london assembly said we need to examine in greater detail information and case studies from those countries that have sought to legalise prostitution including the model put forward by new zealand especially if it provides a degree of protection for sex workers and reduces crimes associated with prostitution where brothels have not posed a problem to the wider community and there has been no evidence of sex trafficking i have heard evidence that the police have taken an inconsistent and heavyhanded approach in dealing with sex workers there is also evidence that crimes against sex workers are being ignored earlier this month sheila farmer a sex worker who operated with other women out of shared premises had charges of brothelkeeping against her dismissed at croydon crown court the crown prosecution service said there had been no change in enforcement policy the unexpected failure of a witness to appear led to the charge being withdrawn farmer said she had chosen to work with other women for safety because she had been attacked previously when working alone nigel richardson the solicitor who represented her said he was aware of another case in surrey where women had reported an attack on their flat from a rival operation they were visited by two men who threatened the women and were pouring petrol around the place he said my client called the police officers intially took the attack very seriously but eventually arrested my client the men were never brought to book for an assault but my client was prosecuted for running a brothel tim barnett the britishborn former new zealand mp who pushed through his adopted countrys decriminalisation legislation in was in london before christmas where he briefed boff and duvall we said lets make the law the best to minimise harm he said at the time we set up a review of the legislation a number of people said the number of sex workers would rise so we reviewed it after five years in the review didnt find any increase and there was an improvement in the relationship with the police sex workers were using their rights under the legislation to deal with poorquality brothel owners or clients who had been behaving abusively,2012-01,series gang attack brothel east london ha triggered call change prostitution law victim reported knifepoint robbery

the woman in the photograph is smiling a fixed redlipsticked smile that doesnt quite reach her eyes snapped against a wall she wears a black tshirt with the words this is what a feminist looks like in defiant white letters across her chest she was part of a campaign four years ago to challenge assumptions about feminism and she encapsulates both why it was needed and how fast things can change for the model is theresa may and as her expression suggests at the time this was a decidedly risky stunt for her until very recently the f word was rarely heard in tory circles even as late as the last election campaign the media barrister and unsuccessful parliamentary candidate joanne cash recalls a glossy magazine shoot for aspiring mps where several of her colleagues balked at being labelled with it as louise mensch the conservative mp for corby and a selfprofessed feminist since her teens says its easy to get up there and be the reverse of spartacus no im really not spartacus shes over there its like room take the other guy well not any more may is not only in cabinet now but serves as unofficial patron to a formidable phalanx of women backbenchers among whom feminism is almost in vogue in the words of anastasia de waal deputy director of the rightwing thinktank civitas i think that most of the women who came in with me in would describe themselves as feminists says amber rudd mp for hastings and rye they have thought it through they know why theyre here its a far cry from margaret thatchers bald declaration that i owe nothing to womens lib for veterans of the womens movement there may be something unnerving about hearing the familiar slogans from tory mouths a sense that as a female columnist lamented recently of mensch these late converts are the wrong kind of feminists they certainly raise difficult questions about whether one can really be a feminist and promarriage or antiabortion or hawkish on a deficit reduction from which women in particular are suffering but the distinct phenomenon of tory feminism has too much potential influence over ordinary womens lives to be summarily dismissed why has there been so little serious effort to pin down this new creed from the dagenham workers equal pay strike to the greenham common peace camps the pedigree of modern feminism is closely entwined with that of the left but jump back a couple of generations and its a different story just over a century ago it was labour that rebuffed the suffragette emmeline pankhursts membership application because she was a woman she later stood for parliament as a conservative instead trade unions of the time meanwhile championed the case for a family wage for men with wives staying at home theres nothing inherently leftwing or rightwing about feminism as we would define it its about women having equal power and influence over the course of their lives says anna bird acting chief executive of the pressure group the fawcett society which organised the tshirt campaign but there is a question about priorities women in opposite parties may pursue similar ends but by very different means one yearold civil servant started a blog feminism for tories run anonymously because her job requires political neutrality after feeling like an outsider in conventional womens groups im normally the most rightwing person in the room and i wondered why that was she says what she sees emerging at westminster is a mix of free market feminism the belief that with the bare minimum of rules to ensure free competition men and women will naturally find their own balance and what she calls a pragmatic lets just see what has an effect without creating a backlash approach in a nutshell its these two ideas a flat refusal to see women as victims needing systematic protection and a desire not to alienate men that distinguish british rightwing feminism from its leftwing sister what distinguishes it in turn from the suspiciously flimsy girl power rhetoric embraced by sarah palin in the us is its deep historical roots a conservative strand of feminism can be traced at least as far back as the th century writer mary astell who argued almost a century before mary wollstonecrafts call to arms a vindication of the rights of women for female education as a means of empowerment describing marriage as too often a trap for wives since women felt they had little choice but to jump at any husband astell argued in her essay some reflections upon marriage that education would ensure women were guided by reason not only in choosing a mate but in deciding whether to marry at all but what distinguishes astell from the enlightenment feminists who followed is an emphasis on individual women empowering themselves through education or religious faith rather than mass social change its not about exploding the nuclear family but shifting power within it fastforward three centuries and tory feminists still carefully endorse their leaders proposed tax break for married couples where one is a stayathome parent which for anna bird is a knowing attack on women a knowing incentive for a certain kind of family structure but their prevailing view of family life bears little resemblance to the traditional rights sstyle nostalgia louise mensch who is divorced and remarried says that for couples who can stay together marriage or an equivalent situation is an ideal way to bring children up but asked what she means by equivalent she cites civil partnerships and even a truly committed nonmarried partnership i know one couple that have remained unmarried for years it doesnt have to be traditional marriage anyway its not marriage she thinks is problematic for feminists but economic inequality and the way earning power affects relationships i think most people on the left are not opposed to marriage and happy relationships theyre opposed to what they perceive as the historical imbalance of power in relationships in which the man does whatever he wants and the woman is economically dependent and tied to the man which i think is another reason for looking at how women earn more money as for her muchquoted remarks last year about dressing up to please ones husband mensch says she was misquoted what i said is its nice if partners make an effort for each other but it suits a leftwing agenda to say i said a woman should make herself look pretty for a man with no reciprocity indeed for rightwing feminists the right not to be a sex object and not to be judged on ones looks is key claire perry the devizes mp and a ministerial aide to the defence secretary philip hammond recently tried unsuccessfully to persuade female colleagues to stop dyeing their hair for a month letting their grey roots show in a statement of defiance against the pressure on women to look artificially young you could have a whole house full of women with a badger stripe you could raise money for ovarian cancer or something and say this is what looks like she says wistfully the new conservative women are also much more prepared to have the fight with business over issues like inappropriately sexy clothes for young girls according to katherine rake director of the parenting charity the family and parenting institute but then in the curious venn diagram of the new politics sex is where traditional rightwing thinking with its emphasis on public decency and radical feminism overlap ever since clare shorts valiant but doomed battle to ban topless women from the sun it has been conventional political wisdom that page three was essentially untouchable yet the new tory women are surprisingly fearless on the subject one of my fellow mps said to me what do you think about page three what are we going to do about that says amber rudd the whole issue of porn and sexuality thats where feminism meets conservatism claire perry who last year led a campaign for internet service providers to filter out porn unless customers specifically request it also recently met a pressure group opposed to page three i find it so distasteful now just women with their tits out she cries i hate even more this ridiculous little heres kelly wondering about britains position in the euro bubble they are obviously made out to look stupid taking on millions of sun readers isnt easy she concedes but its an issue that we should have a think about where things get stickier for tory feminists however is on the bigger questions of sovereignty over a womans body the conservative backbencher nadine dorriess emotive bid last summer to strip abortion providers of their role in counselling women left many voters with the clear impression of a party hostile to the right to choose voting records however suggest things are less clearcut more than twothirds of female conservative mps who voted sided with the prochoice camp against dorries even mensch who is prolife didnt support her amendment because she believes abortion clinics operate in good faith and whatever their individual positions there is a palpable reluctance among the new intake to let dorriess campaign become their defining image amber rudd who is prochoice is now studying ways to reduce unwanted teenage pregnancies precisely because i dont want to have the abortion debate again i just dont think the house of commons has any business debating womens bodies any more what tory women would far rather debate is work for its here that feminism fuses very comfortably with the legacy of that trickiest icon of female power margaret thatcher thatcher casts a long shadow over conservative women having managed to make it both easier and harder for them to rise to the top the importance of proving that women can lead cannot be overstated but her success became a stick with which to beat her successors a convenient excuse not to tackle blatant sexism in the selection process on the grounds that if she could get through surely others could it wasnt until david cameron introduced the alist selection process effectively bumping female and ethnic minority candidates up the list that this spell was broken the biggest problem with thatcher as a feminist icon however is that she seems to have regarded the movement as irrelevant at best and suspiciously socialist at worst the cautionary lesson the grocers daughter drew from her own life was not about gender but class creating a fierce but genderneutral belief in the importance of being able to haul oneself up by ones bootstraps three decades later her echo is most clearly heard in the new generations positively evangelical enthusiasm for liberating women through entrepreneurship perry a mother of three who started her own financial advice company wants to see childcare made taxdeductible for anyone starting a business to send a really strong signal backing entrepreneurship especially as a way back from redundancy or a career break the idea of building something starting it from scratch is a very tory thing she says one of the best ways to get off benefits is not to be a victim to start something mensch who describes selfmade women as the essence of feminism so long as they dont deny similar opportunities to others wants women to be encouraged to chase money rather than career satisfaction at work since thats where she believes power lies a feminism that stigmatises the profit motive stigmatises womens ability to get on and break the glass ceiling its this emphasis on freeing women to work together with a characteristic desire to make men part of the solution which arguably sees tory feminists at their boldest all three parties now support scandinavianstyle transferable maternity leave under which a new mother could be allowed to split her time off with her partner so that each spent some months at home with the baby but it was may who embraced the shared parenting idea before her labour counterparts arguing that employers might discriminate less against mothers if it wasnt just women taking time off with a baby as katherine rake points out on some issues it may be actually easier for a toryled administration to take on their old allies in business than for labour its like labour taking on the nhs it knows it can count on their support longterm and while employers are now lobbying to get the shared parenting proposals shelved for many of the new women mps its a crucial step and perhaps never more symbolically important than when there is so little other good news for working mothers the glaring gap in rightwing feminism of course is in what it offers poor and lowskilled women bold and imaginative when it comes to getting more highflyers into boardrooms it has rather less to say to women clinging to humbler jobs by their fingernails whose childcare subsidy under the working tax credit is being cut perhaps thats why tory support has risen among professional women since the election but plummeted among the squeezed middle katherine rake worries that the coalition hasnt grasped the very crunchy reality of modern parenthood for lowpaid parents working alternate shifts and passing the kids between them in the factory car park and while starting your own business may well be liberating for those with marketable skills and bags of confidence how realistic is it for the average female librarian made redundant under spending cuts the flipside of not wanting to see women as victims is a certain blindness to structural causes of disadvantage as the civil servant blogger says tory feminists can have difficulty recognising the collective nature of discrimination and nowhere is that more obvious than in the bitter battle over spending cuts the expectation that female politicians will always champion fellow women is perhaps unfair an extra moral burden not asked of men but if they really believe as mensch puts it that a feminist is a woman who goes out there achieves things and makes things easier for other women some may wonder why tory mps arent now manning barricades outside the treasury its not for lack of nerve compared with the intake of labour women at the same stage they seem bolder and bolshier less fussed about promotion within days of being elected several of the new intake were on the warpath against their governments plans to render rape defendants anonymous and a handful are now serial rebels as joanne cash says this is a different generation raised to assert themselves the generation before had to be more cautious because they might have been stymied i think we owe a lot to labour women for the way they held senior posts did the job and for some power itself seems to have been a radicalising experience amber rudd never went into politics expecting to focus on womens issues but as she puts it somebody has to and sure as eggs are eggs the men arent going to i have been surprised there is such a live battle going on yet on the biggest issue in contemporary politics female guns are mostly silent for some on the right even asking how a feminist could support cutting womens jobs and services betrays leftwing bias charlotte vere campaigns for gender equality through the centreright thinktank she founded women on but wont call herself a feminist partly because she thinks the word has been hijacked by the opposition the people who claim to be feminists now are very leftwing they are anticuts in any shape or form she says a more common complaint is that efforts to shield poorer women from cuts exempting lowpaid public sector workers from pay freezes and extra pension contributions or offering free nursery places for some twoyearolds go ignored they talk about the money we are taking away they never talk about the effort we are putting in on the other side says rudd bird however says the fawcett society considered these elements when analysing how austerity affects women and they dont compensate for the cuts but their main defence is ideological if you believe slashing back the state is the only road to prosperity the greater cost to women who depend more heavily on the state for benefits and jobs becomes a sad but unavoidable consequence of doing the right thing the money for everything for social programmes depends on a sound economy says mensch women are not somehow a special species that exists in a bubble supported by the rest of the economy a vigorous defence of austerity in principle however doesnt preclude discreet intervention in its practice when it comes to the nittygritty tory women arent always quite so relaxed deborah dunleavy has some idea of how it feels to lose your livelihood overnight having sold her stake in her own business to go for a seat that she didnt win as cofounder of the peel policy forum a new rightwing thinktank based in the northwest she is now exploring ideas for a new conservative feminist agenda she too rejects the charge of cuts unfairly punishing women pointing out that nobody stopped to say we have to protect the men when male unemployment outstripped female at the beginning of the banking crisis but then she adds it should be about protecting the workforce if its going to affect women more than the men how can we ease that a little bit and thats where the conservative womens forum comes in the backbench grouping created as a critical friend for downing street marks the beginning of female tory mps organising among themselves together with a new special adviser on womens issues inside no another idea from female mps the plan is to scrutinise every policy understand if theres a gender issue and if there is we need to know about it says perry its a tacit acceptance that the coalition must not cause unnecessary hardship by swinging the axe without understanding the consequences but with its own research function the forum could eventually become an incubator for more femalefriendly ideas and a powerbase for promoting them perry for example is currently hatching plans to replace a womens prison with community programmes funded on a paymentbyresults basis to reduce the number of women locked up for minor offences theres no shortage of new ideas fizzing around tory women the question is whether they have time to make something of them for if austerity fails to bring recovery and their female constituents endure lengthy pain for no gain the tory feminist resurgence may be over brutally quickly several leading lights of the new intake hold marginal seats vulnerable to any backlash at the next election and as time goes on some may feel

natasha walter writer and campaigner thirteen years ago in the new feminism i wrote lets start with margaret thatcher no british woman this century can come close to her achievements in grasping power someone of the wrong sex and the wrong class broke through what looked like invincible barriers to reach into the heart of the establishment women who complain that margaret thatcher was not a feminist because she didnt help other women or openly acknowledge her debt to feminism have a point but they are also missing something vital she normalised female success she showed that although female power and masculine power may have different languages different metaphors different gestures different traditions different ways of being glamorous or nasty they are equally strong equally valid no one can ever question whether women are capable of singleminded vigour of efficient leadership after margeret thatcher she is the great unsung heroine of british feminism nothing i have ever written before or since has brought so much fury on my head it was unacceptable then as it seems to be now for feminists to do anything but denounce thatcher obviously thatcher was no feminist she had no interest in social equality she knew nothing of female solidarity i knew that then as i know it now by the time i left school i was a veteran of protests that resounded to the chant of maggie maggie maggie out out out we should never forget her destructive policies or sanitise her corrosive legacy but nor should we deny the fact that as the outsider who pushed her way inside as the woman in a mans world she was a towering rebuke to those who believe women are unsuited to the pursuit and enjoyment of power girls who grew up when she was running the country were able to imagine leadership as a female quality in a way that girls today struggle to do and for that reason she is still a figure that feminists would be unwise to dismiss tacita dean artist margaret thatcher dominated my school and student years and had a big impact on my political coming of age but not in the way she would have welcomed i know she is being ennobled now by the gentle gaze of history and hollywood but i remember loathing her at the time and feeling no solidarity with her achievements as a woman i was an active student feminist and if anything she was our antifeminist icon everything we didnt aspire to she was a reactionary who cared little for equality of any sort and who had a contemptuous indifference to the arts linda grant author margaret thatcher became leader of the conservative party at the height of the womens movement yet she was completely apart from our campaigns our passions and our identity she was the middleaged woman with the hats the pearls the teeth the strangled highpitched voice and the policies which had nothing to do with equal pay for work of equal value free abortion on demand or take back the night marches her freedom to run for office depended on the traditional accoutrements of a wealthy husband and getting the work of having two children out of the way in one pregnancy thatchers premiership was a wrong contradictory note for feminism we regarded her as a man dressed up in a skirt suit or a woman who used the traditional weapons of sex and flirting to get what and where she wanted perhaps she was ahead of her time and it needed camille paglia to understand her she was one in a long line of powerful femme fatales like the borgias or certain wives of roman emperors who fused power with sex madonna in downing street but more prosaically as much as feminists hated her because she had no solidarity with us or with women for that matter she was sui generis for herself and of herself there is no question that she was a role model in the same way that after obama it could no longer be said that america was so racist it would never elect a black president thatcher in downing street sent out a straightforward message to women that anything was possible the problem remains though that she was so completely unusual that no woman politician since has been remotely like her i cant think of anyone who like thatcher is twice the man and twice the woman of any other mpif she was representative of anyone it wasnt women but a group emerging in the early s who rejected class solidarity knowing their place and aspired instead to home ownership foreign holidays private education selfemployment and there were many women among them she did a great deal to smash the ideas of class that prevailed in the s but smash patriarchy no mary beard classics professor cambridge well she wasnt a feminist nor will she ever be a feminist icon in my sense of the word but we cant deny that having our first woman prime minister was a major symbolic leap forward and its salutary for those of us on the left to be reminded that positive social change does sometime come from the right laura sandys conservative mp for south thanet mrs thatcher is a much more of an icon as a matriarch than as a feminist campaigner her political power was never expressed in terms of battling against the male establishment but as a political personality who dominated the masculine clubby power structures that she inherited once at the helm her status as the matriarch could never be questioned that kept her very safe safe until the children were no longer interested in doing what mother says i dont think that she had time to consider intellectual feminism but she did and still does represent an interesting trait of female activism that we are living with today her political language was focused on women owning your own home setting the household budget choosing the best school for your child these messages were framed and delivered by a woman to encourage other women to take the choices that they needed to take for their families women were given a new level of political importance and one that has not been lost by subsequent leaders so a feminist matriarch but not a feminist icon bidisha author margaret thatcher is no icon of feminism freedom fairness or fashion she is unique in british history as a pioneering woman prime minister she has charisma she has the courage of her convictions she is a survivor which most politicians are not but she aint no sister she likes what macho sexist patriarchal men have always liked war the defence of the status quo established power entrenched inequality heavily rigged individualist competition and absolute freedom not freedom as in emancipation but the greedy savagery of an unregulated market in which man eats man and woman is neither seen nor heard thatcher was a manworshipper who couldnt bear the stink of even one woman poisoning her cabinet she has never said or done anything to help other women she did nothing actively to change the cultural misogyny of british politics as evidenced by our present virtually allmale womanbashing government and by the way women in public life are mocked patronised marginalised drastically underrepresented and subjected to severe double standards both within politics and by the media a feminist icon is womanpositive and womanidentified she openly fights machismo and misogyny on rape domestic violence childcare benefits for single mothers discrimination sexual harassment and sexual inequality thatcher did nothingher stiff serge tailoring boxy croc handbags patent court shoes pussycat bow blouses and set hair have been fetishised by a moronic apolitical fashion industry but feminist iconhood has nothing to do with looks because it is sexist to rate women by our appearance rather than our words and actions as we are not objects that said thatcher was no worse than many of the men before her or since or now it disturbs me that she is held up and bashed with especial hatred base insults and grotesque mockery while male public figures far more loathsome are treated more respectfully thatchers political legacy has been used as an excuse to justify the misogynist backlash against female leadership ami sedghi journalist championed during the s as the original spice girl by the eponymous girl band the iron lady has been depicted as a strong female icon for my generation im i confess that my knowledge of her politics gleaned from disapproving parental murmurs snatched comments and television dramas is limited but for me thatcher is remembered predominantly as the first female to become prime minister hannah pool writer time may be a great healer but the idea of thatcher as a feminist icon is as laughable as it is insulting to all those other great women who have fought tirelessly for equal rights even if we forget all the hideous things she did the miners the crushing of the unions her stance against south african sanctions that the woman who reportedly claimed she owed nothing to the womens liberation movement is now being restyled as a feminist shows how little people understand what feminism is about the overriding principle of feminism is equality and those with power helping raise the bar for those without this is the exact opposite of thatchers me me me conservatism michele hanson columnist she rose to the top despite being a woman so that was an achievement of sorts but thatcher set feminism back by setting such a bad example of a woman in power shes up there with designer vaginas and the pussycat dolls a cynical bastardisation of what the real fight for womens equality is about what an odd woman margaret thatcher was she blubbed over her beloved dead father but barely mentioned her mother she adored her son but didnt seem to care much for her daughter and where were the women in her cabinet only one managed to get in briefly margaret seemed to prefer men especially handsome ones like cecil parkinson or others with whom she could flirt vaguely or boss about because she couldnt have positive discrimination could she she wanted women in on merit but dont tell me she couldnt find any women up to the job there are several dozen in my immediate neighbourhood what a deeply irritating person she was says my friend rosemary forever running home early to cook dinner for dennis did you see her in her pinny at the sink yes we all did thatcher made sure of that icon do me a favour she could have been the grocers daughter who fought her way up to the top job but what did she do to help other less fortunate women when she got up there even on the way up shed taken their kiddies milk away then she took away much of their affordable housing by egging everyone on to buy council houses she privatised the utilities and up went the household bills and she crushed the unions the miners wives didnt have much to thank her for and just to show that women can do anything men can do she started a war rode around on a tank in her headscarf created loads more widows thought herself terrifically grand and used the royal plural for her very own what a wasted opportunity from the great heights she looked down and thought not how can i raise up other women but only how can i poop on the poorer ones all she had really done was turn herself into a joke version of a pigheaded man feminist icon no,2012-01,natasha walter writer campaigner thirteen year ago new feminism wrote let start margaret thatcher british

in an open letter sent to editors and publishers this week hundreds of female journalists in germany called for a quota to ensure that at least of executive positions are filled by women i was one of the signatories of the letter you might think that newspapers dont need quotas for female journalists especially a leftist alternative publication such as taz the berlinbased daily i work for you might think that it should be fairly selfevident that men and women are treated equally at an outlet that has been actively feminist from its early days youd be wrong though its often precisely in institutions and companies with seemingly level playing fields that men are able to settle in all the key positions the less hierarchy and formal structure the more open space for big egos and even today that tends to be men with strong social networks and not women who often prefer to centre debates around subjects rather than themselves and their own interests at my newspaper it took a strike by female employees to force through a quota that was years ago today few of the people in our office would doubt that this solution works out well for everyone it helps women because it guarantees that their perspective their expectations and individual problems are given due consideration and its a plus for most of the men too that the work culture of our newspaper is now shaped by both sexes even more introvert men now get a word in i dont deny that the quota sometimes forces me as editor to take some time to search for the right female candidate for a post when there might be more obvious male contenders it can be exhausting to work on female colleagues to encourage and build them up until they have enough selfbelief to take the next step on the career ladder especially when it comes to leading positions in a newspaper men are often quicker to put their hand up and say yes i will and yes i can in that sense a quota is even important for a feminist like me i hope it wont take another strike to boost the embarrassingly small number of female bosses in german media companies my cosignatories and i hope that our open letter has been a wakeup call that will encourage our colleagues to rethink their entrenched positions and if we have the courage to change things perhaps other countries including britain will be inspired to introduce a female quota too follow comment

the joint report by the inspectorates of police and crown prosecutors on rape cases review of rape cases finds police failings february is yet another damning criticism of police for failing to effectively investigate violent crimes against women and girls and another example of the need to acknowledge the potential links between sexual harassment and rape worryingly it seems that acts of inappropriate touching are deemed too insignificant for police to take seriously as crimes which reveals a mindset that fails to join the dots on differing escalating forms of sexual attacks on women and girls this failure comes within the wider context of government policies which consistently impact negatively on women more than men coupled with continual victim blaming and the dismissal or no criming of serious assaults on women and girls its hard not to wonder if institutional sexism is the underlying problem here and one that needs to be resolved fast if we are to tackle the scourge of sexual violence against women once and for all vivienne hayes chief executive womens resource centre a lot of focus has been put on the negative side of the police in dealing with rape which does not

intelligence failings mean that police are missing evidence of serial rapists according to an official review of rape investigations a joint report by the inspectorates of police and crown prosecutors published on tuesday says that rape problem profiles tracking all attacks in a particular area are only being kept up to date in three out of police forces making it difficult to draw connections between attacks it says every rape by a stranger should be assumed to be part of a pattern of serial offending from the outset it also warns that police investigators are not fully exploiting other sources of information such as dna samples national intelligence material on serious sex offences and the overseas records of foreign nationals in order to build strong prosecution cases the study discloses that reported rape offences were officially logged as no crimes in in england and wales nearly of all recorded rape cases it also shows there is still a wide variation in no crime rates between police forces from in kent to in gloucestershire the inspectorates say that a rape that has been reported and then recorded as a crime should only be nocrimed if the victim states that it did not happen and even then further verifiable information is needed to support this because our experience shows that victims may withdraw allegations because they cannot face the criminal justice process the report does not however specify what proportion of no crime decisions were incorrect the review of rape investigations by her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and the crown prosecution service follows highprofile cases such as the night stalker delroy grant who raped and assaulted elderly victims over a year period in london kent and surrey the report says that the criminal justice system has made progress in the way it meets the needs of rape victims but that urgent improvements are needed in the way police gather and analyse intelligence material if rapists are to be identified and prosecuted the number of rapes recorded by the police has risen by over the past three years more than a quarter with police and prosecutors saying the increase is due to victims having more confidence that their cases will be dealt with sensitively and professionally the inspectorates say they found evidence to support this claim of the improved treatment of victims but they say that the quality of investigations and prosecutions has not kept pace with that improvement the report found examples of good detective work but overall intelligence was not managed in a systematic way examples were potential links between sex attacks that had repeatedly occurred in the same general location on the same day of the week were identified by detectives talking to each other rather than by careful analysis one series of offences which started with inappropriate touching of women in the street progressed towards attempted rape the offences were investigated by different officers and were only pulled together when a detective spotted the connection the report says that every force needs to keep up to date rape problem profiles and should consider initially that every stranger rape to be part of a pattern of serial offending so that the wider links to other crimes are considered dru sharpling of her majestys inspectorate of constabulary said whilst the service for victims is getting better there is absolutely no room for complacency and good intelligence the right investigative approach and targeting resources effectively are key to preventing rape

thousands of children in the uk are being sexually exploited according to the childrens minister tim loughton he told a conference in manchester organised by st marys sexual assault referral centre that many local areas were failing to collate information on the extent of the problem in their communities my strong sense is that this country is waking up to the fact young people are being sexually exploited not in the dozens or the hundreds but very probably the thousands loughton added for too long child sexual exploitation has been a hidden issue he said the government was absolutely committed to reducing the number of young people who fall victim to abuse and was working closely with the sector to make progress with its action plan to tackle child sexual exploitation loughton admitted progress was slow but sure and there is always room and reason for improvement he said the government was going to continue to help organisations such as st marys with funding already committed to support independent sexual violence adviser posts over the next four years he said the government was working with police child protection services judges and magistrates to ensure young witnesses and victims were fully supported through the legal process and we are working hard to increase the use of special measures in courts so we can ease the stress and anxiety of criminal proceedings on young people he added children must be able to make informed choices they must be able to recognise and manage risk and they must have the awareness to make safe decisions this is why sex and relationship education is a key constituent of the wider personal social health and economic education review we are undertaking loughton urged every local safeguarding children board not just some to treat exploitation as a top priority he stressed this was not a race issue and there were examples of child exploitation cases in a range of communities ann marie carrie chief executive of barnardos said child exploitation did not fit one model of behaviour or victim in a way the media has been guilty of promoting only one model when there have been many she said my concern is that the level of awareness about child sex exploitation is akin to domestic violence years ago theres a sense that because the child is over years old that behaviourally and attitudinally there must have been consent but it is abuse and they are still a child and cannot consent she said children can become vulnerable as they move to secondary school away from their friends with predatory perpetrators targeting children who are vulnerable and isolated they drive a wedge between children and their parents and youth workers and they isolate them to command and control them she said its not just about sex its about control in one case said carrie police were called to a flat where a yearold girl was found drunk with eight older men the police released the men and the girl was charged with being drunk and disorderly no one questioned why such a young girl was paralytic with a group of older men carrie said the average age of victims had fallen from to because yearold girls were too sophisticated to be taken in by perpetrators but we work with girls and boys as young as she added prosecutions are woefully inadequate in one case there was a girl who was crossexamined by eight or different qcs after suffering a threeandahalf year period of abuse dr catherine white clinical director at the st marys centre said victims of sexual exploitation tend to be the voiceless marginalised

rugby fans heading through londons waterloo station on their way to the england versus wales game at twickenham yesterday were the target of the first major advertising campaign by a male rape charity the charitys poster has already caused controversy after appearing in london underground stations last week to coincide with the six nations tournament featuring a rugby ball pierced by a nail and the message real men get raped and talking about it takes real strength the adverts will also feature on electronic billboards in march when england play their final home match against ireland michael may of survivors uk a charity that runs a helpline and counselling service for adult gay or heterosexual men who have experienced rape said the campaign was a response to new metropolitan police figures which reveal that on average in london a man is the victim of a sexual crime every hour the government estimates that of male victims report being attacked therefore may believes the assaults recorded by the met in suggest a true figure closer to in the capital the alphamale imagery of rugby is clearly suited to challenging the assumptions about male rape may said a victim is just as likely to be a rugby player as a city banker or a gang member and we hope that by challenging our innate assumptions about the identity of male victims we can make it even fractionally easier for a male rape victim to ask for help the posters are proving a bit controversial but we need to get more men coming forward with their experiences and lose the taboos that hold them back from seeking help professor kim etherington a fellow of the british association for counselling and psychotherapy said men faced deeprooted fears about reporting a sexual attack or admitting they had been raped males are taught from a very early age that they should be strong and in charge to be successfully masculine is to be sexually potent competitive with other males in sexual matters and dominant with sexual interactions being raped challenges and negates all these preconceptions a review of malevictim sexual assaults led the home office to put aside a small pot of money to help victims a report last year by baroness stern acknowledged that the vast majority of male victims of sexual violence do not report it because of the view that men should be able to fight off an attacker the review recognised that men do not come forward for fear of being ridiculed or disbelieved or for fear they may be seen as gay or because they do not wish to be regarded as less of a man the survivors uk helpline is on pmpm on mondays

gangs of young men rape girls they also sometimes act as pimps that seduce a girl then subject her to gang rape or otherwise insist that she sexually service gang members some girls are so desperate for acceptance and so convinced by sexual abuse that they have no other value they see this as inevitable thanks to the testimony of a brave female former member of a london gang in peckham guardian readers learned these terrible truths certainly london is not alone in this phenomenon but as long as we focus only on the victims we will never end this victimisation think about it in a report on antisemitism or racism most of the focus is on the antisemites or the racists so why not on the sexists who victimise girls and women we fear this is because we accept such behaviour as inevitable almost as much as those girls do as if boys will be boys and that is a libel on men in fact the average man is not a rapist in the us and probably in your country too one in five women has been sexually assaulted in her lifetime but the average rapist has attacked times the use of sexualised violence on the streets of britain or america is the result of the cult of masculinity some men become addicted to it and feel they have no identity without it this cult is a drug pushed by gangs and the culture of wars in order to make men act violently and risk their lives against their own selfinterest as human beings thats why what happens with gangs on the streets of your cities and ours most resembles what happens in wartime sociologically psychologically and practically the gangs of london and new york may be different in degree but not in kind we can only uncover and cure this wound to humanity especially to the female half of humanity whose control and subjugation is the most basic requirement of the cult of masculinity if we report on and pay attention to the victimiser not just the victim for example in both city streets and war zones men are far more likely to rape in groups they feel they must uphold the cult of masculinity in the eyes of other men as one soldier in democratic republic of congo reported to swedish researchers you feel you have to do something bad you mix it all sabotage women stealing rip the clothes off killing military officers sometimes order men to rape as proof of loyalty and shared culpability many militiamen in the thick forests of congo tell researchers that they rape even when they dont want to the consequences of not committing sexualised violence they say would be a severe beating by their superiors it is a chain of control held together by steely links of pain soldiers sometimes express regret and say they wouldnt have raped without group pressure as some said after carrying out atrocities in bosnia also group hatred in war means humiliating enemies by raping their women implanting sperm taking over their means of reproduction wiping out the enemy race or ethnicity cultures that put all honour in the purity of their women and keep women weak are actually setting them up as targets an insistence on purity is just the other side of the coin of insisting on sexually servicing other men in both cases the body of a woman exists in the battlefield of male control in places like darfur or guatemala women struggle to maintain any traditional hold on power they may have once had once raped they are stigmatised or shunned by their own families and villages called whores and sluts husbands shun them and police and judges can rerape them many live in silence with their pain telling at most one person close to them or a doctor what theyve endured in the war in bangladesh women said they stayed with the soldiers whod hurt them because they had no choice having been rejected by bangladeshi men neither in war zones nor in street gangs is rape primarily about sex it is sexualised violence whose motive is power control and proving a false image of manhood none of this will ever change unless we focus on creating a culture in which there is no cult of masculinity and no cult of femininity that excuses or even supports it human beings have the full circle of human qualities within ourselves yet males are made to feel ashamed of those that are wrongly called feminine its a truism that the woman a man most fears is the woman within himself but boys who are raised in nonviolent environments that foster empathy dont grow up to fuse sex with violence or become rapists indeed many males cannot function sexually at all when faced with the pain and subjugation of another human thats why so many gang rapes including those under pressure in war zones do not involve sex at all but the use of guns and objects to penetrate female bodies men have a special responsibility to provide models of manhood that are fully human and to raise children in families and societies with equality and without sexualised violence indeed sex and violence are two words that need never go together the truth

the childrens charter abolished the death penalty for children under the age of since then the states worst punishment has been imprisonment and the s saw the uk become one of the biggest incarcerators of children in the western world few of the deprivations of adult imprisonment are spared for children they are often held miles away from their families transported in sweatboxes stripsearched put in solitary confinement made to endure hunger and long periods of boredom and trapped in a brutal environment where bullying and toughness reign panic anger and fear disturbing emotions for the person feeling them as well as those around are regularly met with physical force restraint is to prison what bedpans are to hospital part of its routine and so the latest published inspection report of ashfield a young offender institution run by serco reveals that there have been nearly physical restraints a month across the previous year a ninefold increase since hm prisons inspectors last checked the books the inspectorate report also gives harrowing insight into the lives of the disabled children held there last autumn only of these children said staff asked them if they needed any help or support when first admitted felt unsafe and had been victimised by another child just of these disabled children understood the targets in their training plan furthermore several months after the youth justice board yjb announced stripsearching would be riskled inspectors found children were being made to routinely strip off their clothes in september in this single institution there were strip searches inflicted when a child first entered the institution not one unauthorised item was found during these reception searches even in these austere times the yjb plans to buy more than places for children each year the howard league for penal reform reports that more than places in secure childrens homes have been decommissioned by the yjb over the past decade imagine a child health strategy that closed down paediatric wards while investing millions in trying to make the staff and surroundings of adult wards childfriendly last month mr justice foskett in the high court set out in meticulous detail the widespread unlawful restraint that went unchecked for at least a decade in four secure training centres run by serco and gs and since that judgment two more children have died in circumstances that have yet to be established in staterun young offender institution bringing the total number of such child deaths to since yet there has not been a single public inquiry and not one change in the law to strengthen child protection in yois and stcs staff in secure childrens homes are now under a legal duty to systematically record their attempts at averting physical restraint they must log the childs version of events and list any injuries in penal custody the yjb and ministry of justice have still not fully implemented a coroners recommendation made in that children be encouraged to give their own account of restraint officials responded that many children in custody are unable to read or write so having forms where they can give their perspective may not be the best way forward as well as baby peter and victoria climbi the public should know the names and histories of gareth myatt and adam rickwood the two boys who died eight years ago in appalling circumstances following restraint in stcs all these years later there are still no restraint techniques approved for use across all childrens settings and seemingly no plans to reject methods that deliberately aim to inflict severe pain and humiliation the prison reform trust examined the histories of children in custody and found had been excluded from school had been subject to abuse or neglect had witnessed domestic violence had been in local authority care had selfharmed had suffered the death of a parent or sibling and had attempted suicide these statistics show the scale of suffering what they dont reveal is what has been missing from so many of these childrens lives unconditional love affection attention unstinting support and adults showing them that violence and

lying impassively with her eyes shut or looking at the wall she was given alcohol which she drank heavily not least because it numbed her thoughts to what was happening to her it was common knowledge

older girls who was at the time recruited younger girls for the men as well as having sex with them for money the yearold introduced a yearold girl to a number of different men who wanted to have sex with her with or without her consent the younger girl was raped at a takeaway and taken by the man to other places where she was provided to other men for sex one girl who was when the alleged abuse

number gets passed and they pass it to their friends and they pass it to their friends end up with a massive circle everyones got it there were also occasions on which one or more of the girls were so

girls as young as are posting explicit photographs on facebook to advertise themselves to older gang members police say the children who are often already involved on the periphery of street gangs are putting up highly sexualised pictures apparently in an attempt to gain status detective chief inspector petrina cribb who leads a gang prevention programme for the metropolitan police said some of the things you see on facebook are just horrendous very young girls posting pictures of themselves with very little on we are talking about really really inappropriate images of very young girls there is growing concern at the sexual exploitation of girls by street gangs last week the government announced m of funding to help girls involved with gangs who are raped or abused with the equalities minister lynne featherstone describing the violence young women face as shocking while male gang members have posted videos and pictures online often posing with weapons or boasting about their activity for several years cribb whose heart programme supports youngsters at risk of becoming involved in gangs said the problem of young girls sharing explicit pictures of themselves online was not as widely known you have very young girls putting inappropriate pictures of themselves often of sexual poses and inappropriately dressed that is associated with this gang phenomena she said girls who have been involved in street gangs have told the guardian how sexual favours are regularly swapped for drugs and how many young teenagers are trapped in abusive relationships sometimes with more than one male gang member cribb said it was a familiar pattern young girls tend not to be in the gang as such they tend to be more on the periphery they may hide firearms or deal drugs for the gang members but often they are being coerced or manipulated or pressurised into this activity or quite often feel that is just the way life is they dont really realise it is not like that for everybody cribb said that despite their involvement in often very serious criminal activity these girls should also be recognised as victims i think the public sees it as quite polarised there are the people who are offenders and they are in gangs and then there are the people who are victims who are victimised by gangs but the reality i see is that quite often they are the two sides of the same coin she said it was not just bad kids joining gangs but often children in very challenging situations who made what they believed to be a rational choice to become involved it is kids who are under a lot of pressure who are often just trying to survive and what we need to do is provide them with the information and support to make them see that although it may seem like the rational thing to do it is incredibly dangerous and destructive the heart programme is run by experienced youth workers and focuses on reducing the risk of young people committing and or being subjected to violence particularly sexual violence hundreds of school pupils in three london boroughs are being offered workshops conducted by the charity foundation life some of whose youth workers are former gang members cribb said it was crucial that such projects were on hand to offer support to vulnerable young people to help them find a different route through their teenage years when you hear the stories of these young girls you never stop thinking this is a life ruined and it is such a dreadful dreadful waste we need to get in at an early enough age to try and correct these skewed ideas and make them realise they do have a choice and they do have rights and it does not need to be this way last week scotland yard announced an initiative to tackle gang crime in the capital with trident the met unit that has worked to boost community confidence in the police and generate information about gun criminals spearheading a new gang command the met said that since its launch there have been gangrelated arrests in a threeday operation last week and a huge amounts of weapons drugs and cash seized a spokesman said more than half of those arrested have been charged with a variety of offences ranging from gbh and

a female former gang member has exposed the growing levels of sexual violence against young women who join them saying that many are willing to risk being raped in return for the status of membership isha nembhard who was part of an strong gang in peckham south london said some girls readily accepted that they would be sexually abused when associating with male gangs the yearold said that the problem had reached a point where being raped was becoming normalised among many young women girls who are getting treated very badly know what they are getting into they sleep with a boy and the boy asks if she will sleep with all his friends its about low selfesteem and a craving for attention even if they know its wrong they will do anything to get acceptance she said a lot of girls are sort of prostituting themselves to have sexual relationships within a gang and get treated in a bad way for example she might know about what happens to girls in the gang but still sleeps with all of them just for the status nembhard who was a teenage drug dealer said that even those who are abused and called pieces of shit by gang members maintained sexual relationships with them because they felt that they couldnt do better she added that cultural and social trends had exacerbated the problem since she left school when i was growing up girls were more boisterous i used to be a tomboy but nowadays a lot of girls who go to school are more girlygirly and make sure they put on their makeup and wear the right sort of skirts its changed dramatically nembhard said that girls tended to be more sexually active before the age of than before in my day it wasnt like that she said social networking sites like facebook had she added helped to encourage promiscuity among young women youve got young gi rls exposing themselves on there making it normal and so others follow suit earlier this month the home secretary theresa may announced m of new money over three years to tackle the issue as part of the governments revamped antigangs strategy meanwhile a senior scotland yard officer has voiced concern that the problem of young women being sexually abused by male gangs had grown sufficiently large to be classified as a mainstream issue the metropolitan police detective in charge of protecting vulnerable young women from falling into gang culture detective chief inspector petrina cribb said that although police were targeting girls as young as to warn them of the risks associated with male gangs she believed that educating youngsters of the dangers should begin even earlier at primary school cribb also admitted concern about the levels of ignorance among young women about sexual abuse saying that many did not understand that being forced to give oral sex was rape cribb who manages the mets heart programme which educates young people about the risks associated with joining gangs added a lot of young people do not know what is the law particularly with regard to being coerced into oral sex which is rape but some think it is just playing around young girls find that they may have no choice a young girl who is surrounded by a group of boys might feel its normal to go along with it former girl gang members say that despite being aware of the risks many girls with low selfesteem are willing to risk being raped by entire gangs to increase their status the heart programme which involves police local authorities and charities aims to teach women about relationship issues rather than the traditional emphasis on sex education already girls identified as at risk have begun oneonone tutorials for the rest of the year with another workshop places available to teach girls what is unacceptable in a relationship the scheme has so far been introduced in three london boroughs lewisham newham and waltham forest but cribb said she felt very strongly that every school should be delivering a form of relationship education to empower young women we are trying to explain that girls actually have a choice and that consent is key to a sexual relationship she said gifford sutherland of community group foundation life which uses reformed former gang members to educate vulnerable youngsters said sexual abuse was not the only risk that gangs posed to girls not only are girlfriends manipulated by young men for sex but they become associates hiding firearms carrying drugs and sometimes these young girls find that they have no choice the key concern is that this sort of behaviour has been normalised that they go through an initiation process or they are coerced into sex we show that is not a healthy relationship although the met has no detailed data on the numbers of potential victims it believes that the estimated active criminal gangs in the capital account for one in seven reported rapes a survey by the nspcc has suggested that a third of teenage girls have been forced into sexual activity against their will while research by the race on the agenda charity shows that rape is used to punish girl gang members however those with firsthand experience of the way in which gangs operate say that the factors driving such abuse are

it is just over two weeks since londons top prosecutor alison saunders gave a chilling warning that the almost demonisation of women by the media was having a negative impact on the british justice system and leading to acquittals in rape cases this echoed evidence given by end violence against women to the leveson inquiry that prejudicial and inaccurate media reporting of rape sends a strong and consistent message to the justice system and the public more broadly that women routinely cry rape to rape survivors that they will not be believed and to potential perpetrators that they will get away with it two cases this week provide grim confirmation of these concerns at a trial in ireland a complainant who said she had been gangraped and imprisoned by three men was forced to stand directly in front of them to identify them by mr justice paul carney an ordeal that left her visibily terrified according to news reports the next day when she failed to turn up at court after apparently attempting suicide she was imprisoned and in the court of appeal in london a woman is appealing against her conviction for perverting the course of justice her crime falsely retracting an allegation of repeated rape by her husband to be clear it was accepted that her initial allegations of systematic sexual violence were true and that her retraction was false its hard to believe these arent cases in a history book about medieval justice sitting alongside fables about the stocks and witchducking but maybe these cases are not so extraordinary every part of our society seems to be infected by prejudicial attitudes to rape from the justice secretarys comments about rape last year to facebook pages that promote sexual violence to the casual use of rape jokes by top comedians and the outpouring of misogyny on male university students websites hardly surprising then that surveys consistently show that around a third of people in the uk believe that if a woman is raped then she should be held at least partially responsible if she did not behave like a perfect victim either because of what she was wearing or if she had been drinking and of course perpetrators tend to target women who have been drinking so societys attitudes conspire with and reinforce the perpetrator recent research by middlesex university found that lads mags and convicted rapists use the same kind of language when talking about women rape victims of course know this which is why up to of them do not report this most serious of crimes polling by end violence against women has found that in uk schools sexual harassment is routine and unchallenged and that almost a third of girls experience unwanted sexual contact it seems girls and boys grow up in a culture of disrespect towards women and girls where abuse is seen as acceptable so whats to be done we must start the task of changing attitudes to rape and other violence against women this means working with young people in schools so that they understand what consensual healthy and respectful relationships are it means ongoing training for professionals including teachers social workers and criminal justice workers it means longterm public awareness campaigns at local and national levels such as the home offices recent teenage relationship abuse campaign or end violence against womens weareman video aimed at young men and shifting the focus away from womens behaviour we need to tackle the messages we receive through the media whether it is our daily newspapers inaccurately and overreporting false allegations of rape whether it is sexualised music videos and games where women are portrayed as sexual objects there purely for mens pleasure or the threats of sexual violence that women writers and bloggers receive to shut down debate we must grasp the fact that developing technologies the explosion of the internet and the ubiquity of mobile phones has massively increased the ways in which women and girls can be groomed abused harassed and exploited and critically women in every community need to be able to access the kind of specialist support that rape crisis centres offer to help them deal with sexual violence and it means our politicians showing leadership on all of this in short we need a revolution in the way we understand and deal with sexual violence there are opportunities to start making these changes the government is currently revising the national curriculum and the home office is refreshing its violence against women strategy the no backed work on tackling sexualisation is ongoing and must go further in tackling the production of sexualised and sexist images and material which provide a conducive context for violence against women to flourish but if

a woman who was jailed for falsely retracting an accusation of rape against her husband has appeared in court seeking to have her conviction quashed the yearold mother was jailed for eight months in november after she admitted perverting the course of justice for retracting accusations that her husband had repeatedly raped her he had been charged with six counts of rape and the case was discontinued after she changed her position she was charged after later telling police it was the retraction that had been false an earlier appeal reduced her sentence to a community sentence and a twoyear supervision order but on wednesday she was in the court of appeal in london to hear her qc niall quinn argue that her conviction was unsafe and should not stand in front of the lord chief justice lord judge mr justice silber and mr justice maddison quinn said the woman was undoubtedly the victim of prolonged and serious domestic violence and abuse and multiple rape adding that she had been suffering at all material times from a psychiatric disorder although her then counsel had not sought a psychiatric assessment at the time of the original case she had since been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of the rapes and domestic violence inflicted on her the director of public prosecutions keir starmer acknowledged in december there had been failings in the case and ordered a review of crown prosecution service procedures for dealing with women who withdraw rape claims as well as repeatedly abusing her quinn told the court the man had forced his wife to work in a massage parlour providing sexual services for other men he drove her to the premises to this brothel waited for her and took her home again took the proceeds and then proceeded to attack her emotionally for doing what she had done at his insistence and for his gain arguing that the woman had withdrawn her accusations under duress a defence which was not advanced at her trial he said she was not just a victim but an extreme victim and mentally ill at the time in interviews with police he said it was apparent that she felt that she was the guilty party that she was to blame if she had been better none of this would have happened he said what we submit on her behalf is that the system and what should have happened went awry as a result of errors on all quarters alison levitt qc for the crown said it unreservedly accepts the factual background to this case its plain that the woman was subjected to a lengthy period of domestic violence and its implicit in the plea that she was the victim of rape she disputed the womans case showed admissible evidence of duress however saying that the law required there to be a clear threat of death or serious injury while the man and his sister had clearly put the woman under pressure to withdraw the accusations levitt said the woman had told police in interviews she had acted on whats best for the kids being persuaded by her husbands family that she would get at worst a suspended sentence for withdrawing her claims while he had been told by his solicitor he faced years in jail when she was later told she could face a prison term she told police her retraction had been false the pressures must have been dreadful and difficult to imagine but in our submission would fall short of whats required for duress said levitt acknowledging that she was adopting an interesting position levitt said the cps conceded that if we were looking at this case today on the facts that we now have in the light of the policy that we have now developed its unlikely that the woman would have been prosecuted as a result she said the crown was not opposing the success of the appeal but lord judge expressed a concern that quashing her conviction could set a precedent there are hundreds of cases where there is a subsequent change in the law or a change in process he said which were to they all to appeal would leave the whole system in disarray levitt said the cps was making a limited concession in this case only its the crowns view that the womans case falls into a very restricted category if not a unique category in that it was her case that gave rise to the new guidance quinn said that because in the womans case her mental state was not considered at the time of her original trial his submission was very case specific there is a way out of this uncomfortable position the crown are uncomfortable and no doubt your lordships are as well we submit there does not have to be any wider application this defendant has been tried in a way that has turned out to be unfair at a previous hearing the court said it had no power to impose an anonymity order in respect of the woman media organisations have agreed not to name her judgment was reserved

we seem to have a terribly confused attitude to rape in this country britain has one of the lowest conviction rates of any european country only of reported rapes end in a conviction on the charge of rape leading some feminists to consider restorative justice ie meeting your rapist and hearing him say sorry as an alternative to throwing him in clink or treatment programmes rather than punishment then there is the impression thanks to the extensive media coverage of such cases that we are more concerned about women making false allegations of rape than of convicting actual rapists so it jars that such a fuss is made in certain quarters at the thought that an actual convicted rapist quite a rare breed is being deported from australia to britain leslie cunliffe who emigrated from britain in kidnapped gagged blindfolded and bound his victim before strapping a fake bomb to her body and raping her in for this he spent years in prison in australia for the rape now he has lost an appeal against the australian department of immigration decision that he should be deported and has been placed in a detention unit he is not the first such rapist to be deported from australia and the uk immigration service also regularly deports rapists and other convicted criminals currently there is the kerfuffle about the radical islamist cleric abu qatada a man who despite his grotesque views has not been charged with a single crime in britain because we have not deported him to a country that relies on evidence obtained through torture people who have been granted refugee status and other foreign nationals are often stripped of their british citizenship after serving time in jail in this country so why exactly is there such a fuss about a sex offender who has served his time and is on the publics radar coming back into the uk research published in by the crown prosecution service and home office inspectorates estimates that between and of rapes are never reported of those that are almost a third recorded by police as no crime should have been properly investigated as rape shockingly less than of men who rape are convicted of it according to the same research then there is the fact that legislation brought in eight years ago to curtail the inclusion of alleged previous sexual history evidence of the complainant in rape trials has largely failed research found both prosecution and defence share stereotypical assumptions about appropriate female behaviour that tales of her sluttish behaviour is routinely allowed to be raised in front of a jury and that the change in law had no discernible effect on the conviction rate for rape which continued to fall after its implementation britain and the rest of the world seem to operate on the basis that women who report rapes are lying if they are not lying then it is not a real rape if she knew the accused and that if a man is found guilty of rape it is not really his fault that he did it in the first place nimbyism the attitude of not in my back yard is pretty unpleasant particularly when it applies to those who do harm to others i dont want to impose a rapist on the women and children of any country i want them to be stopped from doing it again and more importantly from committing such acts in the first place britain has a terrible track record in dealing with rape so the idea of us becoming irate about australia sending cunliffe back is risible none of us should lose sleep over his return to the uk there are thousands of rapists walking free in this country who may never come on to the radar follow

on a good day amy robsons yearold stepson james is just like any other teenage boy hell happily regale you with the latest footie scores or challenge you to a game on the playstation at his home in cumbria but on a bad day the same teenager has been known to threaten classmates attack teachers and even defecate in the classroom two years ago james was diagnosed with attachment disorder something that occurs when the attachment between a child and a caregiver is not formed during early childhood it was brought on by his chaotic start in life when he lived in a violent household with an alcoholic mother james was eight by the time his father was granted custody of him subsequently james displayed worrying behaviour including refusing to change his underwear for several weeks and threatening to kill himself we hit a crisis point last year as we just werent getting any help robson says finding treatment and support was difficult just getting a diagnosis was a huge task eventually a camhs child and adolescent mental health services worker diagnosed him with attachment disorder but after a long journey with the social worker funding was cut and that was the end of that no more help help could soon be at hand following the award of a government grant to a group of child psychiatrists from hull york medical school to carry out a systematic review to determine which interventions are most effective among parents of children with attachment problems barry wright consultant child psychiatrist and honorary senior lecturer at hull york medical school is leading the review which will publish its findings in he says swift diagnosis and early intervention are vital like a lot of these things the more support you can put in early the more dividends that pays studies have shown that children displaying attachment problems in early life usually go on to have behaviour problems a lot of young people we see who do commit crime on a regular basis often come from troubled backgrounds and often you can see quite clearly there are attachment problems going on there says wright hayley morgan is concerned that her yearold adopted son jon will go to prison jon has been expelled from two schools and involved with the police several times after physically attacking morgan and her husband last year social workers placed him in a care home for the safety of himself and his family jon has got worse since hes been in care hes learning things that perhaps he wouldnt have learnt if he hadnt been there says morgan i am worried he will end up inside its like living with two kids because sometimes hes the nicest boy but hes on his last warning with the police he wants help but where do we go for help when morgan from bristol adopted jon and yearold steve years ago she says she was given a parenting course in preparation for adoption but the issue of attachment was never brought up when he was just four jon used to do some very strange things like saying he wanted to kill himself and throwing himself off the top of the stairs jon is very happygolucky hes very chatty and active but his behaviour got a lot worse over the years she says at one time he pulled a knife on his brother he would see the red mist but then he would break down and cry and say mum i dont know what to do about this anger in december morgan was finally offered a councilfunded course to learn about attachment issues but she says it failed to teach her strategies to cope she was sent on a selfdefence course to deal with the violent behaviour but jon wont be allowed home until social workers believe he wont be a danger to himself and others despite cuts to many camhs services the government insists that the mental health and psychological wellbeing of children is high on its agenda in october care services minister paul burstow announced a m investment in psychological therapies for children and young people with mental health problems including attachment disorder burstow said were breaking new ground with this investment in childrens mental health were working with young people and staff to start to change the way mental health is delivered by the nhs half of those with mental health problems first experience symptoms by the age of and threequarters before their mids this pioneering work will focus on early and effective treatment but morgan says when i was talking to people at the childrens home where jon is they said were getting them too late robson adds we are petrified about the future if we could wish for something it would be for some really good therapy that would melt away his jamess anger we hold out so much hope on a good day he can be a great kid to be around some names have been changed,2012-02,good day amy

two boys died in youth custody last month its a reminder that we reserve our most dangerous and violent jails for children the kids secure estate is dominated by young offender institutions and secure training centres last year of the quarter of a million children arrested only were given custodial sentences it is incredible then that they managed incidents of selfharming and a further incidents of violence the public mistakenly believes that once kids get into the secure estate they are rescued yet the interventions designed to help them are frequently unscientific and rarely successful the children themselves confirm this work carried out by my charity user voice has shown that young people who had hoped to gain an education inside rarely did so in a disorganised system they would be sent on the same course again and again or the course they wanted would be unavailable those who felt ready for gcses found the education provided was too often primary school level they wanted qualifications they said because these might lead them to jobs despite their criminal record and jobs were important more than half of the young offenders we spoke to were clear about what they wanted in the long term the same as everyone else a job a family a home but if violence and selfharm statistics and the statements of the children themselves is not enough to prove how ineffective our incarceration system is there is no better testament to its failure than the dismal reoffending rates between and of the children we incarcerate reoffend within a year the psychologists who assess the children for recognised risk factors have easily discerned that the more risk factors the higher the chance of reoffending the same psychologists reveal that a quarter of the children in the youth justice system have been abused a third have experienced significant bereavement a quarter have been involved with mental health services i wish they spent less time assessing the kids and predicting their descent and a bit more time treating them if a child from a wealthy educated family had drug or alcohol problems after experiencing abuse bereavement or mental health difficulties his family would try to intercept his fall there would be shrinks and rehab centres lined up to save him and the family would devote resources to this children from the underclass dont have those options the youth justice system is the last net and could stop them from crashing to the ground instead they are denied the proper support and rehabilitation they need and their criminal records then exclude them from the jobs and income they aspire to there is one other face of childrens incarceration secure childrens homes local authorityrun and divided into small units with a high ratio of staff to children aim to meet childrens educational and therapeutic needs they mimic as closely as possible what most kids in trouble lack a caring guiding family home guess what the longterm economics of giving these children such support conflicts with the shortterm political imperative to save money most are closing only children of the incarcerated at any one time have a place in secure homes and

if you have sex with a girl and there is no permission what is it a group of year students shuffled their feet and looked down at the ground rape said one boy quietly others nodded the government chose this session at a south london school designed to tackle the issue of sexual violence in gangs to announce new advocates for victims of sexual violence and exploitation in gangs in the worst affected areas of the country the advocates will support victims of rape and sexual abuse and work with vulnerable young people at risk of being targeted by gangs the move comes after the home

at lilian baylis technology school in kennington on thursday lynne featherstone the home office minister for equality said violence against girls in gangs had remained hidden for too long i think people would be shocked if they could see the level of violence and abuse against girls in gangs she said groups working in the area were invited to bid for the advocate positions our first priority is to protect girls who can see themselves as worthless objects to be used in unacceptable ways in the session run by the growing against gangs and violence project the students heard girls could be used by boys in gangs as links casual and disposable sexual partners or be forced to perform lineups a series of sexual acts on boys from the same gang confronted with the example of saffia a yearold girl who was gang raped by a group of boys as punishment for losing her boyfriends drugs package the girls separated from the boys for the session were asked what might have attracted her to her gang member boyfriend she might do it for protection said one yearold nowadays girls think about that because of where they are living if they are in a really bad area they might need protection so they go for a boy in a gang asked what she would need to do as a girlfriend of a gang member the answers came back rapidly have sex with him look after the stuff he gives her guns and that shes always there as an alibi for him when the subject turned to the status of girls in gangs one yearold replied i think they are at the bottom because boys dont think they are important they just get them to do their dirty work next door the boys confronted with the same scenario were being warned of the consequences of being convicted for rape if after prison you go back to your familys house if the girl you raped has brothers uncles what are they going to want asked the session leader in unison the boys chimed revenge asked what they looked for in a girl the boys listed their priorities figure natural beauty no weave good dress sense and with only a little extra encouragement added truthfulness respect and responsibility one boy noted it had to be a girl you could take home to meet your mum could she be in a gang nah he said still it felt like there was work still to be done asked if saffia who before the rape had posted on a social networking website that her boyfriend was a waste of space deserved to be raped most of the boys answered with a shocked no but one boy said kind of you should respect your boyfriend so if you have to look after his property another said yes she shouldnt have dissed him on facebook the leader of the group replied ultimately no one deserves to be raped and thats the end of it after the session yearold abigail owusu said the session had opened her eyes to the treatment of girls in gangs i thought girls were respected more if they were in gangs and it may look like that but they are actually living in fear she said i dont think id let myself be treated like that speaking after the sessions featherstone said the new advocates would focus on creating a coherent programme centred around changing attitudes and prevention once they are in a gang it is very very tough she said its a long and difficult journey and there are no quick answers,2012-02,sex girl permission group year student shuffled foot looked ground rape said one boy quietly others

it may be too late for miriam or moira or even arlene its a bit late for mark thompson to be honest given that he has been director general for over seven years but still better late than never accept the fact that there are too few older women on the bbc in his last year in the job thompson took to the pages of the daily mail to admit that the national broadcaster was getting it wrong and should stop making older women feel invisible there are manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the bbc he writes especially in iconic roles and on iconic topical programmes strange then that just two weeks ago thompson and the bbc were denying there was really much of a problem at all in response to the guardians campaign to get more women on radio s today programme one of its most iconic topical programmes the bbc harrumphed women of all ages feature prominently throughout the bbcs schedules on radio and television there is of course always more we can do to improve gender balance and it is an issue we take seriously what made thompson take it more seriously so quickly insiders pointed to the bbccommissioned survey of licencefee payers last week which discovered a sense that flagship programmes question time qi and mock the week to name a few used token women and treated older ones as a bit of a joke they could also have mentioned the debate in the house of commons recently in which two mps not known for their feminism nadine dorries and tessa munt raged at the culture of sexism at the corporation prompting culture minister ed vaizey to suggest a meeting between all sides thompson could also have referred to the guardians research by kira cochrane that suggested that the media in general was still hideously male to paraphrase a line used by a former dg and that the bbc in its news and current affairs output in particular showed a bias towards men that makes the daily mail seem like the bastion of equality or indeed he could have pointed to the womens blogs call for action over today because the fact that between and of its guests and reporters were women in the period surveyed didnt seem good enough for a programme which more than any other sets the agenda for the days news but whatever made thompson suggest that every bbc editor and producer understand their role in helping us address this challenge it would be churlish not to support him many will argue from thompson to the editor of the today that the issue is a societal one women make up of parliament and of company boards in the uk so when harried journalists want a debate or comment they tend to think of men first they will also argue that the quality of the programme is more important than equality no one wants to see weak broadcasters whatever age sex or class but there has never been any evidence that a diverse nation can only produce talent and expertise in white men besides as thompson acknowledges the bbc has a special responsibility to reflect the talents and diversity of its licencefee payers surely there is something wrong with a stateowned broadcaster which shows young people with its everyday output that for girls at least looks are more important than knowledge thompson admits as much when he says as the national broadcaster and one which is paid for by the public the bbc is in a different class from everyone else and that the public have every right to expect it to deliver to a higher standard of fairness and openmindedness in its treatment both of its broadcasters and its audiences change wont come overnight it probably wont come until long after thompson has attended his last olympics event and left the bbc there are five women on the bbcs strong executive board and two of them could become the first ever female director general of the bbc when thompson stands down what a triumph for the older woman that will be especially if it coincides with a real change in attitude to those invisible women on our television screens,2012-02,may late

a woman went to the police this week after receiving violent threats from fans of online lads mag unilad like many i was shocked and disturbed by the vitriolic attacks on women by the website and its supporters little did i expect that a few days later i would also be on the phone to the police reporting online threats and harassment back in selfstyled breastaurant hooters applied for a licence to open in bristol the bristol feminist network and bristol fawcett launched a campaign objecting to the licence we believe that hooters contributes to the normalisation of the sexual objectification of women a normalisation that negatively impacts on womens selfesteem and leads to an increased tolerance of sexual harassment and violence our campaign was unsuccessful we were told by the licensing committee that a business whose usp is scantily clad women serving hot wings offered something really different to bristol however just over a year later hooters announced that it had closed lets be clear hooters closed not because of pressure from feminists if that was the case it would never have opened but because the managing company went into administration it wasnt making the profit it needed and was involved in a dispute with another business bristol residents chose not to go there and it didnt make money i am sorry that people lost their jobs and sincerely hope that they find new work soon but i believe that the closure of hooters is fundamentally a positive step it shows that a retrosexist establishment is not welcome in our city after a strip club was refused a licence earlier in the month the closure of hooters represents one less business on the high street that seeks to make money by objectifying women hooters supporters started to leave comments yesterday morning on the bristol feminist network facebook page blaming us for its closure this quickly escalated until men started posting sexist insults directed at me bfns spokesperson on their walls next they threatened me with violence they wrote that they were going to come find me and make me pay they started to encourage their friends to harass me too one man said he wanted to kick me in the vagina and his friends liked the comment the men declared they were going to find out my details share them on chan and come after me im a feminist blogger i get a lot of online abuse but these threats of violence were a different matter i called the police last year feminists started speaking out about online abuse threats such as these are a tactic to try and silence women who speak out against sexism and misogyny its a way to try to make us stop by threatening us into silence in my case and the case of many women i know it doesnt work however it doesnt stop it being distressing when they try in one short week we had two incidents of women being intimidated and threatened by two representatives of lad culture hooters and unilad form part of a culture that degrades insults and threatens women in many ways i wasnt shocked with the physical threats and ugly language after all in this culture jokes about harming raping or beating women are par the course they are part of the lad conversation in that world its normal i believe that establishments like hooters and communities like unilad are contributing to the normalisation of this degradation this violent language this view of women as objects the dehumanisation of women by hooters and unilad makes it easy for its supporters to threaten us with violence because they help normalise the view that women are disposable objects and that all too easily leads to a day where a woman is forced to call the police because men have threatened to find her and make her pay for having a voice and using it follow comment is free on twitter commentisfree,2012-02,woman went police week receiving violent threat fan online lad mag unilad like many wa shocked disturbed vitriolic attack woman website supporter little expect

the day i met my rapist a regular in the bar i worked in i was told he was a bit sleazy but harmless he raped me on a saturday morning in september it did not immediately hit me that id been raped i wasnt dragged off the street it wasnt violent a group of us went to my flat after a party and the last thing i remember was sitting in my living room with other people then i woke up on my bed with him on top of me this is not an account of how i was raped this is an account of trying to prosecute a rapist my actions after the event matter because they were examined in excruciating detail by the police and crown prosecution service cps and they are the reason that my rapist is free today i did what i now know to be pretty exceptional i didnt hesitate to call the police but as i waited for them i started to doubt myself i had been drunk i had taken drugs i have a history of sexual promiscuity and mental illness and my memory was very patchy a conviction seemed impossible however when they arrived the police tried to convince me it could happen they took a mouth swab and a urine sample and the next day after a long significant shower i went for a full examination made bearable only by the amazing staff at st marys sexual assault referral centre there were immediate decisions to make notably whether to take antihiv medication which has awful side effects we had to dissect the likelihood of my attacker being hivpositive i took the medication and vomited daily for a month most days violently and repeatedly after vomiting there is no respite you have to retake the pills until you can hold them down i quit my job the day after the assault disgusted and terrified at the idea of seeing him but talked to a colleague who was with me that night realising that i was unconscious she had cleared all the people out my flat he must have hidden and returned i realised these were the actions of a predatory rapist and i felt i had no choice but to try to protect others from him it was then i decided to prosecute at this point the police made one of several inconceivable mistakes they had said that the swabs and bed sheets would be kept for several years however it transpired they had already destroyed all the forensic evidence and blamed my initial hesitation it is easy to vilify the police please dont they made mistakes but they always treated me with as much respect as possible within the confines of their instructions for me the villains of the story are the cps the first interview was gruelling and intrusive however it paled in comparison to the second some months later i was grilled like a suspect i was disillusioned with the process and scared something i said would stop me getting my chance to look him and a jury in the eye and say this is what this man did do not let him do it again terrified i edited my answers and as a result i never got that chance they kept asking me if i had had sexual relations with anyone else there over the eightmonth period and innumerable questions i withheld one fragment of information from the police a piece of information that had no bearing on the rape or my rapist i had been told i had gone into my bedroom earlier that evening with a different man whom i had been kissing i was so scared i would be judged because of this as promiscuous and unreliable of course in this day and age promiscuity should have absolutely no impact on the perception of rape but we all know it does i didnt remember the incident it wasnt my testimony so i convinced myself i didnt need to tell them why should it matter how was something i had done of my own volition relevant to my being raped but the stifling level of scrutiny i was under made me feel sure it would matter so i said nothing a month later i got the call they knew i had lied which made me an unreliable witness the cps had decided not to prosecute they said there was not a realistic prospect of conviction as the jury wouldnt believe me why wasnt i given the opportunity to explain my actions and convince them that i was raped eight months of hell led to that phone call i made a rash decision under pressure because of the stereotypes forced upon women ingrained in our legal system a decision framed from a society obsessed with blaming women for making themselves vulnerable to rape rather than targeting the rapists one wrong decision led to a rapist walking free i cannot forgive the cps for this i cannot forgive them for putting me in a position where i cant forgive myself he doesnt even have to stand in a dock and according to the police and the cps thats my fault with hindsight would i encourage another rape victim to go to the police to face months of interviews examinations and implicit accusations not from a jury but from the police and the omnipotent crown prosecution service i dont know that i could is the law andor society failing women who are raped post your comments below,2012-02,day met rapist regular bar worked wa told wa bit

the police and criminal justice system provides protection to the rich and famous from stalkers but fails to take complaints from the public seriously according to the results of an independent inquiry published on tuesday the parliamentary inquiry set up by a crossparty group of mps chaired by plaid cymrus elfyn llwyd finds that the laws on harassment and stalking are not fit for purpose years after they reached the statute book and are in need of fundamental reform the inquiry which took evidence from victims the police magistrates lawyers and probation staff heard that many victims of stalking have little confidence in the criminal justice system and many felt their complaints were not taken seriously by the police in the rare event that stalking allegations are pursued by the crown prosecution service pleabargaining is prevalent often leading to light sentences with prison terms of more than six months a rarity the report by the justice unions parliamentary group and backed by mps and peers discloses that the decision to create a specific criminal offence of stalking in scotland in has already had a dramatic impact it says the change in the law has led to alleged stalkers being prosecuted in the first months of compared with just in the whole of the previous years under the ukwide protection from harassment act the inquiry found that in england the legislation was used more often to prosecute neighbours arguing about garden hedges and only rarely to deal with stalking david cameron whose brother alexander recently complained to the police about a stalker has admitted there is a gap in the law and strongly hinted he wants to see a new specific offence created the home secretary theresa may has long campaigned on the issue after she took up a constituency case of a mother whose daughter was murdered by a stalker after complaining to the police a home office consultation on whether a specific criminal offence should be created in england and wales closed on monday a home office spokesperson said it is vital that victims of stalking get the support they need from the police and the courts and that offenders are properly punished thats why we have been consulting the public on a specific offence of stalking and the need for better training and guidance for the police and crown prosecution service that consultation only closed yesterday and we need to carefully consider all responses before we act to ensure we get this right but the report from the independent parliamentary inquiry says they need to go further and ensure the public are given the kind of rollsroyce protection afforded to royalty politicians and other key public figures by the metropolitan polices fixated threat assessment centre the unit which was set up in combines police and psychiatric expertise and acknowledges that many people who stalk prominent public figures are severely and acutely mentally ill it combines specialist psychiatric risk assessments with treatment plans and when its methods were put into general use the met they reported a reduction in domestic murders serious incidents and repeat victimisation laura richards of the protection against stalking pressure group told the inquiry that some forces were scaling down or even abandoning the use of such screening programmes and were taking a step backwards by restoring officers discretion harry fletcher of napo the probation union who was an adviser to the inquiry said what you have is the fixated threat assessment centre set up by the met in to protect the rich and famous but the thousands of ordinary people do not get anything in their cases there is no risk assessment and they are not taken seriously by the police and the perpetrators are not tested and so continue with their obsessive behaviour he added that too often the police did not recognise that there was a pattern of abuse and harassment and dealt with each individual incident alone the british crime survey in estimated that up to people were victims of stalking in any one year,2012-02,police criminal justice system provides protection rich famous stalker fails take complaint public

three million girls are still at risk of being subjected to a ritual that is horrific to most of us and against the law in this country female genital mutilation fgm or just plain cutting it is the norm in somalia and sudan where and respectively of young girls are put through it with all the mental and physical trauma that it involves both at the time and in their subsequent lives in the school summer holidays an appalling exodus takes place even from these shores as colleagues of mine reported in this is their article which links to a video british girls are still at risk this afternoon i will be chairing an event convened by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists together with the royal college of midwives for the un international day of zero tolerance of female genital mutilation one of the discussions we will be having is why although a law was passed to protect british girls from being taken abroad for cutting in there have been no prosecutions it is one of the most appalling acts of barbarity against women in many eyes and yet one of the hardest to bring to an end because girls are subjected to it by loving parents who believe it is in their best interests changing cultural attitudes is very hard sister fa is on the case though she is a senegalese hiphop artist who has spoken out against cutting and continues to do so she will be talking to the house of commons and performing in london today this is what she says i am an artist a rapper and an activist and because fgm affected my life so much i want to talk about it i still remember the day when it happened i also know that things are changing and that when people understand they have a choice they are able to change there is hope for the future i am just trying to speak for the many women who dont have an opportunity to raise their own voices i am giving them a voice through my music she has been invited here by the orchid project which was set up to help rid the world of fgm in the audience will be development minister stephen obrien who i have heard expound on his opposition to the practice before here is his view this is a critical but neglected issue that deserves global attention the extremely painful and often disabling consequences of female genital cutting are not only damaging to individual girls and women but also affect their families and livelihoods the uk is working in countries such as kenya somalia and senegal to help communities end this practice and is looking at how we might do more to support its complete abandonment the department for international development dfid is hopeful it believes it is possible to end cutting within a generation mostly by education discussion and gentle persuasion it looks to china where footbinding was an entrenched cultural practice connected to girls marriage prospects that ended within years of the questioning beginning lets hope fgm goes the same way but sooner,2012-02,three million girl still risk subjected

i grew up in a home darkened by domestic violence which i wrote about two years ago my father was an angry and unhappy man who was not able to control his emotions or his hands i witnessed violence against my mother and felt powerless to stop it when refuge the national domestic violence charity asked me to become a patron i accepted without hesitation i accepted for my mother as a child there was little i could do to help her but now i can give support and encouragement to women who live in the same sort of fear that she did forty years ago refuge opened the worlds first safe house for abused women and children in chiswick west london since then it has grown to become the countrys largest provider of domestic violence services on any given day its services support more than women and children refuge and other womens charities in the uk are vibrant innovative and resilient but they are being stretched to breaking point i was shocked to read a new report by the trust for london and northern rock foundation whichhighlights how cuts are crippling vital services such as womens refuges local authority funding has been slashed by and refuge has shouldered cuts to of its contracts on an average day last year women were turned away from refuges because there was simply not enough space for them the impact of these cuts will be devastating the financial footing of womens charities has been shaky for many years now it is in real danger of slipping into the abyss let me be quite clear about what is at stake here without services such as refuges more women and children will be trapped in violent relationships domestic violence rarely peters out on the contrary abuse tends to escalate over time if they cant get help preferably at the earliest opportunity their stories may well have the most tragic of conclusions last year i met an incredibly brave woman called sharon de souza in sharons daughter cassie was brutally murdered by cassies former partner in front of their two small children at the time of her death cassie was trying to flee to a refuge sadly her story is not an isolated one domestic violence kills two women every single week in england and wales if we dont preserve vital escape routes for victims this number already horrifically high will only rise my mother had no escape route there were no refuges she could run to no helplines to call no advocates to speak out for her no one came to help even though everyone knew what was happening behind our closed doors the small houses in our road were close together and every monday morning i walked to school with a bowed head praying that i wouldnt run into a neighbour who had heard the weekends rows the police when they were called were little help i remember hearing them say things like she must have provoked him or well mrs stewart it takes two to make a fight they had no idea my mother did nothing to provoke the violence she endured even if she had violence is an unacceptable way of dealing with conflict enormous progress has been made since then brick by brick year by year pioneering organisations like refuge have built up a broad network of services that respond to the needs of victims sensitively and creatively albeit on a shoestring budget alongside refuges there are specialist services for black and minority ethnic women staffed by experts in complex issues such as honourbased violence and forced marriage independent domestic violence advocates working out of police stations and courts act as the eyes and ears for women going through the legal system ensuring that they get the protection they deserve women who choose not to go to a refuge can be visited by community outreach workers in their homes on park benches at community centres or libraries refuge even helps to find temporary foster places for animals since they understand that women are often reluctant to flee abuse for fear of what will happen to the family pet we cannot risk losing this hardwon network of lifechanging and lifesaving services we cannot stand by and watch as shortsighted budget decisions chip away at these services cut by painful cut besides the obvious risk to human life it is false economics domestic violence takes a heavy toll on the public purse ringing up almost bn a year in health legal medical and housing costs pulling the rug from under the services that prevent this crime and support its victims will only inflate costs further down the line refuge along with other womens charities is facing its toughest year to date the gradual erosion of statutory funding has made refuge even more reliant on voluntary income but fundraising is an uphill battle domestic violence is still shrouded in myth and too few people truly grasp its prevalence in this country more money is given to the donkey sanctuary than to the uks two largest domestic violence charities it saddens me beyond description that women and children experiencing domestic violence today are being left to deal with fear and abuse on their own just as my mother was more than years ago the government says that its ambition is nothing less than ending violence against women and girls but there is nothing ambitious about its relentless demolition of a sector that protects the most vulnerable members of our society to show your support visit

the letter from the committee for ritual abuse january appears to conflate two types of claim one presumably based on solid evidence the other on extremely dubious evidence there is little reason to doubt that within certain communities the use of exorcism rituals against children is on the rise given recent tragic court cases the letter goes on however to bemoan the fact that claims of ritual abuse involving white middleclass children and adults are not taken seriously the latter are not taken seriously because there is no convincing forensic evidence to support them instead they are based upon dubious techniques for recovering memories the same techniques used to recover memories of alien abductions and past lives furthermore the former involve misguided beliefs of religious fundamentalists that a child is possessed in contrast to the latter recovered memories in which the alleged perpetrator is said to be a member of a satanic cult the two should not be confused professor chris french goldsmiths university of london,2012-02,letter committee ritual abuse january appears conflate two type claim one presumably based solid evidence extremely dubious evidence little reason doubt within certain community use exorcism ritual child rise given recent tragic court case letter go however bemoan fact claim ritual abuse involving white middleclass child adult taken seriously latter taken seriously convincing forensic evidence support instead based upon dubious technique recovering memory technique used recover memory alien abduction past life furthermore former involve misguided belief religious fundamentalist child possessed contrast latter recovered memory alleged perpetrator said member satanic cult two confused professor chris french goldsmith university london,"['letter', 'committee', 'ritual', 'abuse', 'january', 'appears', 'conflate', 'two', 'type', 'claim', 'one', 'presumably', 'based', 'solid', 'evidence', 'extremely', 'dubious', 'evidence', 'little', 'reason', 'doubt', 'within', 'certain', 'community', 'use', 'exorcism', 'ritual', 'child', 'rise', 'given', 'recent', 'tragic', 'court', 'case', 'letter', 'go', 'however', 'bemoan', 'fact', 'claim', 'ritual', 'abuse', 'involving', 'white', 'middleclass', 'child', 'adult', 'taken', 'seriously', 'latter', 'taken', 'seriously', 'convincing', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'support', 'instead', 'based', 'upon', 'dubious', 'technique', 'recovering', 'memory', 'technique', 'used', 'recover', 'memory', 'alien', 'abduction', 'past', 'life', 'furthermore', 'former', 'involve', 'misguided', 'belief', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'child', 'possessed', 'contrast', 'latter', 'recovered', 'memory', 'alleged', 'perpetrator', 'said', 'member', 'satanic', 'cult', 'two', 'confused', 'professor', 'chris', 'french', 'goldsmith', 'university', 'london']",16
there were four of us an americanborn entrepreneur the founder of a grassroots feminist movement and two journalists working for different newspapers although we had a lot in common being women for a start we disagreed over a couple of issues quotas mainly i cant remember enjoying a panel more afterwards i turned to twitter to find out what attendees of the guardians open weekend session on gender equality thought and was heartened to find others who seemed to enjoy the chance to spend an hour on saturday morning discussing why so few women reach the top and whether theres anything that can or should be done about it two issues emerged from the response the first was a sort of pleasure in the fact that we females occasionally hold different views in public each woman brought a different perspective which was a nice representation of positive feminist division tweeted francesryan while ineswichert said a great session with a diverse panel that clearly showed that women are not a homogenous group amp have different views yet the single most frequently asked question in the twitter followup can be summed up as where are the men given the number of times this question is posed below the line of this blog it didnt come as a huge surprise but it did get me thinking about the whole numbers game if we can call it that my initial response which i gave from the podium is that there are far too many menonly panels for us to worry about the one without any in saying this i took my cue from the guardians festival director madeleine bunting who said women made up about of the total number of panellists over the whole weekend that was because i was dogged about it it wasnt easy strangely the panellist proportions were in direct contrast to that of the attendees which were male and female but thats another matter what seemed most interesting in this allwoman panel though is that each of us could speak as individuals we werent representing womankind but our own different experiencesopinions research from mckinsey among others suggests that this is common when a group reaches a critical mass defined as about with one or even two women in a group their views can be seen as the womans view so does that mean there would have had to be at least two men on the panel so the man didnt feel as though he was speaking for his entire sex joannar summed all this up up nicely when she said liked the diversity of speaker opinions was surprised by resistance to quotas thought no male pov was a shame it shouldnt really be acceptable to have single sex panels especially on issues which affect us all if i think this about maleonly panels which i do it would be hypocritical not to think it of any other singlesex podium the problem is that the number of events which are dominated by men go unnoticed most of the time only a very few of us and as womans editor im probably one of them ever say where are all the women if more of us did perhaps the debates would always be more diverse and enjoyably so,2012-03,four u americanborn entrepreneur founder grassroots feminist movement two journalist working different newspaper although lot common woman start disagreed couple

a paedophile who sexually abused four young girls after abducting them as they played outside their homes has been jailed for years david bryant who committed a series of assaults on children as young as three during the s and s was caught after coldcase detectives made a breakthrough using dna the yearold originally from ulverston in cumbria kidnapped children over a year period of escalating crimes he snatched a fiveyearold and a threeyearold from the hampshire area in august and may in the first case he grabbed the girl after her mother had gone into their house to get drinks for the children shortly afterwards a couple reported they had found her and a man had run away after a period living in saudi arabia bryant returned to the uk and in may and september abducted two girls aged five and four in newcastleupontyne all four children were indecently assaulted at newcastle crown court on tuesday judge james goss the recorder of newcastle said there had been a distinct pattern in bryants crimes grabbing his victims from near his workplace at the time and assaulting them bryants offending became more serious as he continued to evade capture with the mother of his final victim believing her daughter was dead after she had been missing for hours bryant was arrested last year after a dna breakthrough was made he denied he was the abductor during earlier court hearings but pleaded guilty in january to four charges of kidnap and four of indecent assault the court heard bryant had convictions for similar offences against women aged and over stretching back to francis fitzgibbon in mitigation told the court that because of bryants age the chances of any reoffending were greatly reduced but judge goss questioned bryants sincerity you now say you are remorseful something to which i do not attach a great deal of weight you were clearly not accepting your guilt at an earlier opportunity because of your desire to get away with it there was a distinct pattern to your offences in each case you approached your victims near to where you were working at the time you took them to a private place where you assaulted them bryant was sentenced to years in jail placed on the sexual offenders register indefinitely and barred from working with children speaking after the sentencing detective chief inspector steve binks of northumbria police said for years bryant left these victims and their families traumatised by his despicable actions and has shown absolutely no remorse i cant praise the families and victims enough for their support and strength through this long and traumatic ordeal our investigation led us to presenting evidence to bryant including a positive dna match which left him unable to deny his heinous crimes any longer i hope it brings solace and reassurance to others that no unresolved case is closed we continue to investigate historic cases and with advances in science and technology we can bring justice for victims sometimes many years

a yearold boy was describing to me and a group of other young men his relationships with teenage girls he held firm with his opinion that if a girl came round to his house it implied that she wanted to have sex but there was one boy in the group who even in the face of pressure from the others was certain that even if shes naked shes not supposed to be raped i was interviewing the young men about their experiences of relationships for the female voice in violence project and it was clear that the majority of the boys did not understand the concept of rape they could not see it would you see rape this is the question being asked in the second stage of a government campaign to raise awareness of abuse in teenage relationships the initiative is launched at a time when there is an increasing focus on young womens experiences of sexual violence to date those shouldering the responsibility of rape prevention have been the victims girls are blamed for making themselves vulnerable to rape and their low selfesteem or a craving to belong is the reason we are told that they place themselves in situations where they may be victimised now however it is the turn of those who commit sexual violence to be challenged to recognise it it is right that girls are supported to reduce their vulnerability however there is a growing sense of frustration among girls and some services that work with them that this vulnerability is communicated as the cause of sexual violence the message they hear is that girls are raped because they are vulnerable where they ask is the space to consider the responsibility of those who are perpetrating abuse so a campaign that challenges the perpetrators to ask whether they see rape is welcome girls have told me they are relieved that they are not once again being told to modify their behaviour in order to avoid abuse those same girls would call for services to support victims of sexual violence these are essential however providing services to pick up the pieces or reduce vulnerabilities will never on their own prevent sexual violence until the behaviour of rapists is understood and challenged the abuse will continue the campaign signals a move to reframe and revisit questions about how to prevent sexual violence so it is crucial that the response on the ground is able to mirror this while investment has been made in services for boys and men who commit forms of violence such as gun and knife crime little attention has been given to preventing their use of sexual violence this needs to change young peoples views are shaped by a mosaic of messages images and attitudes professionals need to be supported to challenge these ideas in order to stem the development of abusive attitudes and behaviours challenging the ideas that normalise sexual violence from the outset should underpin any such preventive work the inclusion of men and boys in this debate is critical the young man who condemned rape in the face of peer pressure is not a oneoff we need to understand the difference in attitudes between young men only then will we move from seeing rape to stopping it carlene firmin is a principal policy adviser at the office of the

tonight the bbcs programme my murder will tackle the honey trap case in which teenager shakilus townsend was lured to his death three years ago what i will be looking out for when i watch it will be whether this tragic death has been responsibly set within a narrative that takes into account the pervasive violence that characterises all of these young peoples lives and which often distorts beyond recognition the characters of the girls and young women trying to be part of this violent male world in contrast to the often sensationalist representation of girls and gangs in the media what i hear on the frontline is that girls are not out there doing it for themselves in fact it is quite the opposite they are submitted to a violent male culture in which they struggle to define a role for themselves often and inevitably by whatever means necessary an articulate and likable yearold i worked with happily disclosed that she earned her money delivering girls of and to her male gang member friends at especially arranged parties where the younger girls would be made to perform oral sex on as many as young men and where multipleperpetrator rapes would routinely take place she saw nothing wrong with this saying those young girls give it away for free anyway so why shouldnt she make a little change out of it a yearold who had been coerced into performing sexual acts on young gang members simply shrugged and said that at least these days she was getting paid for it one of the underlying problems with this widespread form of sexual exploitation much of it femaleenabled is that many of the young girls do indeed appear to aspire to be invited to this sort of party and to belong even in this damaging way to a lifestyle they are very attracted to i have lost count of how many young women have carried weapons for their boyfriends hidden guns in their homes carried them into clubs or dropped them at designated locations there is something they get out of these actions that is much more important to them than the risks to themselves and certainly greater than the risk of harm to others there is a powerful and attractive sense of protection that is provided by belonging to any maledominated culture of violence and gang culture offers many different levels of protection to girls and young women all based on ownership you could be protected because you are somebodys sister cousin or girlfriend because you provide favours run errands stow money or weapons or pass information the roles available to you will be in part determined by what you look like how able you are to stand up for yourself and how desperate you are to belong in addition to the normal challenges of growing up and discovering who you are girls and young women growing up in this environment have to navigate the kinds of emotional and psychological complexities that will be impossible for us to imagine as we sit comfortably on our sofas and watch a story on tv about a girl who did something very wrong which led to shakilus townsends death i am not in a position to say what happened that night in thornton heath or what the sequence of events was that led to townsends death but i really hope my murder will give a full and fair representation of all the characters involved in this tragedy and genuinely explore how and why it is possible that so many of our young people put

a few years ago a young woman named natasha shot and killed her boyfriend in the apartment they were sharing he had trapped her in the bedroom and was about to launch into another of what had become weekly beatdowns where he would hit her with a closed fist prior to the killing the beatings had become more severe and more frequent as were the threats that he was going to kill her none of this seemed to count for much at her trial natasha was charged with seconddegree murder and criminal possession of a firearm which was her boyfriends and was ultimately convicted of manslaughter she was given a year sentence and is now in prison along with countless other battered women pdf who found little protection from the criminal justice system when they needed it but who felt the full force of its prosecutorial might when they took steps to protect themselves every state in america has a selfdefense law that allows an individual to use deadly force in situations where a threat to his or her wellbeing is imminent if an intruder enters your home with a loaded gun thereby posing an imminent threat to your life youre allowed to use deadly force to protect yourself when the intruder with the loaded gun metaphorical or otherwise is your intimate partner and living in the house with you the imminence law frequently fails to apply mostly because of the perception that the abused woman could have or at least should have found a more palatable way of ending the violent relationship i asked natasha in a letter if there were other options available to her to escape the abuse short of gunning the guy down she replied as follows you asked if there was any other way to get away from the boyfriend at the time i pulled the trigger i didnt think so hed cornered me in a small bedroom with no way out except maybe jumping out a glass window or simply undergoing yet another beatdown he was fond of beating me then forcing me to perform oral sex on him right away if my lips were bloody hed force himself into my rectum all of this and then some was entered into the record at the psych evaluation like many abused women natasha had made several attempts to escape the relationship only to be brought back by the boyfriend to face harsher beatings and more death threats yet this failure to escape or failure to meet the duty to retreat is one of the main reasons that the selfdefense argument often does not work for women who kill because they think they are in danger of being killed the presumption is that a woman who is in a violent relationship and whose life has been threatened should simply walk away in theory it sounds like a piece of cake just leave when hes asleep or at work or whatever reality is a lot more complicated advocates for battered women cite four main reasons why they tend to not be able to get away the police and courts offer little substantial protection restraining orders and such are about as effective as the paper theyre written on when it comes to deterring a determined batterer shelters are often full leaving is financially impossible especially when there are children involved and finally the women know better than anyone that he will track her down and the violence will be even worse in fact women who leave their batterers are statistically more likely to be killed than women who stay michael dowd a new york attorney dubbed the black widow lawyer for having successfully defended a number of women who killed their abusive partners likens a battered womans predicament to a hostage situation dowd has represented women whose lives in homes with abusive men were as dangerous and hopeless as living in cell in beirut being guarded by terrorists but he writes if a hostage was told he would be killed the next day we would applaud the strangling of a sleeping guard in an effort to escape a woman who kills her husband in the wake of a similar threat is far more likely to greeted with the clanking of the jailers keys than with a round of applause dowd most recently defended a woman called barbara sheehan who shot her abusive husband with his gun sheehans case perfectly illustrates the hostage situation her husband who had subjected her to savage beatings during their year marriage was a police officer so the option of turning to the police for help was not available to her leaving was not an option either because he frequently threatened to kill her and their two children should she do so in case she thought this was an idle threat he kept two guns within reach at all times in their home even while he watching television sheehan was acquitted of the murder but sentenced to five years in prison for unlawful possession of a firearm the same firearm her husband had so often threatened to kill her and their children with in a more just society she would have been compensated for the years of abuse she suffered at the hands of a husband whose job it was to uphold and enforce the law but like natashas case and so many other womens sheehans story illustrates that even now in our criminal justice system is much betterequipped and much more likely to prosecute and punish abused women than it is to protect

an elite metropolitan police squad has come under fire in a highly critical report commissioned by the london mayor boris johnson for its investigations into sex trafficking in the runup to the olympics the report accuses officers of a heavy handed approach to brothel raids and of failing to find victims of trafficking the report silence on violence from london assembly member andrew boff is being considered by johnson it criticises the police performance and estimates that they have a success rate of less than in finding trafficking victims during brothel raids police had predicted an increase in sex trafficking in the runup to the olympics but they have admitted that they have failed to find any evidence of a rise in the five olympics host boroughs that is despite a cash injection of from the government office for london to specifically target the crime both local police officers and the mets specialist scd unit which focuses on human exploitation and organised crime carry out brothel raids both are condemned in the report for failing to adopt an intelligencebased approach to trafficking and for looking in the wrong place to find victims the information i have gathered demonstrates that police have been proactively raiding sex establishments without complaint nor significant intelligence that exploitation is taking place writes boff in the report he adds that the attitude of some sections of the metropolitan police to policing sex trafficking appeared to be based on little or no evidence of particular concern is the failure of police to find girls and women trafficked from west africa thought to be the largest group of victims they are rarely found in brothels and are more likely to be exploited in closed communities the poppy project which works with victims of trafficking said that women from west africa are the largest group they work with of nigerian women they have worked with since just nine were referred to them by the police these women are not coming forward to the police so the police need to be more creative about how they find them said abigail stepnitz poppys national coordinator the experience of one yearold girl who was trafficked from west africa is typical i was locked in a house in london by my trafficker he brought so many different men there to rape me i was never allowed to leave the house and was never taken to a brothel the police didnt interview me until a few months after i escaped i was very scared of them and didnt want to tell them anything georgina perry manager of open doors an nhs project in east london working with sex workers condemned the policing of sex work in the capital there has been a sharp increase in raids and brothel closures in the olympic boroughs as a result women have been displaced to areas where they have no access to support and services the police approach has been very heavy handed and mistrust and fear of them amongst sex workers is at an all time high women are terrified to report violent crimes that take place against them for fear of being arrested this situation neither helps to bring real criminals to justice nor gives intelligence that may combat trafficking boff said i believe the police have spent a lot of time trying to find victims of trafficking in the places where they are unlikely to be the political drivers have been wrong on this scd is barking up the wrong tree one of my starkest findings was the absence of west africans among the women found by scd these victims wont be found by going into a massage parlour and asking everybody whether they have been trafficked by going in in this way they are driving some of these women further into the shadows there is evidence of increasing fear of the police amongst sex workers which has resulted in a reluctance to report crime he called on the police to rethink the way they investigate sex trafficking and to build better relations with sex workers a spokesperson for the mayor said the mayors office for policing and crime mopc has commissioned an independent study into sex trafficking and prostitution in london andrew boffs report has been received and will be considered as part of the mopcs study which will be published later this year a metropolitan police spokesman said in general terms scd has had significant success in saving people who have been trafficked and forced into prostitution although we have not seen any evidence of an increase in trafficking of sex workers so far in the olympic host boroughs officers will attempt to identify and assist victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation and seek the prosecution of those responsible case study fatima changed name west africa fatima grew up in a remote village in west africa she does not know what happened to her parents but she was informally adopted by a childless couple soon after birth the couple used her as a domestic slave and her body is covered with scars from beatings with various implements which she received from a very young age the couple did not allow her to go to school and she is illiterate at the age of the couple sold her to a man she had never seen before she has no idea what price she was sold for but was happy to leave her village with the man the man was very nice to me he gave me good food to eat and told me that he was going to take me to saudi arabia to look after children he also said i could go to school i was very happy to be leaving my village and hoped that my life was going to improve i had always wanted to go to school and at last i was going to get the chance but instead of taking her to saudi arabia the man took her to sierra leone where he obtained a false passport for her for the first time in her life she saw electricity and television from sierra leone she and the man flew to london here he locked her in a house and invited men from many different backgrounds round to the house to rape her i dont know if the men paid money to do this i never saw any money she said i was very frightened when i was locked in that house i didnt want to go back to my country all i wanted to do was die i used to stand by the locked upstairs window and thought about jumping out and killing myself so that i could end my nightmare after a few months fatimas trafficker allowed her to go outside to put the rubbish out he told me to come straight back inside but i ran away i stopped two people in the street and asked them to help me they gave me some food and took me to the home office in croydon home office officials placed her in a hostel with people from other countries it was very noisy and people were drinking alcohol im a muslim and i didnt like this i was scared she claimed asylum and was given accommodation in london she was taken to see a doctor for a check up and to her horror was told that she was pregnant as a result of one of the rapes it was not until a few months after her escape that she was interviewed by police i was very unhappy because the police asked me questions and filmed me i thought they were like journalists and would put the film about me on tv so i didnt want to talk to them,2012-03,elite

the conviction rate for rape is that bears repeating the conviction rate for rape is the conviction rate for reportable crimes of all types is i know you will have heard the figure of everyone has that figure is actually an attrition rate not a conviction rate and even as an attrition rate it is wrong the attrition rate for rape is in the region of an attrition rate is the amount of convictions resulting from reports of a crime and is not routinely calculated for any crime other than rape therefore without manually undertaking the exercise it is impossible to compare the true attrition figure for rape with other crimes a conviction rate is the amount of convictions following a trial and is calculated for all reportable crimes why is this important because the rhetoric of rape which largely propounds myths puts survivors off reporting the crimes committed against them making them perceive that the system designed to assist them is actually wholly against them last week mumsnet released a survey of its users as part of its we believe you rape awareness campaign sixtyeight per cent of respondents said low conviction rates would make them hesitate to report a rape due to low conviction rates clearly they had heard the figure too it isnt just conviction and attrition rates that are an issue and which impact on rape reporting the whole discourse about rape is mired in myths and halftruths which leads survivors to believe the system is against them and that they are unlikely to be believed last week the court of appeal heard the appeal against conviction in what has become known as sarahs case in sarah reported that her husband had raped her after the prosecution had started she retracted that allegation then subsequently withdrew the retraction sarah was convicted of perverting the course of justice and sentenced to eight months in prison in respect of the sentence the court of appeal moved quickly and sarah had her sentence reduced to a community sentence after she had served three weeks in prison the director of public prosecutions keir starmer made it clear he was appalled sarah had been prosecuted and swiftly changed the guidance so that in future prosecutions can only be brought in such cases with his permission sadly the way sarahs case was commonly reported last week can only be described in some instances as hysterical there were the expected headlines of rape victim sent to prison for withdrawing allegation with little explanation that such a thing is highly unlikely to happen again owing to the change in guidance and that the court of appeal had very quickly ordered sarahs release i asked vera baird the former solicitor general and one of the commentators on sarahs case to make it clear that we were unlikely to see this situation repeated because of the change in guidelines in order to ensure survivors would not fear that what happened to sarah would happen to them sadly she responded that i was optimistic and that the police would simply use the charge of wasting police time in order to get around the guidelines and that the crown prosecution service would not change the guidelines for that offence to match the change made to perverting the course of justice as the law stands the guidelines on wasting police time are the same as perverting the course of justice in that prosecutions require the consent of the dpp it is unfortunate the former solicitor general did not seem to know this what i would like to see is openness about rape the myths the halftruths and the nowhere near the truths do not help survivors come forward never mind helping them come forward with any confidence i would like to see the full picture being presented i accept there is still huge scope for improvement in the criminal justice system in the way victims are treated but change has happened and will continue to happen and we need to get that message out there too this article was commissioned after a suggestion from

there are big questions for the justice professionals in the saga of sarah whose conviction for perverting the course of justice by wrongly retracting a rape allegation was upheld on tuesday by lord judge the lord chief justice it would have been hard for the court of appeal to reverse a guilty plea tendered at trial by a woman of full age legally represented and who on lord judges view committed this crime it might be said if you wanted to avoid that conviction you shouldnt be starting at the court of appeal it is a catastrophic case for the already sexually and physically abused victim who has now been imprisoned separated from her children and unless there is an appeal to the supreme court will be a criminal for the rest of her life it is equally catastrophic for the public since a man the authorities were satisfied had raped sarah and who broke bail and perverted justice is not only free but has never been prosecuted the questions are simple first why did any judge grant bail to a man charged with six counts of raping his wife police and the crown prosecution service agreed there was evidence to charge ray who was remanded in custody but three weeks later freed by a judge he therefore had the chance to pressure sarah into withdrawing her case one reason to refuse bail is the seriousness of six charges of rape another is that the defendant is likely to interfere with witnesses there could hardly be a case in which that risk was likelier sarah described how she was so within rays control that she was not allowed to keep her own purse driving licence or bankers card when she called the police he told their child that mummy was having him taken away and wrote to his children four times during three weeks on remand that prison was horrible he showed every sign of a man who would pressure her to drop the case and since he had controlled her for nine years had every chance of succeeding to bail him on condition that he should not contact her appears to reflect abysmally low recognition that domestic violence is about power and control and is likely not to end but get worse when the victim tries to escape the second question is why didnt the police arrest and charge ray when he broke bail and perverted justice by contacting sarah to withdraw her complaint when she first rang to withdraw she says the officer responded from the moment he got bail he got to you ray had indeed got to her she told how he called and texted persuaded her to take their children to see him cried at the prospect of returning to jail and told her to stop the case arresting and charging him should obviously have followed with the cps determined to proceed even without sarah she telephoned the police again this time to say that no rape had ever happened she had lied she doesnt seem to have been believed sarah says that when she ultimately told the senior policeman that her allegations were all true he said i thought it was only a matter of time before you came to me and said yes they did happen she says that ray had sent his sister to say how helpful sarah would be if she said she had lied she gave her the phone and drove her to the police station police believed the retraction to be untrue and having failed for a second time to tackle rays pressure on sarah arrested her for succumbing to it ludicrously they charged her with lying in saying that her rapes werent true ready to prove against sarah that ray had raped her instead of proving it against him the code for crown prosecutors requires that the cps decides whether any proceedings are in the public interest question one how could any prosecutor decide that it was in the public interest to prosecute sarah question two why didnt they prosecute ray for pressuring the retraction oh and for rape a further question is as to her plea of guilty lord judge said today that there was no evidence that sarah feared violence when she retracted and so the defence of duress when somebodys free will is overcome so they act out of fear was not realistically available her original defence team may take comfort from that but what jury would have convicted her in a trial in all the awful circumstances set out above now anyone who is raped by a partner already a hugely difficult offence about which to complain will expect the justice system to let him pressure a withdrawal and punish her if she gives way many women may think it safer to stay silent that is not what we want women to do it is long overdue for police prosecutors and judges to learn about domestic violence and to give women the

the court of appeal has refused to quash a criminal conviction against a mother of four young children who was jailed for falsely retracting an accusation of rape against her allegedly violent and abusive husband despite accepting that the yearold woman known as sarah was suffering posttraumatic stress disorder at the time she retracted her allegations of rape the court said he could not quash a conviction on a broad somewhat nebulous basis of unfairness where the conviction following due process is in every respect safe because the woman was undoubtedly guilty of a serious crime the decision has been described by sarahs legal team as extremely surprising and disappointing the distinguished team of lawyers and domestic violence experts who are defending her for free described it as one of most important judgments to come out this year on womens and thus human rights david malone head of grays inn square chambers and part of sarahs team said he was shocked that a prosecution that should never have been brought had been upheld he told the guardian the team was discussing with the woman whether to take the case to the supreme court to push for a change in the law this was not a case in which justice was done or seen to be done said malone the law simply cannot tolerate a situation whereby such an injustice is maintained because of perceived constraints in the current legal framework clearly the law must accommodate justice being done in this case or it should be changed the welsh woman was jailed for eight months in november after she admitted perverting the course of justice for retracting accusations that her husband had repeatedly raped her he had been charged with six counts of rape but the case was discontinued after she changed her position following she says extreme pressure from her husband and his sister she was charged after later telling police it was the retraction that had been false but the woman was undoubtedly the victim of prolonged and serious domestic violence and abuse and multiple rape according to her lawyer niall quinn qc her husband has never been convicted but alison levitt qc acting for the crown conceded at the appeals court in february that it unreservedly accepts the factual background to this case its plain that the woman was subjected to a lengthy period of domestic violence and its implicit in the plea that she was the victim of rape quinn told the lord chief justice lord judge mr justice silber and mr justice maddison in an earlier hearing that as well as repeatedly abusing sarah her husband had forced her to work in a massage parlour providing sexual services for other men he drove her to the premises to this brothel waited for her and took her home again took the proceeds and then proceeded to attack her emotionally for doing what she had done at his insistence and for his gain he said sarah served days of her jail sentence before being released by lord judge she was instead given a community sentence and a twoyear supervision order but her criminal record still stands despite quinn maintaining the conviction was unsafe because she had withdrawn her accusations under duress at a time when she had been suffering from a psychiatric disorder malone said that if the yearold woman who has already gone through hell has the strength to appeal he would be keen to continue the fight on her behalf sarahs conviction was upheld said the court on tuesday because there was no admissible evidence of duress a legal term necessitating proof that there was a clear threat or serious injury lord judge said the contemporaneous evidence available to the appellants legal advisers once she had decided to tell the truth provided a great deal of mitigation but no viable defence of duress if she had been threatened by him with violence if she did not withdraw the complaint as it seems to us it is inconceivable that she would not have said so at the time that she retracted her allegation of rape if she was asserting that he forced a retraction by raping her or threatening to rape her there was no reason why she should not also have explained her retraction of the rapes by reference to any such threats he added even her most recent statement does not suggest that she was threatened with violence during this period and in particular at the time when she made her false retractions we can see no basis for concluding that the appellant felt exposed to violence or the threat of violence when she made the false retractions on which her prosecution was founded the defence of duress was not realistically available and faced with the material now available no responsible counsel would have advised her that the case should be contested on this basis the judgment is a bitter blow to sarah and her legal team in december keir starmer qc the director of public prosecutions offered a public apology to sarah in a letter to the guardian he wrote that the crown prosecution service had made mistakes in the way it had pursued some women who retracted rape allegations including sarah he said there have been cases recently where i do not consider justice was done or was seen to be done apologies and legal explanations offer scant comfort to a victim and the public are rightly reluctant to place their trust in public authorities unwilling to accept their failings we need to work on our approach in retraction cases from now on my approval for charging will be needed in these cases and we will monitor them closely if the victim has decided to withdraw a rape allegation we must explore the issues behind that particularly if the victim is under pressure or frightened the judgment was also unexpected because in february levitt said if we were looking at this case today on the facts that we now have in the light of the policy that we have now developed its unlikely that the woman would have been prosecuted as a result she said the crown would not oppose the appeal if it was successful,2012-03,court appeal ha refused quash criminal conviction mother four young child wa jailed falsely retracting accusation rape allegedly violent abusive husband

following a petition by cambridge university womens campaign a group of protesters will later this afternoon meet outside greater st marys church in cambridge they are marching to the union society to demonstrate against a speakers event invitation to dominique strausskahn and i will definitely be joining them i think that an institution like the union has a responsibility to reject a speaker with a record of serial misogyny in the same way that i feel that they would have a responsibility to reject a speaker with a record of serial racism for me dsks behaviour certainly fulfils the former category take for example the case of journalist tristane banon of which the prosecutor said in a statement contained facts that could be qualified as sexual assault in addition to this his international renown as a womaniser speaks volumes but perhaps most distressing is his approach to the allegations made by nafissatou diallo the issue isnt whether or not strausskahn raped diallo our focus rests with his argument that previous lies told by the maid invalidate any future claim of suffering sexual violence a stance the prosecutors also effectively took when they later dropped charges for me and many others attendance of the protest is part of a wider rejection of the cultures of misogyny and rape apologism the protest is particularly directed against the treatment of diallos attempt to make rape allegations as this mirrors a persistent international trend the trivialisation of sexual crimes and accusations this is a theme all too prevalent in england where the conviction rate for reported rapes in england and wales is on the full charge of rape part of the event later on will be an inclusive platform to discuss these issues the union society argues that their invitation extends to an economist and that his personal life is irrelevant they reject the womens campaign belief that dsks reputation is as much based on his notorious misogyny as his economic involvement while the personal life of strausskahn should not be subject to our judgement by treating numerous women appallingly dsk has forced the situation the campaign has been condemned by some for allegedly repressing freedom of speech indeed the union society defends his invitation on these very grounds ive always been a staunch defender of freedom of speech but i do understand that there is a difference between systematic oppression and the provision of a platform for the public the union is often assumed to represent cambridge not least because of confusion with the students union a separate body thus the invitations offered by the union make a significant statement access to such a platform should be managed responsibly freedom of speech does not equate to a right to a powerful platform ive found the womens campaign quite an empowering platform myself it has engaged with the theme of international womens day connecting women inspiring futures the demonstration is set to provide an inclusive space to talk about issues from rape apologism to cultures of misogyny far from oppressing freedom of speech i feel like the overwhelming support for the campaign has given voice to those many who live without a direct line to the media what started as a smallscale campaign has snowballed bringing issues of sexism and sexual crime in to the national sphere in addition some protesters are also using the opportunity to express dissatisfaction with the imf while some individuals have felt the need for direct action separate to the official protest i particularly respect the campaigns ability to create a strong response without having impinged on the union societys rights despite the retention of the invitation i feel like the campaign has won a wider victory before the protest has even started weve brought issues that are so often overlooked to a broad audience this article was amended on and march the original referred to a conviction rate of for rape this is the proportion of reported rapes in england and wales that end in a conviction on the charge of rape itself as distinct from lesser assault charges the article has been clarified accordingly a

violence is not always physical the most serious sexual assault i have ever experienced began with a wolf whistle my perpetrator thought that both his whistle and what he did to me after that which definitely was physical were equally permissible whether its leering catcalls shouts or whispers from strangers defending this behaviour is a gateway to the cultural acceptance of much more serious crimes across the spectrum of genderbased violence dismiss the smaller issues and the bigger issues go unchallenged too its hard for some people to get their heads around especially those who have never experienced it but these seemingly harmless interactions with strangers on the street can build up a well of resentment internalised shame and guilt in the people who live with them the same goes for the collective consciousness of millions of sexual assault survivors hollaback activists from mumbai to mexico believe that any behaviour that stops you from feeling safe in public even for a moment is street harassment that a compliment even if wellintended is only a compliment if it feels good this is not about being antiflirting but there is a huge gulf between paying someone a compliment with courtesy and respect and invading their personal space or shouting uninvited remarks todays formal albeit theoretical recognition by david cameron that all women have the right to live free from violence is obviously a great step forward however the uk has had since last may to commit to signing the pledge to criminalise verbal nonverbal or physical sexual harassment one of the commitments in the council of europes convention of violence against women it only did so after proposing changes that make for chilling reading including deletion of the term right to live free from violence and the outright removal of the reference to violence against women as a human rights violation precisely what the impact a convention of this kind would mean when stripped of that clause im not sure on the one day of the year when these issues are given the priority they so desperately need how will these changes realistically protect women every other day it speaks volumes that the focus across the media has been in defence of wolfwhistling you women love it really is rape culture when this is the least serious of the many offences covered by the convention the fact that this convention recognises the everyday damage done to women and girls in this way is something europe should be proud of but the coalition taking credit for this progressive sweep is difficult to take against a backdrop of massive cuts to both police budgets and womens services in this country harassers neednt worry too much that theyre going to hear sirens the next time they shout obscenities at a woman and fears that building sites across the land will now be raided at the first sign of a puckered set of lips are probably unfounded what this has done is raise the stakes for everyone to examine their own behaviour like the harasser we heard about last night in a workshop at queen mary university who shouted abuse while carrying his baby girl in his arms intervening in a safe and productive way when you see a woman being harassed might just make someone think twice about doing it again so many of the crucial care shelter advocacy and counselling services for survivors of all forms of sexual violence across the country are now teetering on the brink the next step in camerons worthy crusade should undoubtedly be a full investigation into how we safeguard womens services lest the state itself become guilty of precisely what this convention seeks to prevent there is no reason that sexual harassment in the street should be any more permissible than racist language we can change attitudes with or without the government and we will julia gray codirector of hollaback london helped writing this article,2012-03,violence always physical serious sexual assault ever experienced

are there enough women on the tv and in our media in general previous posts and the womens blogs campaign to change the today programme make it pretty clear what i think but now it seems that senior producers at channel and sky news agree both organisations have signed the pledge organised by broadcast magazine to work to improve the ratio of maletofemale experts the campaign comes after research from city university showed that male experts outnumbered females by a ratio of four to one across five major tv and radio programmes last year bbc radio s today programme was the worst offender with six times as many male experts in one fourweek monitoring period which after kira cochranes research last year for the guardian comes as no surprise in signing the pledge channel s head of output ben monrodavies wrote sometimes when we host a debate that comprises three or four white middleaged men it is with a heavy heart because that lineup isnt surprising they might be excellent competent engaging speakers but unless the debate is about white middleaged men they arent necessarily reflective of who the topic might affect while asking for the same mckinsey has done interesting research on why scale matters in decision making the broadcast pledge stops way short of the quotas being mooted for women in the boardroom by the european commissioner viviane reding among others this week yet still the bbc has refused to sign stating in a piece of semantics worthy of monty python that the diversity of its licence fee payers actually rules out signing anything as the bbc is funded by all licence fee payers we cannot endorse individual campaigns and our guest booking has to reflect the choice of leaders and spokespeople by organisations and society at large that said our news programmes are endeavouring where possible to increase the use of female spokespeople in all major stories its hard not to agree that if political parties businesses public bodies charities and pressure groups were prepared to promote more women to leadership positions media organisations such as the bbc and indeed the guardian would not have to work hard at all to encourage greater diversity yet the bbc which i am an enormous fan of is consistently failing to lead the way on this is it really good enough to blame society at large for the medias failures the industry is a special case because it affects how society sees itself to put it another way if girls only hear older men asked their opinions while women are confined to the margins why should they grow up thinking their own opinions matter the stateowned selffunded channel gets this enough to at least show willing as does the news channel partowned by rupert murdoch to add to the sense that this isnt just about numbers the research from city which gained a grant to study five programmes throughout found where women were used it was overwhelmingly as case studies or victims so when the deeper voices on today are interrupted by a higher tone the women are normally speaking of their problems im not denying that this is a tricky issue many media organisations speak of the fact that fewer women agree to go on the radio or tv and speak up this could be an issue of childcare or confidence or maybe just the fact that there are always going to be people men as well as women who dont like appearing on the tv or radio the bbc should sign up to the pledge and do more than issue key programmes with a database of women experts after all it is the only broadcaster with a fulltime head of diversity and a requirement as a public body to take active steps to reduce inequality where possible otherwise mark thompsons mea culpa over older women on the front page of the daily mail will just seem like window

the home office has announced it will pilot a new domestic violence disclosure scheme known as clares law the campaign for this scheme was spearheaded by michael brown the brave father of clare wood who was brutally murdered by a man known to the police for a string of violent offences against other women i admire michaels courage in fighting for change but i do not think that this disclosure scheme is the answer in my eyes it is another way for the government to sound tough on domestic violence while actually doing very little the disclosure scheme will give people the right to ask about a partners previous convictions i am not opposed to the underlying concept that sharing information about violent perpetrators may help prevent further crime but current legislation already allows this to happen as it stands the public has the right to ask about an individuals previous convictions and the police have the power to disclose that information where it could protect potential victims indeed this is what should have happened in the tragic case of clare wood the police knew about her killers violent past and they should have disclosed this information to her but more importantly they should have responded to clares urgent pleas for protection clare reported george appleton to the police on numerous occasions including for a serious sexual assault she described his threats to kill her the police arrested and bailed him at one point arresting him after he had breached his bail only to immediately dearrest him this is the real crux of the matter what good will costly bureaucratic new schemes do when the police so consistently fail to perform the most basic duties towards victims of domestic violence refuge has worked on a number of highprofile cases where basic police failings have been shown to have contributed to the death of a woman numerous ipcc reports into domestic violence homicides have highlighted poor practice in critical areas such as investigating allegations responding to calls collecting evidence and performing risk assessments the police dont need new schemes they simply need to understand and implement the law as it stands in this time of austerity precious funding should be spent on improving the quality of specialist training for officers gaining a deeper grasp of the complex dynamics of domestic violence would help officers respond more appropriately to victims and better understand when a woman like clare wood is at severe risk of harm there are other problems with the new disclosure scheme for one thing it rests on the flawed assumption that women will just leave if they discover that their partner has a history of violence at refuge we know that this is a vast simplification there are many practical and psychological barriers to leaving a violent partner research also shows that women and their children are at the highest risk of homicide at the point of separating or just after separating from an abuser if a woman chooses not to leave her partner will she be blamed if he goes on to attack her will she be at risk of losing her children to the care system will the police believe her calls for help we already find that negative attitudes towards victims persist in many police forces and we are concerned that this new scheme could unwittingly reinforce this ugly appetite for victimblaming how many women will actually use the scheme which of us realistically would visit a police station to enquire about a new partners criminal past during the first flush of a romance some supporters have said that if it saves one life it will be worth it this is missing the point domestic violence takes a huge death toll in this country the police receive a domestic violencerelated call every seconds every single week in england and wales two women are killed by a current or former partner untold numbers of children are also witnesses and victims of abuse this is a crime on a gigantic scale the response to it should be concerned with helping the majority of victims we know that the most effective way to do this is to improve the police response to victims and to invest in a broad

the domestic violence charity refuge could face closure this summer amid funding cuts of its chief executive has warned the charity which supports women and children has seen funds decimated and is now fighting for our very survival sandra horley said she spoke out after reports that hundreds of domestic violence victims are being turned away from womens refuges every day because of a lack of spaces the guardian revealed earlier this year that funding from local authorities to organisations working with domesticviolence and victims of sexual abuse fell from m in to m in the current financial year the cuts have prompted accusations that the coalitions austerity measures are unfairly affecting women and putting them directly at risk horley said as ceo of refuge for nearly three decades i have never been so worried about our future the domestic violence sector is being decimated refuge is stretched to breaking point we are now fighting for our very survival desperately trying to raise voluntary funds to keep our doors open if we dont do this by the summer we may face closure what kind of a world do we live in where women and children are beaten and funding for services to protect them is being withdrawn britain is in danger of returning to the days of cathy come home when the vulnerable were forced to sleep rough abused women could find themselves in a dilemma stay at home and risk being killed or flee with their children to sleep on the streets horley also questioned the governments intention to introduce clares law a new disclosure scheme which enables women to request information from the police about their partners previous convictions she said the domestic violence sector did not support the initiative and she believed funding would be better invested in improving the basic police response to domestic violence which is still extremely poor in forces across the country last year two refuges looking after women from ethnicminority backgrounds were closed official estimates suggested there were incidents of domestic violence in the uk last year around women seeking refuge from abusive partners were turned away because of lack of spaces every day campaigners said earlier this year lynne featherstone the home office minister for equality denied there was a crisis in the domestic violence support sector she said i would rebut very firmly that the sector is in crisis this government is putting its best foot forward and is committed to ending violence against women and girls but vivienne hayes the chief executive of the womens resource

the murder of kristy bamu tortured to death because his attackers believed he was a witch has been greeted with disbelief and horror that a child should be subject to such barbaric cruelty is almost beyond comprehension however if we are to learn anything from this terrible case and better protect children it is essential that we do not allow this debate to become solely focused on the belief in witchcraft or a sense that this is an alien concept but understand this for what it is a horrific form of child abuse since the tragic murder of victoria climbi years ago we have known that witchcraftbased abuse takes place in the uk however we are yet to develop effective ways to combat it what is worrying is the tendency to view this abuse differently from other forms dealt with by social services the police and schools although it feels instinctively uncomfortable these cases do not require a special response existing child protection tools can be used as the abuse manifests itself within the four recognised categories physical sexual emotional and neglect there are currently children on atrisk registers in the uk and the nspcc reports that two children a week die through abuse we need to make sure all frontline staff feel equipped to handle all forms of child abuse including those linked to a belief in witchcraft and spirit possession in one particular case a yearold boy in london was prevented from going to school and being seen by a gp or specialist by his parents he was autistic and his parents believed he was possessed the family were investigated by the police and social services many of the groups i have worked with have been helping parents and young people to understand childrens rights normal child development and disability so that conditions such as autism are not misinterpreted fortunately in this case a charity that had expertise in this issue helped the family to access the support their child needed any suggestion that this level and type of abuse is endemic to an african culture is plainly wrong the cases of sexual abuse by catholic priests eunice spry a jehovahs witness who forced sticks down the throats of her foster children and made them eat their own vomit or khyra ishaq who was starved to death because her muslim mother and stepfather believed she was possessed by an evil spirit were all received in horror and condemned by their faith communities we are in no doubt that african communities are committed to combating child abuse over the last five years trust for london has been working with communities on this issue training church officers this has helped to educate people about childrens rights and given people the strength to disclose other types of abuse not all linked to a belief in witchcraft or spirit possession weve also helped frontline employees in the police education and social services to understand faithbased abuse organisations we fund such as uk congolese safeguarding action group churches child protection advisory service and africans unite against child abuse have created forums for parents and children to discuss this issue many children can now spot the signs of faithbased abuse and challenge parents or pastors when they suspect this is happening only by working together will we really be able to prevent the mistreatment of children by those who should be caring for them in addition three things need to happen the excellent work done by community groups needs to be extended and given the necessary financial support local safeguarding children boards need to reach out to faithbased organisations and all of us need to report any concerns we have about the welfare of a child and not fall prey to those who try to hide behind religion or culture to justify their

police are in danger of encouraging predatory men to rape women by discrediting victims in their investigations the former senior metropolitan police officer brian paddick has claimed in a guardian interview paddick warns that some detectives adopt a she wants it really attitude to women alleging rape and sometimes refuse to acknowledge that some types of men such as licensed cab drivers can be rapists the former deputy assistant commissioner is placing the mets mixed performance on dealing with rape at the heart of his campaign as the liberal democrat candidate in mays london mayoral election paddick who told the leveson inquiry this week that he toned down a met report about its handling of rape on the instructions of senior officers is launching a poster and online campaign highlighting the mets poor record paddick tells the guardian when you look at the very low conviction rate when you read the testimony of rape victims who say that whilst the initial police response was good when the detectives got involved they seemed to be determined to undermine the allegation then predatory men are going to take some encouragement from that if predatory men believe that the police will try and discredit the victim then that could encourage them to commit offences of rape the former met officer warns that police often make the assumption that women are partially or totally responsible if they have been flirtatious this is not confined to the police service this is an attitude in society generally says paddick i can remember a senior officer saying to me oh yes this woman went round and started playing strip poker with this guy she subsequently claimed that shed been raped and he said well shed been asking for it you know this idea that when a woman says no she doesnt actually mean no shes not actually saying no she wants it really is something we have to address as an attitude in society as well as an attitude in the police unfortunately the two things reinforce themselves in the police the campaign by paddick who came third in the mayoral contest behind boris johnson and ken livingstone shows that he sees his year career as a former police officer as central to his appeal to voters in his guardian interview he says the riots of last august will be repeated if the police do not improve relations with britains black communities we had riots in august which if the police do not transform themselves we will have again he says the lib dems have become the whipping boys for the coalition and he will be campaigning to the left of nick clegg its quite obvious where im positioning myself and its to the left of the coalition what we are saying to londoners is this has got nothing to do with national politics we are putting forward an innovative radical liberal democrat agenda for londoners and thats what we want them to vote on paddick is making rape the centrepiece of his campaign because some of the problems about rape cases that paddick identified in his original report for the met have not been addressed the report found an increase in the number of allegations of rape but a fall in the percentage of allegations classified by police as rape during he cites the joint report this week by her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and the crown prosecution service which found that nearly of all recorded rape cases in england and wales in were officially logged as no crimes the report said a rape case should only be nocrimed if the victim states that it did not happen paddick says the police have been placing far too much emphasis on performance rather than on a victimcentred approach to rape we know that rape is a very difficult offence to secure a conviction on and the easiest way to improve your performance in terms of clearup rate is not to solve more rape cases its to write off more allegations as not having taken place or some other reason why the thing should not be recorded as a crime its much easier to improve your performance that way than it is by putting more effort and time into securing convictions paddick says police also need to widen their horizons when they are considering likely rape suspects citing the case of john worboys the licensed taxi driver jailed indefinitely in for drugging and sexually assaulting women a yearold victim told the guardian in that police laughed at her and told her she had been drunk after she alleged that worboys had raped her a report by the independent police complaints commission in highlighted individual and systemic problems within the met investigation paddick says thats a specific example of the police attributing to a category of citizen blackcab drivers an assumption of innocence if you like the worboys case proves it is not justified and it is a clear warning sign to the police that they need to take all allegations of rape very seriously no matter how incredible they might think the allegation is,2012-03,police danger

among the mass of books magazines pamphlets posters and exquisitely stitched banners that pull together the threads of the rich narrative of british womens lives over the past four centuries perhaps one of the smallest items in the womens library is the most intriguing the return portion of a train ticket from victoria station in london to epsom was among the personal effects found on emily wilding davison the yearold suffragette martyred under the hooves of george vs horse at the derby it raises the question did she really intend to die at the surrey racecourse that day theres something about the strength of that story the physicality of seeing the ticket and her tiny purse that makes it so emotional said the librarys collections manager teresa doherty it is probably the most popular item here the purse and ticket are part of the oldest and most extensive collection of womens history in europe which to use the words of the late mary stott founder editor of the guardian womens

police believe a serial date rapist who was arrested four times over a year period before being charged may have attacked other women brian witty was found guilty on tuesday of three counts of rape and one of sexual assault of women he had picked up on dating websites and in bars but campaigners have asked why it took so long for the former territorial army captain to be stopped in and the exparachute regiment members victims reported him to police within hours and he was arrested but each time he insisted the sex or contact had been consensual and the crown prosecution service cps advised against charging him it was only when his fourth victim alleged rape in august last year that the previous cases were reopened and charges brought the cps said that while its reviewing lawyer in knew about the previous allegations they could not say for certain whether that was the case in the prosecution said that failure to charge earlier had emboldened him and made him feel untouchable the group women against rape said detective inspector michael murfin of the mets sapphire unit said witty was a predatory rapist and urged anyone who believed they had been raped or assaulted by him to contact police witty was told he faced a long jail term the fiveweek trial at kingston crown court heard he switched between being charming one minute and a threatening bully the next warning one woman he had been in the forces and could do whatever he wanted even kill her when another rejected his advances and began to cry he said i dont believe this im a goodlooking bloke he then told her when you say no you mean yes witty met two of his victims on the website datingdirectcom raping one last year after she went back to his flat in teddington southwest london following a date he sexually assaulted the other in an alleyway after drinks in a covent garden bar and raped both his other victims in his flat witty could not have believed that they were consenting not while they were crying or pleading or begging him not to or telling him no again and again the prosecutor edmund gritt told the court women against rapes lisa longstaff said the trial has shown once again that with serial rapists police and cps have a serial response they believe the rapist rather than his victim and the way the investigation is handled is determined by that the fourth investigation was far better than the previous ones witnesses who had been neglected were interviewed and evidence gathered the trial heard that police did not try to contact other women witty had met on the dating site or investigate whether he had been telling the truth when he said in three of the cases that he was about to go away the head of the cps in london alison saunders rejected the claim that prosecutors believed alleged rapists over victims saying the earlier cases had not gone ahead because they had determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction she added the decisions to not charge the three previous allegations were made at a time when our specialist knowledge of the complexity of rape cases was not at the high level it is today in a statement the met

are women more careerdriven than men yes according to a new pew poll showing that in and of women compared to of men said being successful in a highpaying career or profession was one of the most important things or very important in their lives for women thats a point jump from when only put success in a highpaying career as a top priority for men the numbers are basically static years ago of men said a successful highpaying career was very important or one of the most important things mens ambitions have remained consistently high and womens have increased we should be cheering right instead the idea that women might be more ambitious incites a quiet panic at aol jobs for example claire gordon warns of the coming matriarchy before helpfully pointing out that women can always count on babies to get in the way she ends the piece by soothing men with the entirely hackneyed promise that the more success women gain in their careers the more they want to be submissive in the bedroom similar handwringing happened over at forbes but why womens ambitions havent come at the expense of men and according to the same poll both men and women place even higher values on good marriages and parenting than on their jobs parenting in particular saw a jump in importance over the past years from both male and female respondents the takeaway it seems is that young men and women both want to work hard at their careers and also want to be great moms and dads instead of showing that mens ambitions have stagnated or that women are surpassing them these pew results instead reflect financial realities for many americans and the benefits of shifting gender roles the gender wage gap though narrowing is still substantial a woman makes cents to a mans dollar for the same job and the same number of hours despite the fact that more women are now graduating from college than men more than twice as many women as men and most of them women of color work in occupations that pay poverty wages for a family of four many women are single mothers and a highpaying job means the difference between thriving and barely surviving and despite media portrayals of stayathome moms as wealthy ann romneys the reality is that women who forgo work for childrearing are more likely to be lowerincome and less educated also raising the question of how much staying at home is a choice or just happens to be more financially viable than working a lowwage job and paying for childcare for many women prioritizing a wellpaying career is a necessity since making a liveable wage doing lowskilled work isnt something we can count on but the pew poll also reflects how increases in gender equality have been better for families including men fiftynine percent of women and of men say that being a good parent is a top priority thats a point hike from what women said in and an point hike for men despite societal fingerwagging that women cant have it all women today are seeing that while balancing career and family is not easy it is entirely possible especially since modern men are much more likely to help out and we see that the familycareer balance would be a heck of a lot easier with some policy changes like family leave universal healthcare better aid to lowincome families and affordable childcare both women and men today are marrying later giving them time not only to develop more fully as human beings before choosing a partner but also to establish themselves in their jobs and achieve basic financial stability before reproducing thanks to reproductive rights including birth control and abortion social gains that american conservatives are trying to roll back children are more likely to be wanted and planned which means greater familial stability and healthier kids both men and women spend more time and more quality time with their kids than ever before even more time than at the height of the stayathome mother dads who also balance work and family mean working moms arent under quite as much pressure to be fulltime employees and overtime parents and so young women now can reasonably expect to have a fulfilling career and also be great moms and dads relieved of the burden to be the sole financial provider for their entire families can recognize that their contributions to their kids can go far beyond the monetary and include the tough but fulfilling emotional work of parenting as well the ability to plan families genderegalitarian marriages and social pressure to share in parenting together mean healthier kids more involved parents lower divorce rates and more stable families poll results like these which show that career is important and good parenting even more so reflect the fact that gender equality isnt the enemy of the family in fact its much better for women men and children than traditional gender roles theres still a long way to go especially for women in lowwage jobs the pay gap remains high and despite more male involvement in childrearing women still do the majority of childcare and household labor but were getting there and a generation of incredibly ambitious women are leading the way,2012-04,woman careerdriven men yes according new

around two years ago six ice agents entered the home of a yearold man named adam while he was sleeping they put a gun to his head and informed him they had a warrant to search his premises for child pornography adam is a musician and was a frequent user of the peertopeer filesharing website limewire which he used to download and share music videos the search of his computer hard drive yielded videos most of which were music and a small portion of which were adult porn two suspect child porn videos featuring girls aged and another video apparently featuring a three yearold had been downloaded and deleted adam claims that the downloads were accidental and that although he occasionally indulged in adult porn like many men his age he has no interest in child pornography cp never sought it out and deleted the downloaded items as soon as he realized what they were the fact that the forensic evidence showed that the items were never viewed and that there was no record of any keyword searches that would indicate he was looking for cp would seem to back up that claim but it didnt matter adam was charged with possession of child pornography and was warned by the prosecutor that if he did not plead guilty the charge would be upgraded to distribution as a filesharing site limewire is an automatic distribution tool so he would then be looking at years in a federal penitentiary seeing no way out he took a guilty plea was sentenced to months in prison years of probation and a lifetime on the sex offender registry as a native of the state of florida when adam is eventually released from prison he will be subjected to among the most severe registration rules in the country he will be required to register every time he moves failure to register or violation of any of the terms of his probation attending a family function where children are present for example or visiting a friend who has a child will result in an automatic return to prison for an indefinite period his voting rights may never be restored his chances of finding meaningful work or any kind of work are slim at best and it will be next to impossible for him to find a decent place to live residency laws for sex offenders are so restrictive that in many jurisdictions they cannot live within feet of any church school daycare center playground or bus stop these restrictions have effectively eliminated any eligible housing for sex offenders in many urban areas and as evidenced in this documentary have forced hundreds of men to live like lepers in tent dwellings in the florida swamps with no running water or electricity sex offender registries date back to the s but they did not become mandatory in all states until the s when congress began passing a series of laws such as the jacob wetterling act megans law and the adam walsh act all named for children who had been abducted molested or killed the registry was intended to prevent other children from falling victim to a similar fate a desire shared by everyone but the laws have so drastically expanded what qualifies as a sex offense there are now over americans on the registry pdf many of whom have never harmed a child and are unlikely to ever harm a child rendering it a selfdefeating tool in some states for instance public urination is enough to get you on the registry as is mooning streaking flashing or visiting a prostitute a yearold boy who has consensual sex with his yearold girlfriend can be charged with statutory rape a teenage girl who posts naked pictures of herself on any kind of filesharing site can be charged as a distributor of child pornography anyone who accesses the wrong kind of porn accidentally or otherwise as adam did will also be branded with the sex offender label in at least states that label is for life none of these categories of offenders is likely to harm a child studies have found that only of men convicted of viewing child pornography have gone on to commit a handson sex offense yet they are among the most severely punished group of offenders the money time effort and manpower required to keep such broad categories of offenders and socalled offenders under surveillance is money time effort and manpower that is being diverted from monitoring those who pose a genuine threat the argument of course is that when it comes to protecting children you cannot take any chances but there are sophisticated risk assessment tools available and in use that are far more effective means of identifying danger than making hundreds of thousands of peoples lives unliveable its easier though and politically more palatable to declare zero tolerance for sex offenders and to keep passing laws that look good on the books never mind if they are actually

mps will vote on the governments cuts to legal aid today over the last few months the house of lords has made some vital changes to the legal aid bill these changes would protect children domestic violence victims and disabled people from the worst of the legal aid cuts the government has made some concessions but now we are told all these commitments could be reversed in the house of commons there is a real danger that all this good work could go to waste mps have a very clear choice they can back the lords to stop the worst of the cuts or they can vote to stick with the governments original plans almost every day on the mumsnet forums we see heartbreaking stories from women trapped in abusive relationships or parents desperately challenging local authority decisions on provision for their children with special needs the legal aid budget helps women and families out of these situations which is why it needs protecting because those who use legal aid are some of the most vulnerable in our society currently cases of divorce and family breakdown receive legal aid if the bill is passed it is estimated this will be reduced to family mediation is provided to families and couples to prevent divorce cases going to court if the bill is passed this will be reduced to two women a week die as a result of domestic violence while another a week need to get legal aid to help them and their children escape from abusive relationships as a crime domestic violence is not restricted to one social or economic group it impacts every social group if mps vote to support the government changes womens access to legal aid will rely heavily on them having pursued their partnershusbands through the criminal courts or via injunction proceedings that many domestic abuse victims are too terrified to do where do they expect women to find the money to fight their cases while it is welcomed that the government has accepted the association of chief police officers definition of domestic violence this does not address the bigger issues of the narrow gateway criteria for obtaining legal aid in a domestic violence case only women who can prove a high risk of violence such as having secured a conviction or injunction against their perpetrator or have been referred for a risk assessment will be eligible for legal aid there is also a month time limit ie women have to make a claim within months of the reported abuse this is too short as many abusive men continue to pose a risk to their victims for a longer time period after separation has brought the abuse to an end many women dont report domestic violence until five years after it begins this is simply not good enough a survey by rights of women indicated that almost half of all victims of domestic abuse would not meet these criteria the government has said that it will only accept an undertaking from the perpetrator as sufficient evidence but not evidence from a refuge a gp or a hospital the government claims to be committed to protecting the victims of abuse but why at this stage is securing the concessions necessary to make that commitment so hard we know that today the government will argue that legal aid funding will still be available to domestic violence victims and that taxpayers are paying the worlds highest legal aid bill the fact is we do not have the most expensive legal aid system in the world for civil cases we do spend more on criminal legal aid but that is largely a quirk of the system our criminal justice system overall is about average in europe but other countries spend more on the judges and prosecute many fewer people everyone understands the dire financial state were in but should we really be targeting the most vulnerable in society surely there are better places to look for cuts than to cut the help needed to escape domestic violence i think every taxpayer would agree that spending money to help women escape domestic violence families that are in trouble and children who are abused or do not have proper education is a good thing this is not what the government bill delivers the government aims to save m annually on the budget for legal aid by implementing a series of cuts but research by kings college london found the cuts would cost at least m in unintended consequences so the savings are minimal these are the reasons why mumsnet is supporting the sound off for justice campaign and the alternatives it has provided the government today mps will be under pressure to vote with the government and they can now do it with the facts in front of them they have a

as prisons correspondent for the guardian i have covered many stories that have angered me it could hardly be otherwise writing as i am about a penal system that fails so spectacularly in so many areas but i have never been more enraged than in researching and cowriting a piece about sexual abuse in prisons the story was about perhaps the most prolific sex offender this country has ever seen neville husband was a prison officer who in was moved from portland borstal dorset to the medomsley detention centre county durham where he ran the kitchen for years it is likely that on every working day of that period he sexually abused young detainees in his charge those were young vulnerable boys many of them from the care system too terrified to complain my anger is not directed at husband who was sentenced to years in jail for his crimes and is now dead it is instead aimed at the system and those in it who at all levels protected him and betrayed his victims they are fellow officers who at husbands trial testified they knew something was going on husband used to keep one boy behind in the kitchen at night said one we always felt sorry for that boy felt sorry then why didnt you do something about it and put an end to husbands reign of terror an end to the misery his victims suffered i am also angry at the various governors at medomsley who approved husbands request to stay there when promotion and transfer beckoned angry at those who knew of his previous arrest for possession of child pornography depicting teenage boys while he was at portland husband was not charged because he was thinking about writing a book on homosexuality and the material seized was for research im angry at durham police officers who ignored the complaints of some of the victims who went to them after being released and who failed to move on him even after an accomplice of his had been arrested for abuse and told them he had been given a boy by husband my anger is also directed at people at the top of the prison service who when some victims sought compensation fought the claim all the way to the house of lords politicians like then minister of justice jack straw who said after those victims hoped the system would apologise to them that an apology was not part of the settlement really mr straw you could not say sorry to victims who in some cases were tied up and raped by an officer of the crown and lets not forget the current prison service which responded to our request for a comment on husbands abuse thus in the late s several detainees held at medomsley detention centre were physically and sexually abused by neville husband at no stage has the ministry of justice attempted to defend the actions of mr husband the prison service has come a long way since the s and significant efforts have been made to eliminate so far as is possible the mistreatment of prisoners several detainees any rational examination of the evidence against husband would conclude he abused hundreds possibly thousands of boys during his awful tenure as for not defending husbands actions fighting compensation claims all the way to the house of lords looks pretty much like defending his actions to me the prison service did not bother to send an observer to husbands trial and told the victims lawyers it had no plans to carry out a review or investigation after the civil action the crown prosecution service decided not to prosecute husband over alleged abuse at deerbolt young offenders institution because it would not be in the public interest is that moving on in order to move on from a problem it has to be first acknowledged and then addressed there still has never been an inquiry into how husband was allowed to abuse so many people over so many years and to try to ensure it never happens again as nick hardwick chief inspector of prisons told the guardian it would be dangerously complacent to imagine these things could only happen in the past there is always a danger that in closed institutions be they prisons childrens homes or hospitals abusive behaviour by some staff becomes the accepted norm we need to recognise the vulnerability inherent in the situation of every detainee we were alerted to this horror story by a powerful nobudget film adam rickwood and the medolmsley heroes produced by pie and mash films it was never broadcast but is available on youtube it is a long and angry account of the anguish caused by husband exacerbated by the system that protected him it does not make comfortable viewing those who betrayed the boys in their charge

snapshot alice my suffragette ancestor as a boy some years ago i would spend much time with my maternal grandfather during the school holidays and hear of his adventures as a young man but grandad also told me about his mother alice she was a suffragette and went to prison five times in her fight for the vote not only that but grandad told me that he would often attend the suffragette rallies with his mother as would the whole family including her husband alfred as a young boy i did not place great value on my grandfathers memories of those suffragette years but i now realise how precious they are being firsthand accounts of womens history in the making many people think of the suffragettes as welltodo middleclass ladies with time on their hands but alice hawkins was not one of these a mother of six working long hours in a leicester shoe factory she was a strong socialist yet joined forces with women of all social classes and political persuasions united in a common cause in february on the day of the state opening of parliament alice protested with other suffragettes in parliament square angry that the kings speech that day contained no news of a bill to give women the right to vote arrested for the first time at the age of alice wrote to her local mp that night from the cells of cannon row police station and complained bitterly that the mounted police had charged the women down like cossacks adding no other civilised country would deal with its women folk in such a manner this was alices first arrest but not her last in a sevenyear period leading up to the first world war we are very lucky as we still have much of alices suffragette memorabilia in the family including her sash hunger strike medal prison notes and the bail warrant issued to her at cannon row that night in i have always found alices story fascinating and was asked some seven years ago to speak to a local townswomen guild about her life never having spoken publicly before i stood up fairly nervously that evening but suddenly felt a great rush of pride and enthusiasm and even after such talks to date have never lost that feeling many people fear retirement but for me it cannot come too soon as it will allow me more time to speak publicly of alices fight for the vote i recently spoke to students at a local school and opened with the words if you want a lesson on citizenship

my names kevin raymond young and im years old theres something desperate about the way young says it as if hes clinging to the wreckage of his identity young was when he was sent to medomsley detention centre in county durham hed already had a tough life taken into care at two sexually and physically abused by those who were meant to look after him but this was something different as soon as he starts to tell his story hes in tears his experience of medomsley in has shaped or disfigured his life ever since he was convicted of receiving stolen property a watch his brother had given him the first he had owned the police asked if he knew where it had come from no he said could it possibly have been stolen they asked he thought about it well yes possibly he was sentenced to three months detention the morning after he arrived at medomsley young was lining up for breakfast when he was picked out of the queue by neville husband the officer who ran the kitchen young later discovered that husband had asked for his file he wanted to know everything about him most importantly whether he had family who were likely to visit him young was one of a handful of new inmates sent to work in the kitchen with husband there are two things that are important to successfully sexually abuse somebody young says by successful i mean without being prosecuted one anonymity or silence if you cant carry out your act without people knowing youre not going to be at it very long the second thing you need is a victim whos reliable a reliable victim is someone whos already been abused to the point where if they do speak out who on earth is going to believe them and who on earth is going to believe kevin young the paupers son who has been in and out of care whos a knifewielding thug a bully that is how a number of care home reports described young but he insists he was a quiet overobedient boy the truth is nobody would have believed me abuse might be too mild a word for what husband did to young over the next two months i was raped repeatedly tied up and ligatured around the neck it was the worst of the worst that day after young arrived husband took him to a storeroom above the kitchens that he had converted into a lounge he locked the door took out the key and stuffed the keyhole with tissues i thought i was going to be killed young says i was told by husband that you could easily be found hanged at medomsley and that that year six boys had already hanged themselves young insists there wasnt just the one man abusing him he was so sure of himself that he was able to take me out of the prison against my will and to his private house just outside the prison gates he was married with one child in his house i was blindfolded ligatured and made to lie on the stairs then three or four others raped me as well i could see them from the bottom of the blindfold a rope was put round my neck and turned till i passed out husband was an expert at it he was a big stocky powerful man perhaps the most horrifying aspect of the neville husband story is that the detention centre the prison service and the police all knew of his interest in boys in eight years before young was jailed husband was arrested at portland borstal in dorset and charged with importing pornography the material seized included sadomasochistic images involving teenage boys astonishingly the charges were dropped husband admitted showing the material to boys in his care but argued that he was interested in child pornography only because he was conducting research into homosexuality details of that arrest were written on top of his employment record and went with him throughout his career he moved to medomsley the smallest detention centre in the country where he abused boys aged between and until he was moved years later from accounts given by victims and former staff he may have abused boys every day of his tenure there dr elie godsi a former senior psychologist for the home office gave evidence in the civil action brought by young and other victims this is one of the worst cases of sexual abuse i have come across in years of working for the home office and with some of the most prolific sex offenders in the country he said today more than years since husband started abusing teenage boys more and more damaged men are coming forward to reveal how he ruined their lives some have been paid compensation but they say thats not enough they want to know how he was allowed to get away with it for so many years and why the police and colleagues in the prison system failed to notice his abuse or act on their suspicions kevin young came out of medomsley on june a day before his th birthday and went straight to consett police station the nearest to the centre i explained to the officer that id just been released from medomsley where id been subjected to a constant series of assaults by one of the officers and others i couldnt identify i showed him the marks on my neck where id been ligatured the night before i was told it was a criminal offence to make such allegations against a prison officer because i was on licence they were basically threatening to take me back to medomsley so i scattered pretty quick after that young did his best to block medomsley from his mind he tried not to think about it never told anyone about it and got on with his life after a short stint in the punk rock group the angelic upstarts he became a successful businessman owning cafes and a number of furniture stores by he says he was worth close on m and was running a security firm with his girlfriend one night they were chasing a couple of store robbers in the centre of york where young now lived when he skidded into a man of the church near york minster he was there with his full carryon his big hat and all his gear when i banged him in the chest it knocked the wind out of him and as i was falling backwards his spit was coming down on me i looked up and there he was and in that split second i was back years ago with him on top of me since leaving the prison service husband had trained and qualified as a minister the shock of seeing him after all this time sent young into meltdown he collapsed there were people lifting me up saying are you all right and my girlfriend was shouting what are you doing we need to be going theres a chase on i was just frozen i didnt know where i was how could he be so sure it was husband after all that time course i knew it was him i could taste him what does he mean he spat all over me and humiliated me he opened my mouth and spat into it time and time again young breaks down again it was horrendous off he trotted and im left in the middle of york with my girlfriend shouting what are you doing i walked off and wandered about for four hours while my radio was going where are you going where are you hes shaking and weeping and stops for a cigarette young cracked up he started to drink and became addicted to drugs spending a week on cocaine he sold the business for a third of its value to subsidise his habit lost his girlfriend lost his house lost everything once the memory hed blocked for years returned he could think of nothing else he moved into a barn in the middle of nowhere spoke to no one and gave up on life two years after he had come across husband again the police tracked down young to a bedsit he was then living in and pushed a note through the door asking if hed give evidence about abuse that had happened at st camillus a home where he had been abused before medomsley for months he ignored them but eventually he agreed to talk he told the police that what had happened at st camillus was bad but there was worse i said let me tell you a true horror story and i rattled off what had happened to me at medomsley about three weeks later a chief inspector came to my door and said weve been after neville husband for years husband had recently been the subject of complaints about abuse of boys and girls in his congregation while working as a minster at two churches in gateshead but the parents involved had not wanted to pursue the matter when his office was later raided sex aids were found in his drawers and child pornography on his computer young was taken to a safe house in york where he was shown a film on an mm projector the film showed a young boy about with a rubber thing across his head being choked and they asked me who do you think it is there again his voice breaks and he takes a few seconds to compose himself and i said i dont need to tell you who i think it is it was me so i had to sit down and watch minutes of me being hed made films of many of his victims ccccrrrrrrrr young imitates the sound of the projector when i was being assaulted i could hear that remember the old windups half my pain comes from listening to crrrrrrrrrrr youngs willingness to give evidence against husband led to his arrest it should have been a cathartic moment a vindication but it wasnt if the police had known about husband for years why had nothing been done after all they had evidence of his obsession with child pornography dating back decades and young had reported the abuse years earlier young is convinced the police had held on to the film for years without doing anything about it i believe the films and photographs were taken from the property of neville husband in he says thats the year the police raided medomsley and arrested husbands friend leslie johnson a storeman at the detention centre johnson was later convicted of abusing a young inmate mark park who he said had been given to him by husband park told police that husband had also abused him but they took no action years later at husbands trial park named several officers at medomsley who he said had made comments to him about husband abusing him and other boys a former officer at medomsley told the court staff knew something was going on between husband and the boys another former officer said husband used to keep a boy behind in the kitchen at night and we always used to feel sorry for that boy park himself was later convicted of a rape unrelated to medomsley he is now serving a life sentence husband left medomsley shortly after johnsons arrest and moved to frankland a highsecurity adult jail near durham when staff at medomsley searched his drawers and lockers they found pornographic material and sex aids husband was to continue working in the prison service for another five years he requested a move to deerbolt a young offenders institution where it is alleged he abused inmates again he eventually moved back to frankland from where he was medically discharged in on his retirement managers at frankland put him forward for the imperial service medal writing husband has served with diligence and fidelity and should be recommended for the award in husband was finally convicted of sexually abusing five young male inmates between and after pleading not guilty sentencing him to eight years in prison judge cockroft said your victims were young detainees who you chose to work for you in the kitchen so that you could abuse them there you caused them to submit to your unwelcome attentions this was a gross breach of trust you and others like you caused their damaged personalities until now they thought no one would believe them in husbands sentence was increased to years after new victims came forward and he admitted to attacks on four more boys in the crown prosecution service announced it would not be charging husband over an allegation that he went on to abuse a boy in deerbolt because it would not be in the public interest there has never been a public inquiry into medomsley despite the scale of abuse nor did the prison service hold an inquiry into how husbands abuse continued for so long james millar reid was governor at medomsley from to which covers the time when kevin young was abused at the beginning of september he was visited by detectives from durham who were investigating husband a few days after the visit he went missing and his body was found in a wood in stelling minnis near canterbury the inquest was held in february and an open verdict was returned the cause of death recorded was unascertainable as the body was badly decomposed some senior figures who worked at medomsley are reluctant to talk about their time at the detention centre tim newell a wellknown liberal thinker within the prison establishment was the governor from to when husband was regularly abusing boys in his charge according to david mcclure a former officer at medomsley who gave evidence at husbands trial newell thought very highly of husband mcclure said search teams were banned from the kitchen on the orders of management but that there were always strong rumours that husband was sexually abusing boys who were working in the kitchen there was general knowledge about this among staff and boys in the centre he said but newell and other governors wrote letters supporting husbands many applications to remain at medomsley when the prison service suggested he be promoted and posted elsewhere newell was repeatedly asked to comment on husband and medomsley for this piece but he failed to answer emails and phone calls over a period of months martin narey was director general of the prison service when husband was convicted in he had been the assistant governor at deerbolt when husband was moved there after the arrest of johnson and the assistant governor of frankland he went on to become ceo of barnardos the charity for vulnerable children why did narey never call for a public inquiry for the simple reason that at the time i knew nothing about it he says that may sound very odd with what we know now about neville husband but the first conviction which came just as i was leaving the director general post was not brought to my attention i suspect it was because at that time the magnitude of husbands offending was not known would he support a public inquiry now i have no objection to some sort of inquiry whether a public inquiry would be justified i dont know it is troubling that husband was able apparently to hide his offending over such a long period however and speaking after having had long experience of child abuse issues at barnardos i am now very aware of the ability and success of such offenders in conditioning those around them narey admits that when he was running it the prison service dealt inadequately with sexual abuse in prisons as director general i was intolerant of physical abuse and racism and sacked a lot of staff but at that time there was very little awareness of maleonmale sexual abuse either in prisons or in wider society neither narey nor newell still two of the most respected figures in prison circles has ever publicly apologised for the failure to spot husbands abuse in husband was released from prison after serving just over half his sentence a year later he died of natural causes yet the fallout from his decades of abuse continues steve whose name has been changed admits hes paranoid he has surrounded his home with seven closedcircuit television cameras and spends nearly all his time in his upstairs office where he works and monitors the cctv screens work is obtaining justice for the victims of medomsley for whom he is the liaison man it has been the cause of his life for the past years and will continue to be so until he gets somebody in authority to say sorry i could maybe then close it all down and move on steve is wearing sunglasses and when he takes them off his eyes look dead his story is familiar like young he went through a long line of childrens homes where he experienced differing degrees of abuse before ending up at medomsley again like young he stresses that abuse was nothing compared with what was to happen steve was sent to medomsley for aiding and abetting in stealing a car his cousin kevin had a stolen car picked him up in it and that was that he was according to steve husband stood out from the other officers when we first got there wed stand in line and hed look at all the new recruits laughing and joking with them trying to be your friend and have some understanding about why youre here and that hed try to ingratiate himself he picked people who had no one to visit them all the victims were from the care system husband had a shower built upstairs in the converted storeroom because he claimed the boys did not have time to wash before coming to work thats where steve was first abused he pushed us backwards into the shower then started grabbing the things he shouldnt i didnt know what to make of it or do where to go i was in prison i couldnt run away how big was steve then i was a scrawny little thing about nine and a half stone you tried to say no and it didnt make a blind bit of difference does he suspect husband abused all the kitchen boys i know he did everybody knew he was doing it nobody would say it was happening to them yet it was the talk of the place youd get comments off the officers what you been up to with husband youre one of his boys the abuse wasnt just sexual steve says i saw him crushing one guy between two gates he just kept doing it and laughing another time he put my hand in a hot pidi a metal pie dish and was pushing my hand down as he was fondling me did other officers see any of this he had a monopoly in that area you werent allowed to go in there officers had to ask him to go in when did steve leave medomsley august he says instantly he came out traumatised untrusting angry a loner he started to drink heavily unlike young he didnt report the abuse to the police on his release then in he was watching television and a report came on about abuse in a care home in sunderland steve says he flipped he was sitting with his wife with whom he had never discussed the abuse i saw it and just pppffff blew up first the coffee table went over and i was just destroying the house i even hurt my wife by accident throwing a guitar across the room i didnt know what had happened once hed calmed down he told his wife everything and they went to the police why had he never been before well if its the system doing it whats the point in going to tell the system about it there was no possible redress when i did eventually go to the police station i got the answer i expected which was we suggest you go home put it behind you because you can imagine the effect it will have on your wife and children should this get out on the estate where you live steve ignored the advice and took it to a higher police authority how did he feel after husband was convicted i cried like a baby with relief and satisfaction christ at long last yes we had done wrong yes we possibly deserved to go to a place like that but we didnt deserve what happened there has he found peace since husband went to jail no ill never be over it you only have one life and once its irreparably damaged thats it after husband was convicted came the fight for compensation for his victims the home office fought every allegation at one point steve says a doctor was brought forward in court to claim that kevin young was genetically predisposed to being abused young received to compensate for his suffering and lost fortune he reckons he spent fighting his case steve received compensation in its not about compensation its about understanding i gave it away he says until he saw the report on television he had worked in a number of jobs but he has not been employed since now he is on jobseekers allowance and a small sickness payment richard hall lives in a firstfloor flat in heaton a pleasant suburb of newcastle a quiet softly spoken man his eyes dart nervously around the room as we speak hall entered the care system aged just three weeks the son of a prostitute mother and a pimp father he was briefly placed with foster parents in before being moved from one care home to another by the time he was hall had been in homes and had suffered physical and sexual abuse in several of them he was sent to medomsley just before christmas like steve he had pleaded guilty to being carried in a stolen car and received three months detention a week later while standing in the dinner queue hall was tapped on the shoulder by husband and told you are working for me the abuse began almost immediately on one occasion husband was about to rape him when he was interrupted by the arrival of another young inmate halls friend martin wasnidge wasnidge later mocked hall about husband shame meant the two boys didnt talk to one another about what was going on in during husbands trial wasnidge hanged himself in prison he had been questioned by police as a possible victim but had denied being abused by husband hall believes the denial was because wasnidge did not want his fellow prisoners to know what had happened at medomsley hall learned of wasnidges death as he stepped out of the witness box the news left him guiltridden because he was the one who had told police wasnidge had been abused he had seen husband groping him if i hadnt done that hed still be alive hall says hall had one visitor at medomsley his sister who was also brought up in care hall told her about the abuse husband was inflicting on him a victim of abuse herself his sister advised him to say nothing nobody will believe you richard she said and you will be in bigger trouble hall took refuge in drink after he came out of medomsley he would down cans of beer in an average day now he has cut down to a dozen cans maybe four days a week on the other three days he stays in bed with the curtains drawn he says he feels empty a hollow man like steve hall seldom leaves his flat which he decorated with some of the compensation he received from the home office in november it was part of a total of the ministry of justice paid out to men hall is bitter about the settlement which took six years to negotiate when the medomsley victims first sought redress the home office used the statute of limitations to avoid payment it defended that decision in a costly legal fight that went all the way to the house of lords even when the law lords ruled in favour of the claimants the home office refused to back down and declared its intention of fighting the claim in court david greenwood of jordans solicitors in west yorkshire has dealt with all the medomsley victims cases representing abused boys so far he says that given husbands modus operandi hundreds of boys may have been abused by him greenwood estimates the costs to the home office of fighting the cases at around at the end of the hearing of youngs case in his lawyers asked the home office if it intended to carry out a review or investigation of medomsley they were told there were no plans to do so greenwood was surprised by this it is odd when a senior prison officer has sexually assaulted boys including taking them to his house to do so and other staff seem to have turned a blind eye to it and not reported finds of pornographic material that no investigation was carried out a spokesman for the ministry of justice told the guardian in the late s several detainees held at medomsley detention centre were physically and sexually abused by neville husband at no stage has the ministry of justice attempted to defend the actions of mr husband the prison service has come a long way since the s and significant efforts have been made to eliminate so far as is possible the mistreatment of prisoners the victims are appalled that they did not receive an apology steve complained to his mp stephen byers who wrote to the then justice minister jack straw straw replied the terms of the agreement did not include an apology hall says the settlement and the nature of its conclusion made him feel abused again none of the victims has been offered counselling or psychiatric help indeed the terms of their settlement stated that if such help was required the victims should pay for it out of their award today kevin young lives in a shed in a friends garden hes no longer addicted to drink or drugs but he knows hes far from healthy he says hes typical of husbands victims broken he is considering suing the police for decades they denied hed complained the day he was released but he recently received a letter acknowledging that they had in fact received a number of complaints about husbands abuse particularly during the s and s richard hall says he thinks about killing himself every day he made one serious attempt in when he swallowed two packets of prozac washed down with alcohol one of the things he finds most devastating is that there were staff at medomsley who did not act on their suspicions of husband some of them are still employed by the state others are drawing their pensions hall says do they not feel any shame martin narey former directorgeneral of the prison service doesnt know why or how those officers failed to report their concerns but says he is outraged i feel angry about them there is hardly a hairs breadth of culpability between neville husband who abused children and any of the staff who apparently knew about this and failed to take their concerns forward in my view there is a case for the police considering whether their failure to protect children amounted to aiding and abetting,2012-04,name kevin raymond young im year old something desperate way young say clinging wreckage identity

the former directorgeneral of the prison service martin narey has admitted that the service dealt inadequately with sexual abuse during his tenure following a guardian investigation into the sexual abuse of young offenders by prison officer neville husband narey who worked with husband and was directorgeneral from to admitted to the guardian as directorgeneral i was intolerant of physical abuse and racism and sacked a lot of staff but at that time there was very little awareness of maleonmale sexual abuse either in prisons or in wider society husband who ran the kitchen at medomsley detention centre in county durham is know to have sexually abused teenage boys between and when the prison service suggested that he be promoted to a different establishment governors wrote letters supporting his applications to remain at medomsley when he was finally moved to deerbolt young offenders institution another allegation of sex abuse was made husband left the prison service in and went on to run two churches in gateshead where children in his congregation also complained of abuse though parents did not pursue the matter he was eventually convicted in of sexually abusing five young inmates at medomsley and sentenced to eight years he died a year after his release in the guardian investigation has found that victims have so far come forward it is estimated that husband abused hundreds of young offenders during his years in the prison service shockingly husbands interest in young boys was known as far back as years before he was convicted when he was arrested at portland borstal dorset and charged with the importation of pornography from europe the material seized included sadomasochistic images involving teenage boys husband admitted showing the material to boys in his care but the charges were dropped when he said he was conducting research into homosexuality at husbands trial prison officers admitted there was general knowledge among staff about husbands sexual abuse but that they did nothing about it speaking in todays weekend magazine the former medomsley boys now men in their s talk about husbands impact on their life kevin young became addicted to drink and drugs richard hall attempted suicide and says he still thinks about killing himself every day young went to report his abuse the day he left medomsley but he said police told him not to pursue the complaint unless he wanted to be returned to the detention centre until recently durham police denied that he had made a statement on his release but they now admit that a number of complaints were made by former inmates particularly in the s and s victims now say they are considering suing the police narey who went on to be chief executive of barnardos the charity for vulnerable children believes that the officers who had failed to report their suspicions should be investigated there is hardly a hairsbreadth of culpability between neville husband who abused children and any of the staff who apparently knew about this and failed to take their concerns forward in my view there is a case for the police considering whether their failure to protect children amounted to aiding and abetting nick hardwick chief inspector of prisons said it would be dangerously complacent to imagine these things could only happen in the past there is always a danger that in closed institutions be they prisons childrens homes or hospitals abusive behaviour by some staff becomes the accepted norm we need to recognise the vulnerability inherent in the situation of every detainee david ramsbottom the former chief inspector of prisons said in light of what is described it is essential that the authorities review current procedures to satisfy themselves that every practical measure is being taken to try to ensure that such abuses cannot happen in any establishment containing young people it has everything to gain and nothing to lose from a public inquiry because it can be seen to have been telling the truth which will increase trust in it if it refuses to conduct affairs openly it has only itself to blame if its word is not believed but time is the enemy here it would have been so much better had the inquiry been conducted or more years ago when the medomsley victims sought compensation after husbands conviction the home office used the statute of limitations to avoid payment eventually in it paid out to men but cases are still being settled when asked whether it still had the records from medomsley which was shut down in the ministry of justice told the guardian there is ongoing civil litigation concerning the establishment so it would be inappropriate at this stage to comment on what evidence is or is not available the victims of medomsley have never received an apology for the abuse they suffered in care when stephen byers then mp for some of the victims wrote to the then justice minister jack straw in straw replied the terms of the agreement did not include an apology,2012-04,former directorgeneral prison service martin narey ha admitted service dealt inadequately sexual abuse tenure following guardian investigation sexual abuse young

asking the mayoral candidates what they are going to do about violence against women and girls is a big and important question not only are we half the population each and every one of us is united in the reality or fear of violence from men so the end violence against women coalition was spot on to host an event to explore this crucial issue that affects every single one of the four million women and girls in london which is why it was a shame that none of them could be bothered to turn up but sent substitutes instead it would appear that the actual candidates favoured the other two hustings being held yesterday evening one on issues affecting black and minority ethnic londoners and another on disability rights women appear to count only in a minority kit malthouse conservative val shawcross labour caroline pidgeon lib dem and natalie bennett green were there to answer questions of an audience made up mainly of women working in antisexualviolence services livingstone and johnson have recently published crime manifestos that contain some interesting differences between their policies on violence against women for example johnsons manifesto highlights womens safety includes clear pledges on female genital mutilation and other forms of honourbased violence and promises to improve work around domestic violence livingstone pledges to tackle sexual harassment and violence towards girls from gang members but interestingly excludes any mention of socalled honour crimes the event was low key to the point of dull with all of the candidates being polite and a bit muted malthouse was by far the most convincing had i not been informed of which party they all represented i would have put my cross against his name there were lots of i agree with kit moments from the panel until he made a gaffe and said there are too many womens groups in london doing the same thing and suggested that domestic violence refuges could be run more cheaply by generic social housing providers things went downhill fast for malthouse from then on with him muting a daft idea of the tories about tackling domestic violence rather than kick them out of the home stop them from boozing and test them for alcohol twice a day alcohol plays a part in domestic violence we want to pilot a scheme where offenders abstain from alcohol as part of the penalty he then suggested that the mayor has made it easier for women to join the metropolitan police by increasing the numbers of special constables from to so they can try it out parttime and on a voluntary basis i was nodding off at this stage and wondered if i had woken up in the s shawcross mainly trotted out the same old platitudes and like the others seemed to suggest that women can be made safer if there is better street lighting staffed train and tube stations and buses that drop women at the top of their road the fact that men rape women rather than street lighting was not mentioned by anyone the issue of forced marriage raised by the feminist academic aisha gill who made it clear that she is against criminalisation created a bit of a stir the entire panel disagreed with her it was a depressing moment for me when so many women in the audience started murmuring no when the panel spoke of why it should be a specific criminal offence bennett got the only laugh of the evening when she outlined the greens anticuts manifesto we would make no cuts except for trident missiles and the war in iraq she also caused a little controversy just in time to stop me falling asleep by saying that her party supports the full decriminalisation of sex work because it keeps women safe the other panellists all disagreed with her which is interesting since it is also the policy of the lib dems but the weirdest moment came when she argued that deaths on the road are an issue of violence against women traffic smoothing makes it better for cars and worse for pedestrians and cyclists most people killed on the road are women she said causing puzzled looks all around pidgeon simply churned out clichs and platitudes the audience reacted with groans not least from vera baird sitting next to me when she mentioned the unpopular lynne featherstone in a favourable manner eliciting groans of despair but otherwise she was unmemorable and unimpressive a comment on facebook this morning made me worry that feminists working in violence against women services may end up forgetting our core values as leftists we were at the mayoral elections hustings event last night where it was announced that all of the london mayoral candidates pledge to continue part funding all of the rape crisis centres in london got to say though only boriss camp seemed to have any idea about how to embed core funding within our local authorities so that we can start planning for the future truth is if the tories are given a massive shot in the arm by winning this election it will mean the destruction of womens services across the

six people have been arrested by police in leicester as part of an investigation into allegations of forced prostitution and people trafficking four men aged between and and two women aged and were detained by leicestershire police during raids that were carried out at two addresses in the city after members of the public raised concerns four women who were at the addresses in lyme road and new parks road were receiving support from specialist officers and helping police with their inquiries according to a police spokesman detective inspector simon preston the officer leading the investigation said todays arrests were a real success and i hope they reassure members of the public that we are committed to protecting those vulnerable members of our society and also targeting organised crime offences like this dont regularly occur in leicester but that doesnt mean that we are any less dedicated to targeting those we are aware of we have carried out two warrants like this in the past two months and hope it will act as a warning to anyone involved in such crimes he added it was as a result of their calls that we made the arrests and located the four women who are now being spoken to and supported by specialist officers in london some groups working with victims of trafficking have recently spoken of an increase in raids and brothel closures in olympic boroughs ahead of the games and a report last month accused police of a heavy handed approach to brothel raids in the city and of failing to find victims of trafficking the metropolitan police has said that its specialist scd unit which focuses on human exploitation and organised crime has had significant success in terms of locating people who have been trafficked and forced into prostitution although the force has not seen any evidence of an increase in trafficking of sex workers so far in olympic host boroughs,2012-04,six people arrested police leicester part investigation allegation forced prostitution people trafficking four men aged two woman aged detained leicestershire police raid carried two address city member public raised concern four woman address lyme road new park road receiving support specialist officer helping police inquiry according police spokesman detective inspector simon preston officer leading investigation said today arrest real success hope reassure member public committed protecting vulnerable member society also targeting organised crime offence like dont regularly occur leicester doesnt mean less dedicated targeting aware carried two warrant like past two month hope act warning anyone involved crime added wa result call made arrest located four woman spoken supported specialist officer london group working victim trafficking recently spoken increase raid brothel closure olympic borough ahead game report last month accused police heavy handed approach brothel raid city failing find victim trafficking metropolitan police ha said specialist scd unit focus human exploitation organised crime ha significant success term locating people trafficked forced prostitution although force ha seen evidence increase trafficking sex worker far olympic host borough,"['six', 'people', 'arrested', 'police', 'leicester', 'part', 'investigation', 'allegation', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'people', 'trafficking', 'four', 'men', 'aged', 'two', 'woman', 'aged', 'detained', 'leicestershire', 'police', 'raid', 'carried', 'two', 'address', 'city', 'member', 'public', 'raised', 'concern', 'four', 'woman', 'address', 'lyme', 'road', 'new', 'park', 'road', 'receiving', 'support', 'specialist', 'officer', 'helping', 'police', 'inquiry', 'according', 'police', 'spokesman', 'detective', 'inspector', 'simon', 'preston', 'officer', 'leading', 'investigation', 'said', 'today', 'arrest', 'real', 'success', 'hope', 'reassure', 'member', 'public', 'committed', 'protecting', 'vulnerable', 'member', 'society', 'also', 'targeting', 'organised', 'crime', 'offence', 'like', 'dont', 'regularly', 'occur', 'leicester', 'doesnt', 'mean', 'less', 'dedicated', 'targeting', 'aware', 'carried', 'two', 'warrant', 'like', 'past', 'two', 'month', 'hope', 'act', 'warning', 'anyone', 'involved', 'crime', 'added', 'wa', 'result', 'call', 'made', 'arrest', 'located', 'four', 'woman', 'spoken', 'supported', 'specialist', 'officer', 'london', 'group', 'working', 'victim', 'trafficking', 'recently', 'spoken', 'increase', 'raid', 'brothel', 'closure', 'olympic', 'borough', 'ahead', 'game', 'report', 'last', 'month', 'accused', 'police', 'heavy', 'handed', 'approach', 'brothel', 'raid', 'city', 'failing', 'find', 'victim', 'trafficking', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'ha', 'said', 'specialist', 'scd', 'unit', 'focus', 'human', 'exploitation', 'organised', 'crime', 'ha', 'significant', 'success', 'term', 'locating', 'people', 'trafficked', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'although', 'force', 'ha', 'seen', 'evidence', 'increase', 'trafficking', 'sex', 'worker', 'far', 'olympic', 'host', 'borough']",16
just over a year ago the charity protection against stalking pas and napo the probation and family court union launched a campaign to raise awareness of the consequences of the stalking of women who would have thought that by april stalking involving the fear of violence and psychological harm would become an offence on the statute book how did we do it the two organisations first met at an association of chief police officers meeting which was reviewing stalking and harassment law and training it was clear that the law was inadequate the training of professionals was at best piecemeal and victims advocacy was nonexistent it was evident too that existing legislation passed in the protection from harassment act was no longer fit for purpose a decision was taken to raise awareness in westminster an early day motion was tabled calling for stalking law reform and for the first ever national stalking awareness week the campaign then set up an independent parliamentary inquiry and invited elfyn llwyd mp chair of the justice unions parliamentary group to chair it pas and napo acted as advisers to the inquiry helping to draft its terms of reference we approached mps and peers across parties to sit on the inquiry and victims including mothers whose daughters had been killed by stalkers academics lawyers and frontline police and probation officers to give evidence the inquiry heard about campaigns of intimidation and fear many of which had lasted for years in all cases the response of the criminal justice authorities was at best haphazard and at worse indifferent by the time of the launch in february in the house of lords of the inquirys final report which we compiled alongside a draft stalking bill more than mps and peers had been recruited to the cause along with organisations from the police federation to the magistrates association at the same time as our campaign the protection of freedoms bill was going through parliament at a labour peers request we added amendments that created a stalking offence and made it a criminal offence as well as a civil one on international womens day march the prime minister announced support for law reform but the following day the government published its own amendments to the bill which limited the definition of stalking to a fear of violence there was no mention of psychological harm there followed hours of negotiation and lobbying after which the government agreed to include a clause on fear and anxiety and psychological harm the bill will become law on april after which there will be a sixmonth period of consultation on training and sentencing guidelines in november the new law will become operational our success was achieved in a remarkably short time the key was allparty support for the independent inquiry where victims voices were heard and frontline practitioners were taken seriously a wide range of organisations backing the campaign the individual lobbying of mps and peers and support of political parties it was timeconsuming and intense with more than detailed briefings and dozens of press releases produced but it worked but the job is not yet finished the physical violence and psychological harm caused by stalkers remains unacceptable the priority now is obtaining funding for a victims advocacy scheme harry fletcher is assistant general secretary of napo and

like a prehistoric creature trapped in amber the refusal by the us masters golf club augusta national to offer its traditional honorary membership to the chief executive of ibm one of the tournaments main sponsors is a freezeframe of a moment in the long cold war against discrimination gina rometty is excluded because she is a woman plenty of people would wonder why anyone would want to join a club which traditionally demanded that all caddies were black while simultaneously banning black people from membership ms rometty may be among them although she is said to play golf ibm senior executives are as anonymous as their products it is reported that her preferred sport is scuba diving she was pictured watching the masters but to the irritation of antidiscrimination campaigners neither she nor her company have been prepared to comment on let alone protest about the clubs refusal to award her the members green jacket ibm has a good reputation for promoting diversity in it supported a campaign against augustas ban on women members it actually pulled out of the masters as part of a successful campaign against the bar on black membership but this time it seems america isnt ready to get angry neither president obama nor his probable presidential rival mitt romney have done more than let it be known they think the club is wrong there was no demonstration at the club gates and the uk financial times seems to have given the issue more coverage than most us newspapers maybe there are enough women corporate chiefs now including hp xerox and pepsi for them to have their own networks and its augusta that is blindly heading for irrelevance it is true that while the us may not quite be the promised land there are enough senior women in business and banking for there even to be a serious candidate janet yellen to succeed ben bernanke at the fed its gone a lot further than most of europe against this background the membership policies of one golf club might appear to be nothing more than an obsolete curiosity but while the womanled ibm remains silent the real danger is that everything has changed so that everything can remain the same and if that is true in the us it is also true in britain some women do have new opportunities but only if they dont cause more than a benign ripple on the surface of the pond as we report elsewhere feminism is reviving young people provoked by the disproportionate impact of cuts and the rise of porn culture are exploiting social media to spread the word augusta should be a reminder that it will take collective

why are we still so fascinated by female foreign reporters veteran overseas correspondent ann leslie and channel newss international editor lindsey hilsum meet to discuss this and the future of foreign news while emine saner listens in lindsey hilsum when did you start didnt you report on the dawn of time ann leslie laughs fortyfive years ago in my day there were very few women foreign correspondents there was martha gellhorn but she was one of those women who couldnt stand other women particularly ones who she felt were muscling in on her territory that was normal then i had more trouble with other women journalists than men apart from when the men were chasing me around the furniture lh thats not my experience at all ive found my female colleagues marie colvin lyse doucet and others are my best friends we help each other even when we work for competing networks al my first foreign job was in british guiana as it was then i made a mess of it and the blokes on the foreign desk said see the girlies cant hack it but we have great advantages being women because women who are often the main victims of war will talk freely to another woman particularly in the middle east lh in iran in after the elections when there were protests on the streets we were under hotel arrest but once i put on that coat and headscarf i looked just like a middleaged iranian woman and i could move around anonymously al there is an advantage in being able to play different roles i would carry photos of my young daughter around and then when i was older i would say she was my granddaughter and you immediately get into conversations about family life even at checkpoints lh yes you can defuse tension what amazes me is there is still so much fuss made about women foreign correspondents when you started it was a novelty but now we are all over the place al if you have children some people think you are an unnatural woman and mother its still deep in the psyche i have a very supportive husband weve been married for years but he had a fulltime job which meant we had to hire nannies it is difficult if you have children i always did feel guilty i never did much war reporting partly because i had a sprog at home lh i know lots of male journalists with children who get that feeling as well and theyre never asked about their families emine saner there has been increased focus on sexual assaults on women foreign correspondents al have you been threatened with rape lh no al i was it was in the s he was palestinian i got to know him and his wife and children i was so livid because he was a friend i thought he had a knife and i have scars on my back lh it is an issue due to sexual assaults on women during the arab spring but theres also a danger men can be sexually assaulted it has been hard enough for us as women to get male editors to send us to these countries so we have to be careful with special pleading most of the dangers for female journalists are just the same for men the rocket that killed marie colvin the sunday times journalist who died in syria in february had nothing to do with her gender es is it more dangerous to be a western journalist now lh yes now every guerrilla commander or dictator is sitting there with a bank of satellite televisions and they all know what we are reporting and saying they know we are uncovering the evil things they are doing before you could go in and talk to someone and they really didnt have a clue what you were going to say now they know and they google you beforehand that means we have become targets sometimes and thats also why sometimes people wont speak to us al i was never like you or marie i was never a war correspondent did you ever feel yourself becoming a war junkie lh no im not a war junkie at all i always think im a coward and other people are much braver than me you worked for the daily mail but you were doing serious stuff the paper carried so much more serious foreign news then al all my guardianista friends say how can you work for that newspaper but would the guardian run a twopart series on azerbaijan no lh the daily mail wouldnt run it now what i worry about is shorter attention spans people pick up a bit of news here and there and if youre trying to do something that has any meaning its hard to do that in words al i dont imagine the mail would run it now but this is because the competition from celeb stuff is so much more and its expensive sending people abroad lh at channel news were quite lucky because it prides itself on its foreign news if theres a big story theres never any question about budgets but the problem is whether to fund the middlelevel story last year raised the bar so high that its hard to get any story on that isnt enormous because everyone worries about spending the budget ahead of time es does pressure on budgets mean relying more on twitter and local bloggers rather than sending journalists al you must be there filtering to some extent you have to sort of smell a place theres almost a kind of sexual excitement when you land in a new place you feel something you dont feel it if you read google and a lot of people who write about foreign affairs have never been there probably orpington is the most exotic place theyve ever been to lh there are many local eyewitnesses in places like homs but the problem is distinguishing between activists and objective observers in tv we use a lot of video that comes in but weve learned complex ways of verifying whether its checking the weather or knowing exactly who sent it thats almost like a new kind of journalism being able to read stuff from citizen journalists al but its not what you and i went into the business to do lh i didnt but one of the best things is that people from these countries who couldnt report because of repression are the ones pushing back the boundaries i met this young jordanian woman who did an investigation into corruption and another woman from gaza who had got an article on rape within the family into the hamas newspaper how fantastic is that the idea that foreign reporting is just a white bloke or woman going to report on the behaviour of the natives has gone and thats good al when i started people were longing to get their stories out and the only way to do that was to talk to people like me now they can get their views out without us lindsey hilsums book sandstorm libya in the time of revolution is available in the guardian bookshop ann leslies memoir is killing my own snakes pan macmillan,2012-04,still fascinated

on monday the media were allowed to name the teenager daniel bartlam who bludgeoned his mother jacqueline to death with a hammer last year at the age of years such acts are assumed to be uncommon but occurrences are more frequent than we might think in the united states where guns are more widely available a parent is killed by their own child almost every day research suggests that children who commit this act fall into one of three categories the severely mentally ill child the dangerously antisocial child and by far the most common in over of cases according to one study the severely abused child who is pushed beyond his or her limits i have heard nothing to suggest that daniel bartlams upbringing was anything other than ordinarily loving however having heard many shocking tales of parental abuse my puzzlement is not so much why children murder their parents but why more of these murders arent committed in my experience abused children feel safer if they believe the reason for the parents behaviour is not that the parent is bad but that the children themselves are at fault and the bad things would not keep happening if only they could learn to get their own behaviour right i would also add that the great majority of parents who abuse were abused themselves and survived by playing that same game and so abuse and its effects are unwittingly passed down through the generations of course while many children experience such abuse only a relatively few escape it via murdering a parent so what do these more extreme cases have in common they are usually isolated and have no one willing to listen to them and take them seriously without a sympathetic adult witness in their life they feel trapped as if they have no other choice i have been asked how i would treat a child who had committed parricide such a patient would probably need the fulltime support of a mental health team but treatment would depend on the individual my beliefs are that people adapt to their environments and to do so they find some pretty creative ways of surviving in the short term i would be looking at widening choices about those ways of surviving in the longer term i would want to provide trusting relationships so that pathways for optimism empathy and ways of selfsoothing can be formed this would be pretty difficult as early influences tend to be the most lingering but the brain retains some plasticity so that there is always hope that our mind can be positively influenced however prevention is better than a cure at antenatal classes less time could be spent teaching parentstobe how to cope with labour and birth which are over swiftly and more time on parenting skills that will have repercussions for a lifetime we need to teach the basics of how children form a relationship and how to make that relationship as rewarding as possible for the child and for the parents john bowlbys research into how children can become secure well adjusted people or not needs to be known not just by psychologists but by all of us especially parentstobe it is probably more relevant to a successful life than many subjects that are presently offered in schools and by teaching attachment theory and child development we would be giving society as a whole a better chance of avoiding child abuse and its consequences as well as continuing support for parents all children need a safe support network so that they never need feel isolated we need to teach children to recognise what abuse is because as it is probably all they have ever known they will not recognise it as anything other than the norm we could be doing more to support parents and support children it takes a village to bring up a child and if such communities are less common we need to strengthen other networks to take their place to end the isolation that can end in tragedy follow comment is free on twitter commentisfree,2012-04,monday medium allowed name teenager daniel bartlam bludgeoned mother

what kind of career trajectory do you need to caption a photograph of a topless sienna miller wearing birds i ask because on sunday alexandra shulman the editor of british vogue expressed an opinion on women in the workplace the reality is she told the observer if you take time out and have children it does damage your trajectory in some way i know it shouldnt i know there should be a way round it but i think its really hard effectively youre sort of out really for two or three years and that does make a difference you cant pretend it doesnt so there it is from one of the most senior women in british journalism a sleepy acceptance cut with an idle regret she said much the same thing about the pay gap which kind of interests her we ought to get paid absolutely equally for the work that we do she said i dont think women are so good at fighting their corner as men or maybe they arent as good at having influential women acknowledge that someone has to have children and that children and employment should not be incompatible shulman added that her infant son had disliked her working full time which makes me wonder if he attended prebudget meetings and was listened to i hate that magazine he would tell her that makes two of us kid i will type until my fingers bleed these are the worst of times for women and the best of times for inequality which is not a buzzword to be mocked but a phenomenon that is paid for in human tears at a tuc event last month we lamented we are going backwards women are leaving the workforce in ever greater numbers to meet the usual fate of women who dont work in a shrinking state divesting itself even of free access to the child support agency and legal aid poverty and indifference to poverty when the current vogue for retro style rolled in cupcakes and mad men and julian fellowess reactionary fantasies i thought it was a trend i didnt realise it was a prophecy hung with other assaults on womens needs such as protesters standing like righteous zombies outside british abortion clinics be pregnant is their message be grateful the truth is an irrelevance here women do not plead for special treatment begging to enter the workplace so they can buy pretty things it is established wisdom that working women benefit the economy their families and themselves just last week it emerged that depression is more widespread in nonworking women and in the longhours macho working culture that thrills business because it enables mens psychological dominance what is the cost to them even the prime minister acknowledges the benefit of working women as he legislates to make them unemployed in that strange childish way he has of wishing for something with one hand and demolishing it with the other which brings to mind the rage of shulmans tiny son if we fail to unlock the potential of women in the labour market he said were not only failing those individuals were failing our whole economy he said it and forgot it because the budget came bn more in cuts so some facts that wont make it into vogue with or without topless actresses and birds this is a perfect storm of growing inequality last month there were million unemployed women in britain a increase since and the highest figure for years in the same period male unemployment has risen by a mere according to data collected by the fawcett society in the last quarter of those losing their jobs were women in some local councils of those fired were female and as ever the poorest are hit most black and minority ethnic women and those in the northeast are the first to go and in the greatest numbers many women are leaving work due to the cuts in child tax credit and child benefit unable to pay for childcare they cannot afford to work which is senseless and destructive and will keep alive the dogma that women should not work into the next generation and beyond a survey conducted by the charity working mums last year found that of mothers have left employment and have reduced their hours to care for their children this is regressive poverty in poverty depression into depression these cuts should be overturned but how to pay with the tax rate a historical anomaly who knows or cares a strategy for womens employment is necessary encompassing womens security in the workplace decent provision of childcare and the scandal of occupational and gender segregation which together bring forth the pay gap the private sector will boom says the government and employ some of these women although it doesnt have the nerve to promise more well maybe was it emma harrison the jobs tsar now tarnished who said there are always jobs adding as is customary the scent of blame to the welfare claimant if they are lucky women can look forward to their time

a yearold schoolboy who raped and sexually assaulted a younger girl after viewing hardcore pornography on the internet has been spared a custodial sentence a judge was told that the boy who is now aged was emulating with the nineyearold victim adult acts he had seen following unfettered access on a computer to explicit websites the high court in edinburgh heard that the case could be the tip of the iceberg and many others may not have been identified or reported the boys defence counsel sean templeton said there is a real risk that young people of the current generation of teenagers are growing up with a skewed view of what sex is and sexual activity he said it was a great concern that they may be getting their sex education through pornographers he revealed that during a police interview the accused child was asked why he had done it and his answer was temptation when questioned about the temptation he responded to feel grown up this was an emulation of an adult act witnessed by him at this young age said the defence counsel he was afforded unfettered access to the internet and it has become apparent from a very young age the age of he was accessing hardcore pornography he said it appeared such material was discussed in the first year at secondary school and parliament was currently discussing how to protect young people from getting access to such images this is the tip of the iceberg many many cases throughout the country may not be identified not reported not coming to anyones attention said the defence counsel templeton said the boy had identified the websites he visited to police and his lawyers had carried out an investigation the behaviour witnessed was reminiscent of the acts carried out by him he added the judge lady smith told the teenager that having looked at detailed and thoughtful reports prepared in his case she could consider a noncustodial disposal and was going to send the case to the childrens panel where he could be kept under continuing supervision the judge said the measure of control and supervision that would be provided could mark societys disapproval and he would be provided with structure and advice including how to handle relationships and sexual development all of which would be in the public interest and his own she told the boy he must behave and that he was being given an opportunity to make something of yourself to put his mistakes behind him and accept the wrongdoing and to think carefully of what it was like for the girl and what she is living with because of that wrongdoing the judge told him you should not and must not regard pornography as any guide at all as to how to behave sexually you should not have engaged in sexual activity of any sort with a nineyearold girl or indeed any other young girl who under our law is not able to consent to it said smith the judge pointed out that he had pleaded guilty to statutory offences under the sexual offences scotland act she said that while the behaviour was very wrong and needed to be addressed she would venture to suggest that prior to that legislation coming into force it would not have brought him to the high court and there seemed every chance that it would have been addressed at a childrens hearing the boy who cannot be identified for legal reasons had earlier admitted statutory offences of rape and sexual assault

three polish women have admitted in a belfast court to running brothels and providing property for criminal purposes the trio appeared following the biggest ever crossborder operation against organised prostitution in ireland but a group representing some women working in the sex industry in ireland warned that the garda sochnapolice service of northern ireland operation failed to distinguish between women trafficked into prostitution and voluntary sex workers on wednesday milena halina tarnowska sandra polewska and marta kozakowska appeared at belfast magistrates court the three share an address in alfred street in the city centre a prosecution lawyer admitted in court that there was no allegation of human trafficking and no other people were involved in running the brothel apart from the accused all three women pleaded guilty to the charges kozakowska admitted a third offence of obstructing police by swallowing a mobile phone sim card when officers entered their flat the district judge imposed a twomonth prison sentence on each defendant but suspended it for months defence lawyers said all three women were planning to leave northern ireland it would be accepted by the prosecution that this was a very simple unsophisticated setup involving these three ladies one of the lawyers told the court nobody else received any money from the girls as a result of their activities there is no suggestion that anybody is in charge the two other women were arrested in northern ireland during the searches as part of operation quest they have been released on bail pending further inquiries on tuesday officers from the psni and from the garda were involved in raids on properties in northern ireland and the republic the psni said they had identified at least properties that were being used as brothels a large amount of documents cash mobile phones and computers were seized in the raids but the sex workers alliance of ireland group on wednesday questioned the efficacy of the police operation saying swai acknowledges the need to investigate trafficking and other forms of exploitation but are concerned with the indiscriminate nature of the raids it appears that there was no attempt to distinguish between voluntaryindependent workers and those controlled by others and that the garda and psni simply raided all known premises the group also warned that such a major drive against the sex trade could push more women into more dangerous situations this may lead sex workers to take greater risks with their safety in order to avoid detection particularly migrants who are working here without permission international evidence shows that indiscriminate raids of this sort involve a high cost to sex workers with very little return in terms of either arrests of traffickers or rescues of those genuinely in need it said despite these criticisms a senior psni commander stressed that operation quest would continue detective superintendent philip marshall said the operation is continuing and there is the potential for more searches and more arrests in the days ahead this operation is focused on gathering information and intelligence and evidence on the extent of the problem of organised prostitution in ireland we then have an assessment and then we will target in the future what we suspect is a number of crime gangs who were involved

ireland the women who are aged and will appear alongside another yearold woman who has been charged with obstructing the police two other women whom the police service of northern ireland arrested in tuesdays operation have been released on bail pending further inquiries eight people in total were arrested as part of the joint investigation carried out by the garda sochna in the south and the psni in the north searches were carried out at more than houses apartments and flats on both sides of the border some of the premises were being used as brothels the police said the psni said three suspected victims of human trafficking have been rescued and taken to places of safety garda said the operation was crossborder because prostitution operates on a crossborder basis and victims of trafficking and prostitution are regularly moved around brothels in both jurisdictions psni detective superintendent philip marshall said we are determined to do something about this problem it is not something society should stand for it is a criminal offence and police do take it seriously he said wednesdays events demonstrated the commitment of the psni garda and other law enforcement agencies across europe the operation south of the border which involved more than officers was led by members of the organised crime unit based at the national bureau of criminal investigation supported by officers from all regions a man in his s and a woman in her s are being questioned at dundrum garda station and a woman in her s is being held in store street garda station a garda spokesman said during the investigation to date it has been established that prostitution is organised on a crossborder basis and todays joint operation was specifically aimed at individuals and groups intent on making profits from vulnerable members of society across the island of ireland the policy of an garda sochna is to treat women involved as witnessesvictims unless significant evidence comes to light

the judge who last week sentenced elliot turner to a minimum of years for the murder of his girlfriend emily longley had this to say loving someone is not telling them they are a whore it is not trying to control them it is not threatening them you did not love her she was just a trophy the references to control and repeated instances of abuse made during the case were familiar to those who have worked in the field of violence against women however the government definition of domestic violence would not recognise emily as a victim of domestic abuse she was too young the definition states that both the victim and the perpetrator need to be adults turner was aged emily was still a child some may wonder why this matters emily was a victim of a murder and her killer was convicted why does the context of that murder make a difference if we are to prevent the loss of other young lives we need to accurately understand and then respond to abusive relationships that children and young people find themselves in the restrictions of the definition mean that services designed to support women in violent relationships such as independent domestic violence advocates multiagency risk assessment conferences and refuge provision would not have been made available to emily should she have sought help some local authorities have tried to address this gap by reducing the age at which people can access their services to but there is no consistency across the country plus unders may not qualify for high enough housing benefit to stay in a refuge which could prevent them from seeking somewhere safe to go the government has sought to recognise the inconsistencies and earlier this year launched a consultation on the definition of domestic abuse asking whether the definition should be extended to and yearolds or to all young people the results of the consultation are expected imminently but it would be wrong to believe that a change of definition alone would be enough to protect young people from domestic abuse ultimately and yearolds are still children and as such have a right to be protected from violence and abuse adult services such as refuge provision are not necessarily appropriate for younger women and when their partners are significantly older than them and yearolds could be sexually exploited children rather than children experiencing domestic violence so while we shouldnt get bogged down with semantics how we describe abuse has an impact on the services a child receives child sexual exploitation services are different from domestic abuse services each youngster needs to be considered on a casebycase basis turners conviction came in the same week as an international rescue committee report said domestic violence was the single biggest threat to women in liberia sierra leone and ivory coast in these countries it said action is required to recognise domestic violence in legislation stating that it is the most urgent pervasive and significant protection issue for women in west africa while the uk has legislative recognition of domestic violence for women public perception and universal practice are yet to consistently

lindsay sandiford the yearold british woman arrested in bali this week on charges of smuggling cocaine has reportedly claimed that she carried out the operation because her children were threatened would such a threat act as a defence to a drug smuggling charge in britain the recent referral by the criminal cases review commission of a similar case should help to clarify whether such a defence is recognised by the courts goldie coats was convicted in november of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on the importation of goods or in other words drugsmuggling she and her codefendant aaron blackstock were stopped by customs officers at heathrow the previous year on a return flight from jamaica their luggage contained kg of per cent pure cocaine with an estimated street value of blackstock pleaded guilty and was jailed for six years however coats pleaded not guilty she claimed at her trial that she had no idea that the suitcases contained drugs this defence was not accepted and she was convicted and jailed for ten years she was initially refused leave to appeal against her sentence and did not at the time seek to appeal against her conviction she

that ms coats was suffering from battered woman syndrome at the time of the offence raises the real possibility that the court of appeal will quash the conviction or reduce the sentence the case will

a victim of a serial rapist who was jailed indefinitely on friday has told how she was so scared he would strike again after police initially released him without charge that for a year she slept in her bathroom her only room she could lock the woman miss c said she considered suicide after being told there was not enough evidence to prosecute brian witty a banker and former territorial army captain she became depressed and lost her job and has hardly worked since witty was convicted in april of three rapes including that of miss c and one sexual assault on four women between and on friday yesterday he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for the rape to run concurrently with three separate indeterminate sentences for the other offences he will have to serve at least eight years before being considered for release the exparachute regiment member who met two of his victims through a dating website and the others in bars told one victim who rejected him i dont believe this im a goodlooking bloke judge nicholas price qc sentencing witty at kingston crown court southwest london told him each of your victims described in chilling evidence how you went from being plausible and caring into a bullying selfobsessed arrogant sexual predator who was determined to indulge in fulfilling your desires irrespective and dismissive of their pleas that you should desist witty was arrested and interviewed after the rape at his home address in again after a sexual assault in and after raping miss c in but charges were not brought by the crown prosecution service until after another rape sentencing witty judge price said the lack of action from the cps had led witty to believe he was untouchable price said with the benefit of hindsight it is perhaps too easy to say that had you been successfully prosecuted in you may well not have been free to commit these other later serious offences witty had set out to prey on vulnerable women said price you hid your base intentions behind a veneer of charm and lulled your victims into a false sense of security he said each of them was beguiled into believing that with your military background and apparent social attributes that you were a gentleman and would behave as one price praised the women for coming forward again after so many years saying if it had not been for the determination of wittys last victim he may never have been brought to justice witty had already raped one woman and sexually assaulted another and been arrested and released on both occasions after claiming the contact was consensual when he violently raped miss c in october telling her he could kill her and no one would do anything about it three years after the cps decided not to bring charges in miss cs case witty raped another woman police who have described witty as a predatory rapist believe there could be more victims the police let him do this said miss c who was attacked by witty in his flat after meeting him for a drink in richmond southwest london its awful because theyre the only people you depend on and they let you down i wanted them to tell me why they let him go and rape another woman they could have stopped this a long time ago who should we turn to if the police dont believe in us miss c who is in her late s said the way she was crossexamined during wittys trial in april risked putting other women off reporting rape the defence tried to discredit her account by claiming she had made up the allegation in a bid to get compensation and told the jury she had previously made four false allegations of sexual assault miss c said they were not false but merely did not go to court she had no idea the allegations would be mentioned at the end of several hours of questioning in which she had had to relive details of the rape i thought why are you letting him do this to me she said i was telling the judge this has nothing to do with the rape they need to stop them bringing in your life story they made everyone in there think im never going to report something like this because they make it so hard miss c who fled wittys home calling and knocking on doors of neighbouring flats following the attack said she was distraught after police told her he would not be charged i stood on the platform at the station and just wanted to throw myself in front of the train i was really worried angry upset about the police i was so scared of brian he knew where i lived where i worked hed said he was going to kill me that night hed told me he was exarmy and he could do anything i really thought the police would get this man because it was horrible he held my hand on a hot radiator the more i said it was hot the more he raped me even harder i thought he is going kill me now and just throw me into the canal somewhere he made me lose my job because after the attack my performance was really bad police got in touch with miss c last year to say another victim had come forward but even then officers did not initially want to reopen her case she said instead asking if she would be a witness to wittys bad character among the reasons given was the fact she had made reports of sexual assault before said the campaign group women against rape war who met the police with miss c they the police said there were all sorts of problems wars lisa longstaff added we just said you have to present the facts and argue them let the jury decide it is not unusual for women to be assaulted more than once she said according to a recent survey by mumsnet of those who had been raped or sexually assaulted had been attacked four or more times it obviously doesnt mean that if you didnt get a conviction you were lying longstaff said the cps later said it would charge witty over miss cs allegation when he was found guilty of three counts of rape and one sexual assault after five days of jury deliberations miss c was at the hairdressers i was crying she said the girls asked me what had happened and then everyone was crying too crying and hugging me but the case has reopened memories im scared because now everything has come back to me fresh miss c said i have headaches and i cant sleep i want the police to do their job properly i want men to get the message and stop raping other women because they will watch and think you raped and they didnt believe her so ill do the same detective inspector michael murfin of the mets sapphire unit which specialises in investigating rape and sexual assault said sapphire moved under the command of the specialist crime directorate in september with the aim of providing a more consistent service to victims whose care and wellbeing is at the heart of each investigation we want victims to have the confidence that we are here for them will believe them and will conduct our investigations professionally we want rapists and those committing other sex offences to know that our dedicated teams are committed to ensuring we arrest them a cps spokeswoman said there are strict rules governing the crossexamination of victims in rape cases and lawyers instructed by the cps have been told to object to unnecessary and inappropriate questions to a victim such as those on a persons previous sexual history in this instance the prosecution made written and oral submissions and the judge ruled on the appropriate scope of questioning we appreciate how harrowing cross examination during a rape trial must be for a victim and we do our very best to provide the appropriate support to assist them in giving evidence,2012-05,victim

it was only when he attacked an yearold schoolgirl on a bus that lee read was arrested but not before he had molested several women on the london underground his modus operandi would be to sit next to them cover their thighs with his overcoat and then use it as a cover to touch them inappropriately yet despite cctv footage catching the fatherofthree doing this several times during just one month of central line commuting only one adult victim of his assaults appears to have reported him and then only after he did away with the coat to grab under her skirt before following her out of the carriage reads sentencing reported in the london evening standard came just ahead of the report from the end violence against women coalition which found that an astonishing of young women in the capital have experienced sexual harassment in public spaces over the past months thats nearly half of all women between and admittedly only a small proportion of that harassment involves the sort of physical contact that has landed read with a jail sentence most of it is noncontact you know the sort of thing wolf whistles staring indecent exposure funny eh that the british have such a great reputation for reserve and respect for personal space not that this sort of behaviour is restricted to one normally uptight nation two canadian studies found that of women had experienced some form of sexual harassment a survey of new york city subway riders in conducted by the manhattan borough presidents office found that of sexual assaults on public transport arent reported at all which proves if nothing else that you dont have to be british to skulk off feeling upset and violated rather than make a fuss there is evidence that it starts young too with earlier research by the coalition finding that one in three girls report unwanted sexual contact in school the brits do have a reputation for failing to take any sort of harassment seriously i can almost hear the radio reports of the yougov survey already come on love no one died arent you more worried about paedophilia and anyway it must be good to attract attention hard to answer that one really although i do like the poster produced by lambeth council a while back that stated flirtharass real men know the difference there will be some who believe that us feminazis take all this stuff way too seriously more funlovingsophisticatedsorted europeans cut adjective to fit national stereotype dont worry about the odd wolf whistle they would if it became threatening though something the ubiquitous ciao bella of many italian men never seems to how else to explain why twice as many women as men do not feel safe using public transport in london having said all this im glad campaigners arent arguing to make more of this behaviour criminal the radio presenter is right nothing died apart from the ability of women to not feel attacked while going about their daily lives instead end violence against women wants an awareness campaign when hollaback the antistreet harassment group set up a uk operation two years ago the idea that women would shout out when the victim of sexual harassment was unheard of julia gray co director of the organisation said i was told good luck with that the wider community will never believe that women should speak up for themselves since then there has been a slew of stories in which women have publicly shamed alleged abusers remember the woman on the new york metro earlier this year to celebrate international womens day hollaback was featured in both the sun and the mail not entirely positively it has to be said but as a way of reaching a wider community it was a pretty significant moment most mornings as i sit on the northern line im confronted by a poster saying

sexual harassment is a persistent and dangerous problem on britains streets womens charities have warned as a poll reveals that more than four in young women were sexually harassed in the capital over the last year a yougov survey of londoners commissioned by end violence against women coalition evaw found that of women aged between and had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces in the last year despite a growing intolerance of unwanted sexual attention harassment was still very common and made women feel unsafe particularly when travelling alone said holly dustin director of evaw sexual harassment is so ingrained that we barely notice it but when you start talking to women almost every one has a horrible story to tell its time for society to stand up and put a stop to it schoolchildren as young as were being targeted she said with previous research for the group revealing that one in three girls in uk schools had experienced unwanted sexual contact dismissing sexual harassment from unwanted comments on the street about appearance to groping as harmless fun or complimentary was dangerous she added sexual harassment has a real impact on womens lives whether it is changing their behaviour or whether they feel safe on the streets she said it feeds into a fear of rape and sexual violence and has a harmful effect on broader issues of equality the poll also found of women aged to experienced unwanted sexual attention on public transport and of to yearolds overall of the women surveyed had experienced unwanted sexual contact on public transport fiona elvines of south london rape crisis said it was rare to meet a woman who had not suffered street harassment women manage this harassment every day in their routines and daily decisions but it has an impact on their selfesteem and body image she said women are saying that there are consequences to this and its time to start listening to them in a recent case lee read was jailed for months after groping four women and an yearold girl he put his coat over his lap before grabbing womens legs in the most serious attack he grabbed the leg of a woman in her early s on the london underground before forcibly grabbing her between the legs campaigners say women globally are increasingly challenging unwanted sexual attention using social media to bring harassers to account vicky simister the founding director of ash the uk anti street harassment campaign said the issue was not restricted to london and called for a national survey authorities could take steps to make a significant difference to womens safety she added local councils and the police need to convey a strong message that this behaviour will not be tolerated by perpetrators a good example was the flirtharass real men know the difference poster campaign by lambeth council in partnership with the metropolitan police which conveyed a notolerance message hollaback a website where women who have received unwanted sexual attention or harassment can share stories or photographs of their harassers has activists in cities in countries around the world whether it is unwanted sleazy comments or violent sexual assault street harassment is an epidemic in london said byrony beynon a codirector of hollaback london but there is definitely a groundswell of people saying this is not on it is not acceptable women are taking back the power they felt was taken away from them in that moment of harassment the organisations are calling for a public awareness campaign on transport networks similar to signs that discourage passengers from eating smelly food or putting feet on seats we are asking for training for transport staff to help them deal with these incidents and serious police intervention when it is needed said dustin of evaw but we are also asking for the wider community to recognise this is not acceptable and speak out against it when they see it happening,2012-05,sexual harassment persistent

a small number of men of pakistani heritage believe white girls are fair game for sexual abuse the conservative cochair sayeeda warsi said on friday in remarks which place her at odds with the labour mp keith vaz and some womens groups lady warsi made clear she believed race lay at the heart of the recent sexual abuse case in rochdale there is a small minority of pakistani men who believe that white girls are fair game warsi told the london evening standard after the jailing of nine men for their part in a child sexual exploitation gang we have to be prepared to say that you can only start solving a problem if you acknowledge it first warsi who is britains first muslim to have a full cabinet seat spoke out after the nine men from rochdale were jailed for a total of years at liverpool crown court last week for sexually abusing young girls the victims the youngest of whom was when the abuse began were passed around the group of men for sex after being plied with food alcohol and drugs vaz the former europe minister who is now chairman of the commons home affairs select committee said he did not believe the crimes were a race issue but warsi who was prompted to speak out after her father condemned the abuse as stomachchurningly sick took a different view in her evening standard interview this small minority who see women as second class citizens and white women probably as third class citizens are to be spoken out against she said the tory cochair also made clear that muslim leaders needed to condemn the mens behaviour these were grown men some of them religious teachers or running businesses with young families of their own they knew this was wrong whether or not these girls were easy prey they knew it was wrong in mosque after mosque after mosque this should be raised as an issue so that anybody who is remotely involved should start to feel that the community is turning on them communities have a responsibility to stand up and say this is wrong this will not be tolerated the intervention by warsi puts her at odds with some womens groups in addition to vaz speaking on the day the men were sentenced vaz said its quite wrong to stigmatise a whole community vazs remarks were echoed by marai larasi cochair of the end violence against women coalition who told the guardian last week an excessive focus on some cases of sexual exploitation with a primary focus on ethnicity rather than the exploitation itself is misleading and fuels racist attitudes which ultimately wont help women and girls warsi said she spoke out after her father safdar who arrived in britain from pakistan in with in his pocket told her to speak out over dinner shortly after the men were sentenced warsis father asked her what the government was going to do the tory cochair recalled in her interview dad then said well what are you doing about it i said oh its not me its a home office issue warsis father called on his daughter to do better he said to me sayeeda what is the point in being in a position of leadership if you dont lead on issues that are so fundamental this is so stomach churningly sick that you should have been out there condemning it as loudly as you could uniquely you are in a position to show leadership on this i thought to myself hes absolutely right warsi who praised the british muslim forum and the muslim council of britain for a fantastic response in the wake of the sentencing said the authorities should not allow cultural sensitivities to prevent investigations involving minority ethnic communities cultural sensitivity should never be a bar to applying the law she said if the authorities failed to act in an open and frontfooted way it would create a gap for extremists to fill a gap where hate can be peddled this contrasted with vaz who warned that the criminal justice system should not dance to the tune of the british national party warsi has recently faced criticism from conservative mps who believe that she is one of the cabinets weak links but warsi shored up her position last week with a strong performance in front of the conservative committee,2012-05,small number men pakistani heritage believe white

are men the new women are they having a harder time than silly moaning ladies has feminism gone too far has political correctness been put away for its own good these are such familiar cultural tropes that we may dismiss the word trope altogether instead i would use another word tripe still abundant tripe trickles down from on high even academe every so often a new tome details how men not women are discriminated against apart from rape murder equal pay genital mutilation the power imbalance in politics business education law and arts they may have a point things are tough for some guys really i know that i just find it hard to accept feminism has gone too far that a bit of underarm hair signals the end of western civilisation it is entirely possible to understand that many men are suffering at the moment without scapegoating feminism that is the david willetts manoeuvre unemployment largely affecting workingclass men is somehow the fault of middleclass women now we have professor david benatar from cape town addressing the systemic discrimination against men in a book called the second sexism as always he has to set up some straw women egalitarian feminists good against partisan feminists bad he also veers into quite bonkers territory one of the ways men are more discriminated against is that there are more of them in prison than women i may be missing something here but i thought it was to do with them doing more crime even the title annoyed me though simone de beauvoir must be twisting in her chignon for she understood sexual politcs and its contradictions there are many ways to understand power in theory read some foucault and there are many ways in practice have a relationship with another human being the power dynamics between men and women mean that it is possible to argue for equal rights for women while acknowledging that life chances for many men are also on lockdown right now in terribly poor countries girls are left to die in famines and the last food is given to baby boys while in terribly rich ones battles rage over who gets control of womens bodies women themselves or the state still benatar lists the ways in which men are discriminated against from corporal punishment to conscription to circumcision to paternity leave and bodily privacy all of this is done without class or context he is a philosopher all right and without seemingly much knowledge of actual feminism while seeking to define them he blurs the difference between disadvantage and discrimination and so ends up asking if we need affirmative action for men we already have it its called the status quo strangely enough in volume of the second sex some years ago de beauvoir spoke precisely of the prize of liberation to carry off this supreme victory men and women must among other things and beyond their natural differentiations unequivocally affirm their brotherhood distinguishing sex from gender one is not born but rather becomes a woman she set off a train of thought about how we all construct ourselves freedom from the straitjacket of femininity for women brings with it a freedom for men too for the price they pay for their dominance is well documented in terms of mens mental and physical health it is no shock though that at a time when womens rights are under attack austerity hitting women hardest abortion under threat the politics of envy rears its head for it is victimenvy this metoo masculism or lets just call it out it is basic conservatism that says any challenge to the system any rights won have gone too far these people cannot speak about the inequalities riven between classes ethnicities and genders because its all about individuals who power through thus we have the mutant tory feminists whose credo is i can have my cake and eat it get your own cake i mind that they dont share the cake but not whether they keep their faces honeymoonfresh or not i am simply bewildered by a feminism that would not want to advance womens control of their own reproduction still we all get bamboozled with the choices women now have despite everyday stories of violence and abuse against women we are now to refer to prostitution as sex work i still await the dinner party where middleclass parents tell me tom is doing his law conversion but even though charlotte hasnt done her sats she already says she want to do sex work we always knew she was entrepreneurial it is clear that all kinds of people are in pain right now male and female victimhood is not an olympic sport this was captured succinctly on international womens day by the hashtag whataboutthemenz to be antisexist means to fight sexism not to try to commandeer it or to reclaim it for men indeed this move to consign sexual inequality to the past when it is a clear and present danger has to be countered and it would be if feminism got itself in gear never mind going too far,2012-05,men new woman harder time silly moaning lady ha

a takeaway owner has been jailed for years for attempting to recruit girls as young as into prostitution and paying other teenagers for sex in a case which was described as cold clinical exploitation of the desperate and the vulnerable azad miah a married father of four children was found guilty at carlisle crown court of running a brothel from his business inciting girls aged between and to prostitute he was also convicted of paying two teenagers for sex the owner of the spice of india restaurant now under new management denied all the charges relating to the five victims the court heard that a yearold victim complained to police on three occasions in about miah persistently harassing her but it was three years before he was arrested she eventually gave up complaining as nothing was done when the victim was interviewed following his arrest she was asked by police if she knew why she was being questioned and replied because of something that happened three years ago and now you have finally decided to do something about it the prosecution described the abuse as cold clinical exploitation of the desperate and the vulnerable miah told one of his victims in my country it doesnt matter about age the court heard that miah a bangladeshi national regarded the girls as fresh meat and asked prostitutes at the brothel to find young girls whom he bombarded with hundreds of text messages promising to give them drugs alcohol and money in return for sex sentencing him to a total of years on tuesday judge peter hughes said this case reveals the seedier side of life in our town and city centres and what can happen to vulnerable and immature girls there are lessons from this case for us all to learn there are lessons for parents to learn whose responsibility it is to protect their children there are lessons for those responsible for safeguarding vulnerable children from deprived backgrounds and without appropriate parental care and guidance hughes said there were lessons for the police to be ever vigilant to detect signs of the possible exploitation and abuse of vulnerable people and to take seriously what they say however chaotic and difficult their lives may be the judge said a sad feature of the case was that there were a number of occasions when witnesses complained to police or community support officers about the defendant pestering them but their complaints were not taken further as a result opportunities were missed he added hughes said the investigation owed much to the dedication and determination of one officer to trace the witnesses and make it possible for them to feel they could come forward he told miah that his conduct corrodes the foundations of decency and respect by which all rightthinking people live their lives he said miah had shown a total and selfish disregard for the victims welfare one of the victims was encouraged to have sex with miah as she was desperate for money when she was the other who was a heroin user had a twoyear sexual relationship with him which began when she was tim evans prosecuting told the court the defendant sought to persuade a variety of young girls to have sex with him for money or the equivalent of money via the provision of drugs and drink the attempted persuasion was persistent he would hound young girls for periods of weeks or months face to face and over the phone more worryingly he would stalk some of them following them home in particular during police interviews miah admitted being addicted to sex but said the allegations had been concocted by druggists who were upset when he stopped giving them food and money miah targeted the girls because he thought they would be less likely to be believed than the respectable businessman he purported to be the court heard he was jailed for nine years for four counts of paying for the sexual services of a child between and one of keeping a brothel between and and five years for the charges of inciting child prostitution he was cleared of child prostitution charges relating to two other girls detective constable christy robertson who interviewed miah said he showed horrendous contempt for his victims whom he targeted because of their vulnerable and chaotic backgrounds she said even in their worst state of addiction they knew this wasnt right and they knew this was their way of hopefully putting a stop to what was

nine men have been arrested after police said that they had uncovered a suspected second childsex grooming ring in east lancashire the men aged between and and from rochdale have been questioned on suspicion of sexually abusing a girl it is the latest investigation by greater manchester police who smashed a childsex ring that last week led to the jailing of nine men officers said the new arrests were not directly related to the conviction of the nine asian men from rochdale and nearby oldham who were jailed over the sexual exploitation of white girls as young as the latest allegations of abuse are believed to involve a sixyear period starting in when the girl was in her teens sources have described her as extremely vulnerable detectives investigating the case are understood to have carried out video interviews with the girl who told them that she knew the men only by nicknames one senior detective said inquiries are continuing just because the trial has finished and nine men have been convicted does not mean the operation has stopped we are continuing to chip away the men involved in the most recent allegations have been bailed pending further inquiries a file of evidence on the new arrests is expected to be handed over to the crown prosecution service within weeks during the trial that led to last weeks convictions five girls gave evidence of the abuse they suffered between however police believe there may have been up to victims following the trial chief constable of greater manchester police peter fahy said he hoped more victims of sexual abuse would come forward and said it was likely more arrests would be made but he said the vulnerability of the witnesses made it difficult to bring the cases to court describing the girls as damaged individuals all five girls who testified were known to social services at some stage in their lives on sentencing at liverpool crown court judge gerald clifton said the convicted men treated the girls as though they were worthless and beyond respect detectives are exploring possible links between the two groups of men although none is thought to have been established so far the arrested men are thought to be from asian and afrocaribbean backgrounds the conclusion of the case last week triggered a major debate about whether the crimes were racially motivated commenting on the latest arrests rochdale mp simon

into the open on his watch how did neville husband get away with the horrific abuse of teenagers in his care weekend april nareys racist spotlight on asian men conveniently obscures the action and inaction of police cps and social workers who allowed the rape of more than children over years why didnt they stop it your editorial asks the question but blames the poor chaotic family lives of the victims this is about class not race does that mean police and others ignored the child who described what was being done to her four years ago because of her class whenever a serial rape hits the

imprisoned after they refused to retract their allegations despite police pressure and michael doherty prosecuted for harassing the police after he complained of inaction when he reported that a

the brutal exploitation of scores of vulnerable young teenage girls in rochdale raises many troubling questions yesterday most of the perpetrators received long prison sentences but in the aftermath it is important to examine how the girls came to be in such an exposed position and why their families and then the agencies of the state that are supposed to help and protect them failed so miserably separately and in the wider context equally important is the suggestion that early allegations were not properly investigated first because police feared being branded as racist and second they were worried about the risk of provoking exactly the bnpstyle backlash that has resulted in trial lawyers being assaulted and in february unrest on the streets of heywood the extreme right did its best to fan the racist claim nearly causing the case to collapse when the bnp leader nick griffin tweeted the news that seven of the nine defendants were convicted before it had been reported in court in their turn some of the defendants accused the judge and jury of prejudice he made me feel pretty said the victim who tried to raise the alarm four years ago of the first man to rape her the abuse of young girls who lack the kind of family life that would keep them safe has been steadily increasing for years a third of the victims are in care the rest tend to come from poor homes to have low selfesteem and little confidence in their ability to change their lives easy pickings for the exploitative and unscrupulous worse when this victim finally found the courage to report what was happening in first the police and then the crown prosecution service refused to treat her as a credible witness and the case was dropped they insist there could be no repetition now and claim awareness of the problem of grooming has become much more sophisticated too many children have been abused over the past years or more for this to be a sufficient explanation a search for excuses may be one reason for claiming that concern about appearing racist hindered the original investigation this is turning the genuine issue of racism into a whole new genre of prejudice a resentful moan against those who are supposed to neuter public discourse by imposing an abstract political correctness but despite the assertions of wellregarded commentators such as martin narey this is not an ethnic or cultural crime this kind of grooming is not uniquely or even predominantly carried out by any one ethnic or religious group more than nine in of those on the sex offenders register are white

arrested for being a public nuisance outside a takeaway shop the yearold blamed her behaviour screaming and bashing the counter on the systemic abuse she had suffered at the hands of two men inside during six hours of videotaped testimony she went on to say how shed been lured in by the men with gifts drinks and a phone card or maybe something to eat and made to feel pretty before eventually being asked to pay for the vodka with sex she even handed over underwear spotted with the yearold accuseds dna nine months later in august the crown prosecution service decided not to charge the two men as the girl would make an unreliable witness and the lawyer doubted any jury would believe her so far so typical of the reported cases of sexual offences involving children under just went to trial last year according to the cps thats just under a quarter of all reported cases and according to nspcc research a third of children who are sexually abused do not tell anyone at all about it let alone report it to the police yet the case of the teenager and the takeaway shop bucked the statistical trend this week when the girls evidence formed a central part of the case against a gang of nine men who were each sentenced to between four and years after being found guilty of child sex offences including rape and trafficking in the reporting of the rochdale grooming trial much has been made of the fact that the men were largely pakistani while the victims although only seven gave evidence were all white and working class the victims were aged between and at the time of the abuse and police described them as being from chaotic and council estate backgrounds not so much has been made of why the young girls allegations werent believed in the first place nor how the reporting of this case could lead to a similar kind of stereotype and myth around sexual violence by focusing on the race element of this crime something stirred up by the outrageous behaviour of the english defence league and bnp outside the liverpool courtroom it is easy to lose sight of the fact that this is a broad narrative of abuse and is not unique to one community marai larasi a director of imkaan and cochair of the end violence against women coalition warns an excessive focus on some cases of sexual exploitation with a primary focus on ethnicity rather than the exploitation itself is misleading and fuels racist attitudes which ultimately wont help women and girls nazir afzal the newly appointed chief crown prosecutor for the north west who was responsible for bringing the perpetrators to trial today told the guardian it wasnt their race which defined them it was their treatment of women before adding there is no community where women and girls are not vulnerable to sexual attack and thats a fact in one of his first decisions when appointed to the job a year ago afzal who has pioneered work to tackle honourbased violence and forced marriage as well as violence against women more broadly reopened the case after watching the testimony it is rare for the cps to reverse a decision and is only done if the senior prosecutor believes it to be wrong and necessary in order to maintain public confidence what made afzal believe the witness when his predecessors at one point in the video testimony a police officer is reported to be yawning did not he credits a better understanding of sexual offences full stop over the last few years there were a lot of myths and stereotypes surrounding sexual assault so to be a victim you have to be beaten up or a total innocent but not everybody comes out of a nunnery these girls lived troubled lives but just because somebody has a troubled background doesnt mean she is not telling the truth the fact that it takes a senior member of the cps to say such a thing is perhaps telling afzal who is of pakistani origin has talked of being bullied racially abused and then attacked when he was at university those first two decades of my life the way id been brought up was dont bother telling the police theres no point yet the failures in rochdale are not just about one decision taken by a cps lawyer which is now subject to an investigation by the independent police complaints commission nor the fact that they appear to have been subsequently made good by another larasi at imkaan says there may be issues of ethnicity but only in helping public authorities recognise and deal with predatory behaviour there is evidence that communities with strong male bonds can lead to a culture of silence look at the priesthood as an example and not just at a subset of pakistani society but it remains to be said that while there might be a higher incidence of onstreet grooming among some asian men most sexual offences are carried out by white men acting alone according to the cps agencies working with victims of sexual violence such as imkaan and the cps believe that much of the work to be done is about busting stereotypes and raising awareness about such abuse the focal point of this should be the fact that vulnerable young people are being targeted says larasi prosecuting rachel smith qc described the victims to the jury as the sort of children who were easy to identify target and exploit for the sexual gratification of these men so rather than being preyed on because they are white these girls were victims because they were seen as weak and vulnerable in other words similar to most victims of predatory sexual violence detective chief superintendent mary doyle of greater manchester police has said there is no evidence that they were targeted because they were white they were targeted because they were there an investigation by the child exploitation and online protection centre found that a third of the child victims of streetgrooming last year were in care when they were abused so what can we do to prevent such abuses taking place the head of the cps in london alison saunders suggested that public perceptions themselves were to blame for the failure to secure more convictions of suspected rapists such as the demonisation of women who drink for example or those who had previously had a relationship with the accused cps lawyers decide to prosecute such cases only if they believe they will pass muster with juries you can see how some members of the jury can come along with preconceived ideas they might still subscribe to the myths and stereotypes that we have all had a go at busting says saunders who has introduced training for officers to counteract these stereotypes as well as to identify the vulnerable and those likely to prey on them larasi at imkaan has called for an interagency response where all public sector agencies from the schools who spot absenteeism to the police and social services should coordinate responses and share information about vulnerable people there are clear gaps in the way we are dealing with the issues we need stronger responses in order to make sure girls receive the protection and support they need at critical points and to prevent these crimes from happening in the first place afzal has not shied away from the fact that asian men are disproportionately responsible for onstreet grooming previously vilified for his role in highlighting female genital mutilation for example he calls different cultural habits the elephant in the room but in most cases of sexual assault including the rochdale grooming offences men prey on girls because they were perceived to be unwanted unloved they were on the streets late and nobody seemed to care again underlying the fact that as with most cases of rape or sexual assault it is the powerful preying on the weak rather than for the colour of their skin he also believes that more discussion about sexual assault and understanding for the victims will lead to a greater conviction rate and encourage more women and children to come forward sexual assault is the great silent crime of our time and the silence makes it invidious its the kind of crime that prefers darkness and we need to shine a light on it and for that we all share a responsibilty every community worker

much of the media coverage and discussion of the trial of nine men convicted of sexually abusing five teenage girls is focused on ethnicity that eight of the perpetrators are asian appears to be more relevant than the reasons why the rape of young vulnerable girls is so widespread and the crime so difficult to prosecute i have written about organised criminal gangs grooming young girls for sex on a few occasions during the past five years such as the disappearance of charlene downes who was when she went missing in and has never been found what was discovered during the police investigation however was endemic child sexual abuse and prostitution in her home town of blackpool dozens of girls were being bought and sold for a bag of chips cigarettes and vodka by sexual predators of all ages cultures and ethnicities it is my firm belief based on interviews with a number of victims family members campaigners and professionals such as police and social workers that where the gangs are of asian origin there has been a tendency in some areas of england to ignore the issue for fear of being branded racist i have also been clear that ethnicity of perpetrators is indeed relevant in that folk seem to be more interested and appalled by criminal gangs raping girls when the gang is asian contrary to what the british national party would have us believe this is not an epidemic of pakistani child abusers abusing white girls it is more that we as a society ignore the voices of those who know best about child abuse the victims and their advocates the uncomfortable truth is that there is complacency about organised sexual exploitation which leads to few convictions regardless of the ethnicity of the perpetrators we choose instead to blame the victims why otherwise would girls who are raped and sexually exploited be so routinely disbelieved why are we not hearing more outrage about the fact that the victim who came forward in this case four years ago was deemed not to be a credible witness by the crown prosecution service had she been taken seriously this gang could have been detected and scores of other victims could have been spared we kid ourselves if we think the cps would have pushed ahead if her rapists had been white despite the traumatic effects of child sexual grooming on both the victims and their families we are still not convicting many of those responsible what we know from those victims who have dared come forward is this the process by which offenders select and manipulate victims is organised and complex first there is the gaining of trust next desensitisation the normalisation of abusive acts to the point where the victim comes to believe she deserves it isolation from friends family members and school and sexualisation so that the girls act out their abuse in a way that results in them being seen as asking for it rather than abused a deadly combination of threats and bribes secures victims compliance but there is much we do not know which is why so many of these gangs escape detection there is also a distinct lack of knowledge about how best to protect victims and secure convictions when they do come forward we choose to know about the ethnicity of the perpetrators when what we need to discover is how such gangs operate where they prostitute the girls and what happens to the money they make from this vile operation let us listen to the experts within the criminal justice and child protection system and more important the girls and their families about how we can carry out proper prevention and risk assessment the truth is that the victims of the most horrendous abuse are being let down viewed as troublemaking slags in fact which is why opportunist grooming gangs can get away with it so often greater manchester police apologised to the victims of the recent case saying that now that they know more about this type of crime they would conduct future investigations differently and yet those of us who are involved in the attempt to combat child sexual exploitation have known about these men and the way they operate for decades the victims have told us why have they been sidelined once again in

i bridled when i first read todays front page headline in the times a nations shame over its account of the nine men found guilty of sexually abusing girls in the manchester area and the wider abuse that exists in englands childrens homes it seemed both daft and meaningless unless the nation shamed was pakistan from which eight of the nine convicted men hailed but that would be a bit sweeping too on reflection there is scope for wider regret beyond those directly involved poor exmill towns in the northwest carry great burdens from our shared past and enough is never done to ease their distress childrens homes from which so many of the predators victims were plucked are all too often neglected corners of our society too the police ignored initial complaints from troubled teenagers so shame on us all heres helen carters coverage of this grim trial at liverpool crown court which ended on monday with the nine convictions and heres her wider background reporting here too for the guardian its grisly stuff the kind of issue our respectable victorian ancestors also struggled to deal with only protecting children from being carnally abused under the age of in as this useful summary reminds us so exploitation of the poor and vulnerable women and girls in particular has been with society for ever much of it brushed under the carpet as too difficult to comprehend let alone resolve one familiar response that the jury in liverpool heard was that the girls not their rapists were the exploiters streetsmart greedy and immoral i didnt know how old she was that sort of excuse too how different cultures and societies treat their women is a crucial test of justice fairness efficiency and modernity in the st century the countries where they are most equal are i think we can sustain this generalisation the societies that tend to be richer fairer and more competent though scandinavian sex tourism and the breivik trial in oslo remind us too that such countries policies are not problemfree in this case familiar issues of class and gender are compounded by race the times has been the newspaper most active in exposing the sort of crimes that have been coming to trial in the midlands and north do liberal media tend to shy away i wonder and its coverage today paywall does not hesitate to identify what headline writers its a shorter word call asian networks of abuse martin narey saintly exhead of barnardos and much else talks on the radio more precisely and judiciously about the disproportionate number of men of pakistani origin involved in such crimes mondays ninth convicted man was an illegal immigrant of afghan background it seems like a blindingly obvious point to make much like saying that city fat cats overpaid and overweight are disproportionately white and middle aged yet we have to be careful heres a wellresearched piece on comment is free that attempts to provide calm context and warns against offender profiling based on race white sex offenders tend to act alone is that really true whereas the pakistanis convicted here acted together more research is needed well yes but all sorts of people who are usually quite willing in some cases eager to categorise many of societys ills in terms of discrimination over race and racism yes keith vaz mp i include you when the victim comes from an ethnic or national minority throw their hands up in horror at those who highlight the pakistani or asian connection here the race relations industry goes into a curious reverse at one level we can understand why the bnp english defence league and other professional racists are keen to get their crowbars into cases such as this two asian lawyers pulled out of the original trial it had to be abandoned after being threatened only last week nick griffin whom older readers may remember as the bnp leader accurately tweeted seven of the muslim paedophile rapists found guilty in liverpool since the jury was still deliberating its overall verdict cut off from the outside world without their mobiles this caused a stir and the defence asked for the case to be abandoned the judge took a more robust view of the taxpayers interest satisfied himself that no juror had misbehaved and pressed ahead an odd incident though one that will please conspiracy theorists of all persuasions while the age of twitter mania lasts there will be more such but does the fact that the hooligan wing of politics seeks to exploit community anger at such cases there has been public disorder in some towns over the affair we now learn prevent the rest of us looking at this straight in the eye obviously it does for many but it shouldnt we see the inhibition problem in social care cases such as little victoria climbi in the genetic disorders caused by cousin marriage a bradford report widely ignored last month in the backstreet female circumcision horrors exposed by the sunday times the other weekend on radio this morning my early listening of choice keith vaz a catholic born in aden of goan stock by the way complained about the perils of stigmatising a whole community and produced stats that show more youngsters are abused by white men than by pakistanis well yes that would be likely in britain wouldnt it the greater manchester police and others concerned for public order make the same point not all the perpetrators were pakistani brits not all the girls involved were white none of my asian constituents in prosperous leicester have complained to me that this is going on says vaz theyre horrified too they have wives and daughters this is surely true of most british muslims as it is of the rest of us but isnt it also a little disingenuous isnt nareys gentle use of disproportionate a better way of expressing it writing in tuesdays times mohammed shafiq chief executive of the rochdalebased ramadhan foundation reports how elders in his own community have shrugged their shoulders at childsex grooming by young men sometimes aware that it is shameful sometimes inclined to keep silent rather than do the bnps work for it sometimes inclined to blame wider british society for the oversexualisation good point of the young shafiq himself has been campaigning in vain for years and now declares the taboo broken good he also reports that of the recent spate of convictions have been of men of pakistani origin he praises the courage of the girls who spoke out to give evidence and reminds lancashire muslim community elders that they are no different from our own wives and daughters thats an important point because the trial again made clear that the convicted rapists did not regard their victims as such quite the opposite they were trying to square their highly conservative cultural traditions those of rural pakistani villages often their religious piety too one of the rapists was revered for his knowledge of the quran with their need for offthebooks sex poor english girls plied with drink and threats were one solution this otherness is crucial to most forms of cruelty down the ages once the perpetrator has established the lessthanhuman inferiority of their victim yids polacks niggers pakis chinks abos kaffirs then anything is permissible the british empire did its share as do most empires past and present to the litany of familiar abuse can now be added lancashire girls the good aspect of such stories is that there is usually not always someone who speaks out against an injustice mohammed shafiq being one such in this case and will not be silenced it is also possible to see this case as he does in generational terms the old and staid the ignorant newcomers from remote traditional villages half a world away think such abuses tolerable or prefer to turn a blind eye the young integrated and better educated think otherwise in the bradford west byelection last month it was as helen pidd explained in the guardian respects george galloway not the local labour party who caught the tide of modernity

the former head of barnardos has said that street grooming of teenage girls for sex in the north of england appears to be carried out overwhelmingly by men of pakistani and afghan origin and has called for an investigation into the issue martin nareys comments came as nine men one from afghanistan and the rest with pakistani backgrounds await sentencing for being part of a child exploitation gang that passed vulnerable girls around a group of men for sex in the heywood area of rochdale greater manchester in and he said he was not stigmatising the asian community as a whole noting that during his time managing the prison service prior to joining barnardos sex offenders were overwhelmingly white but the labour mp keith vaz warned the bnp was setting the agenda narey told bbc radio s today programme for this particular type of crime the street grooming of teenage girls in northern towns there is very troubling evidence that asians are overwhelmingly represented in the prosecutions for such offences narey said he did not know the reason for the overrepresentation of men of pakistani and afghan origin and rejected the idea they were specifically targeting white girls he suggested that vulnerable girls on the streets were more likely to be white while asian girls subjected to strict parenting were more likely to be at home and so less prone to fall victim to such crimes he added im not saying this is just asian or pakistani men but street trafficking in the north does appear be overwhelmingly about pakistani and afghan men vaz chair of the home affairs select committee warned against generalisations and said the criminal justice system shouldnt dance to the tune of the bnp security outside liverpool crown court where the nine men were tried was stepped up after hundreds of english defence league and bnp protesters picketed the court the trial was almost derailed when the british national party leader nick griffin tweeted that seven verdicts had been reached in an alleged contempt of court the beginning of the trial was also delayed for a fortnight in february when two asian defence barristers were attacked outside the courtroom by farright protesters vaz told the today programme that the police themselves had said it was not a race issue citing greater manchesters assistant chief constable steve heywood who said it just happens that in the particular area and time the demographics were that these were asian men vaz the mp for leicester east said its quite wrong to stigmatise a whole community this is where it all ends up its already extended from pakistani men into asian men thats a very wide group he added what the bnp is saying is that this is a crime committed by pakistani men and asian men thats wrong narey said the fact the bnp was trying to make political capital out of the case should not prevent discussion abdul aziz abdul rauf mohammed sajid adil khan abdul qayyum mohammed amin hamid safi kabeer hassan and a yearold who cannot be

nine men have been found guilty of being part of a child sexual exploitation gang that targeted vulnerable girls plying them with fast food alcohol drugs and gifts so they could pass them around a group of men for sex during the course of the complex inquiry into the grooming case police identified and interviewed young girls who were potential victims of the gang which was active in the heywood area of rochdale greater manchester in and a yearold girl complained to police that she was being abused four years ago but police initially failed to pursue her case because the crown prosecution service advised them she was not a credible enough witness the independent police complaints commission is supervising an inquiry into the investigation initially no charges were brought against the teenagers attackers a yearold man who cannot be named for legal reasons and kabeer hassan but both were convicted on tuesday following a twomonth trial in liverpool the victims were targeted by abdul aziz abdul rauf mohammed sajid adil khan abdul qayyum mohammed amin hamid safi hassan and the yearold police are still searching for another man mohammed shazad who absconded while on bail following his first arrest one yearold victim became pregnant and had the child aborted another gave evidence of being raped by two men while she was so drunk she was vomiting over the side of the bed and later cried herself to sleep the victims who were said to be from chaotic backgrounds were raped and physically assaulted and forced to have sex with several men in a day several times a week the men who are all of british pakistani heritage apart from safi who is from afghanistan groomed the teenage girls who would often be found hanging around kebab shops late at night befriending the staff the court heard that they acted together to sexually exploit the girls barnardos chief executive ann marie carrie said the low conviction rate on sexual exploitation cases was extremely worrying the charity is aware of investigations of which only have resulted in convictions she said it was imperative that child exploitation was recognised as a form of abuse that required the full attention of those who worked with children cheryl eastwood director for children schools and families at rochdale council admitted theres a great deal more to do to tackle child sexual exploitation and the abuse of vulnerable people she said the girls in the case had been very brave and there was now more preventative work being done to raise awareness of the issue among children parents and professional staff the jurors retired to consider their verdicts at liverpool crown court last week and returned partial verdicts last thursday which the judge ordered could not be made public the trial was almost derailed when the british national party leader nick griffin tweeted that seven verdicts had been reached which was an alleged contempt of court it is not clear how he learned of the jurys decision as reporting restrictions were in place at the time the defence urged the judge to discharge the jury as the comment was accurate however it emerged that the message could not have originated from the jury room as they were deliberating at the time and had no access to electronic devices the trial was also delayed for a fortnight at the outset in february when two asian defence barristers were attacked outside the courtroom by the far right security was stepped up after hundreds of english defence league and bnp protesters picketed the court both barristers quit the case as they feared their photographs had been placed on racist websites three days after the trial began a mob gathered in the heywood area of rochdale and threw bricks at takeaways and police a police officer suffered slight injuries simon nichol defence barrister for the yearold man said from the outset of this trial there have been attempts by farright organisations to influence the outcome his client had to be removed from the court as the first verdicts were announced the defendant shouted at the judge i dont want this biased jury you are a biased judge you are a racist bastard you bastard he was restrained and removed from the dock adil khan also stood up and said i dont want to attend for a bnp jury and left the dock greater manchesters assistant chief constable steve heywood said police had not given the victim the help that she needed and he apologised we are now in a different position than they were in and we understand the problem better than we did he said he maintained that the problem of onstreet grooming of children was not a race issue and was about adults preying on vulnerable young children it just happens that in the particular area and time the demographics were that these were asian men however in large parts of the country we are seeing onstreet grooming child sexual exploitation happening in each of our towns and it isnt about a race issue the association of chief police officers lead on child protection and child abuse peter davies said he congratulated everyone involved in bringing the perpetrators to justice and by doing so protecting its victims and preventing more harm he said child sexual exploitation spanned all cultures and ethnicities and when cultural issues arose it was important to work across all boundaries to tackle it a key concern is the vulnerability of young people who are targeted he said several police forces have clearly been proactive in preventing child sexual exploitation and grooming and recent court successes are a result of lengthy investigations jon brown head of strategy for sexual abuse at the nspcc said the guilty verdicts showed these men to be dangerous and manipulative individuals who purposely targeted vulnerable teenagers for their own sexual gratification he said they conspired together to target girls as young as and plied them with drugs and alcohol before sexually abusing them he said the charity knew this type of grooming and child exploitation seriously damaged young peoples lives it is a corrosive problem that needs serious research and action to help those affected brown added he urged the judge to hand down sentences to reflect the damaging nature of the appalling offences and the ruthless way the men treated their victims the nine men will be sentenced on wednesday the rochdale mp simon danczuk criticised the police for their inaction four years ago and said if the police had acted seriously on the concerns many of the victims of this appalling case would not have had to go through such horrific trauma the yearold man was found guilty of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child under two rapes aiding and abetting a rape one sexual assault and trafficking within the uk for sexual exploitation aziz was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking and hassan was convicted of conspiracy and rape khan and rauf were guilty of

one of the victims had sex with men in one night when she was drunk according to police the girl was and can barely recount events but her friend recalls men queueing up outside a bedroom another had drunk so much alcohol she was raped by two men while she was vomiting over the side of a bed she then cried herself to sleep all the girls targeted by the gang of nine men convicted on tuesday of sexually exploiting the girls were vulnerable and from broken homes hanging around takeaway shops in heywood near rochdale late at night and befriending the staff there they were plied with drugs alcohol food and gifts some of the men paid them to be introduced to younger girls and they were shared among the men five girls were initially identified as victims of child sexual exploitation but during the course of the police investigation involving the nine offenders who were chiefly british pakistani men with ordinary jobs often married and wellrespected within their community the police identified a further victims greater manchester police first heard about the grooming when one of the teenage girls made a complaint four years ago detectives took her case seriously and offered her support but controversially the crown prosecution service took the decision in not to charge two of the men convicted on tuesday a yearold who cannot be named for legal reasons and kabeer hassan despite one of the victims giving a lengthy videotaped interview to police dna evidence was collected from the girls clothing that was crucial to the case the decision not to prosecute was hastily overturned in summer when the northwests new chief crown prosecutor nazir afzal took up his post afzal said the original prosecuting decision was based on the credibility of the victim and the original lawyer felt there was insufficient credibility to secure a conviction i formed the opinion she was entirely credible and the two suspects should be charged he said it is very rare for a chief prosecutor to overturn a decision in this way it happens only once or twice a year the matter has voluntarily been referred to the independent police complaints commission which is supervising a greater manchester police inquiry it will report at a later date greater manchester police have publicly apologised to the victims adding that with hindsight things would be done differently now as more is much known about this type of criminality its genuinely about vulnerability and demographics assistant chief constable steve heywood said this is about adults preying on the vulnerability of young members of society coverage of the phenomenon of onstreet grooming has often characterised the issue as being about gangs of asian men preying on white girls and the case has sparked concerns about racial tensions in the northwest and the input of farright elements the child exploitation and online protection centre ceop carried out a study of onstreet grooming that showed that of offenders nearly half were of asian heritage but the police say the phenomenon is not restricted to any one race the vast majority of those on the sex offenders register in greater manchester are white child sexual exploitation is not confined to one community age demographic social status or gender said ceop it found that in one case the first contact had been a white british male who groomed the girls as girlfriends then passed them on to an asian gang ceops chief executive peter davies said sexual exploitation of children was child abuse and often involved rape he said it was premeditated carried out systematically and with a complete lack of respect or empathy for the victims they are often singled out for their vulnerability a ceop report published in spoke of the difficulties with cps solicitors often reluctant to take up cases of child sexual exploitation because victims are often perceived as unreliable detective chief superintendent mary doyle of greater manchester police said as long as there are adults willing to abuse vulnerable children and other adults it will continue on the issue of race she said it was about vulnerability not ethnicity i think if we start to get ourselves hung up on race and ethnicity issues we take away the real issues she said one of the victims who was in the care of rochdale local authority wrote a note to a member of staff saying she needed to move out but refused to elaborate the staff member told the trial she said she needed to be moved for her safety as well as our own but would not say what that actually involved days later she handed him a second note it said asians pick me up they get me drunk they give me drugs they have sex with me and pay me not to tell anyone i want to move the note was read to the jury giving evidence the yearold defendant who cannot be identified claimed the girls were clever and ran a business empire that extended from leeds to nelson and bradford one of the girls caused problems for him and corrupted the others he said but it was a version of events the jury rejected the man lost his temper in the witness box shouting its all white lies shame on the police youre looking for scapegoats where are the white people the trial was beset by difficulties as the far right stirred up unrest picketing outside liverpool crown court a defence barrister was assaulted and refused to return to court delaying the case as a new defence team took it on as the first verdicts came in the leader of the bnp nick griffin tweeted about it a potential contempt of court the coverage of the case also had a knockon effect on community tensions in heywood in february concerns emerged over racial tensions after trouble broke out and young people congregated in the centre of town a car and three police vehicles were damaged and an officer suffered bruising to his arm and legs greater manchester police in effect issued a curfew when they warned all parents in the area to ensure their children were at home within an hour the streets were clear the chief constable peter fahy blamed outsiders who would like to see groups turn against each other for their own ends in the end tensions calmed mohammed shafiq director of the ramadhan foundation said of the recent convictions involving child sexual exploitation were of british pakistani men so clearly we have got a problem when it comes to onstreet grooming shafiq said that a minority of pakistani men thought white girls were worthless a viewpoint he and he said the majority of the community found abhorrent the

in january the times proclaimed a conspiracy of silence around groups of pakistani men sexually exploiting white british girls political correctness and fear of appearing racist had trumped child protection the paper claimed soon the terms pakistani and asian were being conflated much to the disgruntlement of other british asians and a heated media debate ensued around the asian sex gang problem jack straw demanded the pakistani community take responsibility while bnp leader nick griffin gleefully decried muslim paedophilia campaigning with natty slogans such as our children are not halal meat the edl were regulars at major trials either in the courtroom taking notes or outside spitting hate the defendants in question are at most nominally muslim practising muslims certainly arent supposed to have sex with children but race has proved a contentious and enduring feature of this crimes coverage opinions have been vociferous and commentators have rushed to explain a racial profile that is yet to be established clearly and there have been official studies and action plans today saw the culmination of a major investigation the latest in a series of highprofile trials involving large groups of adults sexually exploiting british children all nine of those found guilty of crimes in the area of rochdale greater manchester had conspicuously asian names as researchers specialising in this crime we are repeatedly asked are onstreet groomers pakistani the honest answer is yes and no there is still no reliable estimate of the number of onstreet groomers nationwide let alone of their ethnicity crime is usually measured using police or court records those onstreet grooming cases that are actually reported are difficult to disentangle from other crimes this is because onstreet grooming is not a criminal offence instead cases are charged under a wide variety of offences from rape to internal sex trafficking to false imprisonment at present the closest we have to a national estimate comes from ceops scoping study into localised grooming roughly synonymous with onstreet grooming response rates to the researchers request for data from police childrens services and the third sector were low based on these patchy data ceop suggest there are over potential offenders in the uk most of these however will never have been formally identified let alone arrested charged or prosecuted ethnicity data were available for just onethird of these were white and asian the proportion of pakistani asians remains unknown however in a country where asians constitute of the general population this is a striking figure we believe that there are two main profiles of the onstreet groomer first we have the white offenders who typically offend alone so far nothing new the lone white male is the norm for uk child sex offences second however there are asian offenders many of whom are of pakistani origin they seem much more likely to offend in groups lending their abuse a curiously social dimension in our research which focuses on large offending groups we analysed police data from five major onstreet grooming investigations of the suspects charged were asian pakistani asian other and white british these are shocking statistics and the overrepresentation of asian offenders within this dataset certainly merits attention there may be important factors that explain why the bigger networks have been largely asian nonetheless it is crucial to remember that these cases do not paint a full picture of this crime if onstreet grooming continues to be reduced to the big asian networks alone a whole host of other offenders will get overlooked the current obsession with asian sex gangs focuses too narrowly on one dimension to this crime making the emergent profile of the pakistani groomer misleading it is also unhelpful there are more than million pakistanis in britain are we going to order surveillance on all the adult males take their fingerprints get their dna profiles after all a tiny minority may be abusing children racial profiles are notoriously problematic their application raises serious ethical issues and risks isolating the nondeviant majority ask anyone with an arabicsounding name randomly selected for extra searches by us airport security not always that accurate in the first place these profiles are also liable to change and quickly there have been so few investigations of large offending groups that a few cases involving big nonasian groups could easily shift these offender profiles in a whole new direction whether this happens or not remains to be seen but entrenched stereotypes have a nasty habit of persisting even when the evidence moves on at the moment our nationwide figures on onstreet grooming are patchy and incomplete we need a better more efficient system of data collection and collation whats more these data need to be comparable and consistent across the country and across different agencies involved for this to happen we desperately need a clear definition of this crime type agreed upon and adhered to by all relevant statutory agencies including the police childrens services and the third sector in future this approach would yield a far more accurate picture of offending and inform more effective and targeted responses in the meantime there are plenty of things to be getting on with that dont depend on offender profiling the best bits of policing nationwide need to become more widely adopted innovative antiexploitation teams training programmes for frontline officers and brave approaches to covert investigations often dubbed the missing part of the jigsaw healthcare and education have a crucial part to play in spotting and supporting victims underused provisions which could protect victims giving evidence in complex cases should revisited for example prerecorded cross examinations by a neutral third party could save victims the trauma of being interrogated by multiple defence barristers

the girl whose complaint to police in led to the conviction on tuesday of nine men for running a child sex ring said the grooming began when a friend introduced her to men who promised her free alcohol and cigarettes food and taxis and things she thought it was great at first because there were no sexual strings attached i just thought i can get all this stuff for free and then i ended up living pretty much with this girl because i thought how good it was and i could do what i want thats when the relationship turned bad with my mum and dad because of the way i was acting she said the first time she was attacked you dont expect anything like that to happen i just thought i was having a good time with this getting drunk and stuff i was young and i didnt think theyd want me the men did not talk to the girls much wed be upstairs above a takeaway and theyd be downstairs and theyd come up now and then and have a chat to us for five minutes it made me feel like i was pretty i never thought theyd do what they did to me because you dont think that do you that that will happen she said of one man he asked me to come upstairs and i didnt really think anything of it then he was basically saying about all the things hes bought for me and he wants something back for it then i was saying no like i was kind of saying it in a giggly way i felt like if id said it nastily to him he could have hurt me i tried to say no in a nice way but he just werent having it she said her friend had changed her at that time i was scared of her and i was scared of them as well at first i felt really bad and dirty and ashamed but after a while it had been going on for so long and so many different men that it just became i didnt feel anything it werent like me any more the girl said it just became something she had to do and i couldnt get out of it like once youre in it youre trapped it just became like a daily life she said this could mean having sex with up to five different men in a day sometimes every day but at least four or five times a week theyd arrange a time and theyd come and pick me and her up and wed go to the place a flat or a house and there would be different men waiting there were quite a few men who would be there and theres other men who would pick us up and take us to different places for the other men waiting but there was a lot of men that id only seen once or twice she said that on one occasion she had got drunk and angry and smashed the counter in the takeaway and the men rang the police and she was arrested she said she was scared to tell her parents because i didnt know what the consequences would be from the men because i knew what they were capable of because theyd threatened me during the interview she told police what had happened gave them her underwear and described the places where it had happened when the crown prosecution service decided not to prosecute she said the abuse just carried on i was back in the same position and she the other girl was introducing other men to me again it just started again with different men and more men this time and thats when it started becoming like up to five men a day she said i felt let down but i know that they believed me then in it werent really heard of asian men with white girls nobody like it was just unheard of you think of muslim men as religious and familyminded and just nice people you just dont think theyd do things like that the girl said social services intervened because different men were picking her up and dropping her off from school and she was arriving dirty and smelling of alcohol then i got pregnant and social services said to me that if i dont leave that house the house she was sharing with the other girl theyll remove my baby at birth and i were frightened to go because i didnt know what theyd do the men when she moved back in with her parents she was getting phone calls and taxi drivers were parked outside the house watching it id be getting phone calls off the girl and the men and that went on for months i would not go out of the house on my own for nine months or something without my mum or dad because i was frightened what could happen she said she eventually moved out of the area i just hope now people realise it does happen and how it happens and how they do something about it and justice will be done she added there are so many different men and youre being forced to sleep with these other men for them to gain money for selling you out they frighten you and youre scared of them and obviously thats how they make you do it the girls are too frightened to get out of it in the first place to tell somebody the girl she was staying with and her sister thought they were in a relationship with the perpetrators but its not a relationship theyre just brainwashing you so you think that they love you so youll do what they say i think what they did to me was evil they ripped away all my dignity and my last bit of selfesteem and by the end of it i had no emotion whatsoever because i was used to being used and abused daily she said she regarded the defendants testimony describing the victims as prostitutes running a business empire as ridiculous how could i make it up it was too big to lie about how can yearolds run a business empire of prostitutes its just stupid,2012-05,girl whose complaint police led

nine men have been found guilty of being part of a child sexual exploitation ring involving vulnerable girls five girls were shared by kabeer hassan abdul aziz abdul rauf mohammed sajid adil khan abdul qayyum mohammed amin hamid safi and a yearold man who cannot be named for legal reasons in and around rochdale greater manchester a jury at liverpool crown court heard that the defendants plied the vulnerable girls some as young as with fast food drink and drugs so they could pass them around and use them for sex one yearold victim became pregnant and had the unborn child aborted another gave evidence of being raped by two men while she was so drunk she was vomiting over the side of the bed she later cried herself to sleep the court heard that some of the girls were raped and physically assaulted and some were forced to have sex with several men in a day several times a week during an week trial jurors heard how five vulnerable teenagers were shared by hassan aziz rauf

a judge has praised two teenagers who testified in court against their relentlessly cruel mother as he jailed the woman for blighting her familys lives linda clappison who has shown no remorse since her arrest was given two concurrent terms of months for starving beating and torturing her younger son and daughter according to her children her character changed disastrously after a meeting with a purported fortune teller a trial at hull crown court heard how her son andrew who is now was treated like a dog forced to sleep without bedding in rooms so cold he suffered frostbite her daughter now told a jury her mother had shaved her hair off five times to humiliate her at school for wanting to look pretty both children were made to work long days at travellers market stalls the girl when she was aged under and further punished for things they had not done the abuse went on for six years after clappisons supposed transformation from a caring even overprotective mother into an obsessive dependant of the fortune tellers who hated her own children whom she still rejects as liars judge michael mettyear the recorder of hull told her this change was her loss not theirs adding it is sad that seeing your children in court giving evidence did not in any way melt your heart it is sad that your initial period in custody has not changed you custody is inevitable you have blighted the lives of these children nobody sitting through the trial could have failed to be moved and impressed with them they are the sort of children that any thinking parent clearly would admire they were measured sensible and pleasant it is a credit to them rather than to you that they have survived what you put them through and made remarkable progress mettyear added you say that they and your two older children are liars and you would not consider reconciliation with any of them ever in my view it is your loss not theirs they are super children the judge said that he could not be certain that clappisons change of character was because of the fortune teller liz smith as the children and the prosecutor mark mckone alleged during the trial last month smith did not give evidence and the recorder said i have a rule not to criticise those people who do not appear before me but i am satisfied that something changed and it changed with disastrous consequences something went very very badly wrong in your life and in your mind andrew clappison told the jury that his mother cooked herself hot meals at their home in keyingham east yorkshire while feeding him and his younger sister on chocolate spread sandwiches and leftovers from the travellers who ran the market stalls she evaded calls from the childrens schools where attendance for both of them fell below and fooled a social worker who arranged a visit he said she unlocked my room got my toys out and laid them on the floor she made me come downstairs and put biscuits out and made it look like happy families she forced us to have cold baths which was the worst it was a bad punishment and she knew it was she is an evil person we were treated like dogs basically his sister told the jury in video evidence about the cold baths and added some days she would not give us anything to eat she had locks on the doors to keep us locked in mckone told the sentencing hearing that clappisons older children had left home as soon as they could and were then barred from seeing andrew and his sister until their mothers arrest he said linda clappison has washed her hands of all four children that shows a coldness that is not only unusual in a mother but also demonstrates that she is capable of being cruel clappison stood in the dock wearing a cream sweater with a greyandpink diamond pattern and a blue necklace with her hands behind her back throughout the sentencing she showed no emotion as the case was summarised during the judges comments or as she was taken down to start her sentence,2012-05,judge ha praised two

thank you for raising awareness regarding the crisis facing the womens library womens archive hunts for a saviour may over years ago the guardians mary stott was instrumental in founding our organisation the national womens register the then housewives register our archive is housed by the library and we would be saddened if access to our history was restricted along the lines proposed the worry is that this could be the thin end of the wedge with the collection as a whole under threat can i urge your readership to join the epetition and in sandi toksvigs words save this national treasure pam mckee chair of trustees national womens register when one considers the number of wellendowed military museums two in the city of winchester stuffed full of the celebration of slaughter and toys for the boys the contrast to the threat to the one national archive recording the struggles of women over four centuries is all the more distressing then there is the trade union congress library it is fitting that these two records of the fight for basic rights and greater equality are housed in the same place and no surprise that it is under the cameron administration that they come under threat could not the british library take these two nationally important collections under its wing kate macintosh winchester hampshire we have been coming to the library for nine years using the fantastic collection to get us thinking and talking we are a group of women aged from to and it is relevant to us all the library is a place of history inspiration and love womens voices are important and we women want our voices heard today the building was once a wash house it was important to the community then and it is now like the suffragettes before us we will not give in winnie

vicechancellor of london metropolitan library sets up a false opposition when he says that more outsiders use the womens library than do his own students of course they do because its a research library as such it brings academics and not only academics from all over the world to use its resources and this alone brings great distinction to mr gilliess university distinction alone will not pay the bills but it certainly raises the profile of the institution i was working at the library only last week and was tremendously impressed not only by what it had to offer in the way of holdings but by the efficiency and professionalism of the library staff if lmu cannot see a way to support this excellent specialist library some other institution must be given the chance to do so to measure the profile of an academic library by the footfall of students is a sad commentary on the universitys culture alan shelston cheshire the s poster its really good being a girl which was featured though uncredited in the womens library article on tuesday came out of the work that birmingham film and video workshop was undertaking with backing from channel and the bfi with young people in the black country videos such as girl zone giro is this the modern world what they telling us its illegal for amongst a host of other films were made in one of the most participatory of creative ways devised thus far by independent filmmakers in the uk in a week when parts of the media in the uk have been shown up for their venal mendacity isnt it about time that film and media policy looked in its rearview mirror for positive solutions for the future of a more responsible and accountable media the work of this national movement of film and video workshops from the s and s is sadly neglected by

a twitter user called conservative mp louise mensch a typical soulless rich whore tv critic aa gill said professor mary beard is too ugly for tv a tweet allegedly described the yearold victim of convicted rapist and footballer ched evans as a moneygrabbing little tramp these are just a few examples of misogynistic abuse levelled at women in traditional and nontraditional media recently journalist and tv presenter miriam oreilly who won a landmark ageism case against the bbc discusses media misogyny with nina power a senior lecturer in philosophy at roehampton university and the author of one dimensional woman a discussion of the contemporary portrayal of women laura barnett listens in miriam oreilly the assault on louise mensch on twitter this week was shocking and insidious i know what its like to be attacked by an internet troll ive only been on twitter for two months but already a man and i know who he is has been getting in touch with my followers and sending them lies and distortions about me it was nothing like as bad as the abuse louise was subjected to but its still very disturbing you feel you should rise above it but if someone is trying to undermine your standing and your character then i do think you have to fight back nina power thats horrific miriam it used to be harder to say that sort of thing or it was certainly creepier you had to get letterwriting paper and sit down with your typewriter its much easier to compose something awful behind an anonymous handle mor people seem to think the internet gives them the freedom to say things they would not normally say certainly not to your face online they can just spit their venom in any direction they like and hide behind a screen name np thats true in the early days of the internet people were quite utopian about it it was all about dissolving identities getting rid of gender binaries but the internet is obviously a central feature of contemporary life and contemporary life is in general sexist racist and so on so why wouldnt the internet also be those things mor but why arent the same horrible terms used about men of course men are abused online but not with the sort of fourletter words used about louise is it because people are threatened by strong women who speak out np yes partly mary beard was right and very funny in the way she handled aa gills stupid comment about not being pretty enough for tv beard responded with an article saying men fear clever women but we still live in a sexist world with the recession too i wouldnt be surprised if we see more attacks on women as a prelude to pushing them back into the home or making them suffer the cuts more harshly laura barnett so you think theres a tangible link between media misogyny and the effects of the recession np definitely this happens when theres a perceived austerity you start attacking various groups it comes from the top and filters down into the media mor what shocks me is the apparent media consensus that its ok for samantha brick to write about mary beard in the terms she used in the daily mail brick wrote that women on tv should conform to a certain ideal of beauty but there were about online responses to that article from people outraged she was attacking mary i was really heartened by that and thats not something ive often said about a daily mail comments stream np there are also people on twitter who always attack misogyny and racism wherever they see it depending on who you follow you can still get quite a utopian vision of the world there mor yes im not altogether depressed about the attacks that women get on social media i think we are being pulled back from that by a clear voice from women saying no were not going to put up with it any more lb presumably miriam you feel the criticism levelled at mary chimes with what youve been saying for a long time about the emphasis placed by television on womens youth and looks mor its a great example of what women in tv face we have this ideal of whats acceptable which is to be young and pretty with beautifully done hair and nails i was really pleased that mary fought back its tough because you leave yourself open to even more abuse but you just have to realise we have an opportunity to change things i feel were starting to turn a corner but maybe im an eternal optimist np but its still overwhelmingly white middleclass men in the media who are calling the shots only of people go to private school and yet the media is still filled with them it takes confidence to push a vision to say no we dont want to see only that kind of woman on tv thats class confidence instilled by private schools mor i dont agree i left school at my confidence came through my work tv execs are just entrenched in this view that theyre giving the viewers what they think they want its as simple as blokes fancying young pretty women even when they do use older women they go for caricatures they cant accept that people will want to watch an older woman who knows her subject and it doesnt matter whether she has grey hair or shes leaping around being ridiculous on strictly come dancing np maybe this is tvs last gasp a lot of the interesting stuff thats happening online doesnt have to rely on these gender stereotypes its truly audiencedriven and much more balanced lb thats a much more positive depiction of the treatment of women online than the one we started with np yes the internet is a place for all these interesting things investigative journalism blogs but its also a place where youre attacked but women have to keep going with what theyre doing and not be put off by the abuse mor youre exactly right it would be shocking if a woman were bullied into silence mensch was right to go public and expose these people and with the naming of the rape victim in the ched evans case it was absolutely right that the police moved in quickly i definitely think that outing the bullies naming and shaming them is the way to go np my answers are more structural im afraid were not going to solve any of these things in a society that is misogynistic and racist to its heart its so obvious and boring to attack louise mensch for being a woman why not attack her policies still the internet contains these other images of worlds that are not sexist and misogynistic the internet may ultimately change itself this article will be opened to comments on saturday morning,2012-05,twitter user called conservative mp louise mensch typical soulless rich whore tv critic aa gill said professor mary

there will be women of a certain age all over britain who will have been thinking one of these days ill get at those boxes in the loft in the basement under the bed in the shed and get them to the womens library their archives hold unwritten histories of one of the most paradoxically influential and yet unresourced movements of the th century they are full of personal notes on political tumult minutes pamphlets conversations and encounters with lifechanging ideas it is ironic that at the very moment when there is an embryonic renaissance of feminism the archives of the womens liberation movement are at risk of losing their final destination if london metropolitan university unloads its responsibility for the womens library it is a damned shame that the current custodian sees it not as a national treasure but as a burden not as a resource to be enriched but as an administrative problem the womens library houses a historical archive that is recognised among historians to be unique and it is also a living library a place where history gets made collecting and curating the bits and pieces of the everyday life of movements that have no other home womens movements and womens stories are not warehoused in the nations great archives hansard doesnt record their life and times laura schwartz is a research fellow who spends her days at the womens library quarrying its unique resources for her study of servants trade unions despite the liberation of technology she reminds us that less than of th century journals are digitised people still need access to original sources and records and there is nothing like seeing and feeling the texts and fabrics of another time she has become active in the campaign to save the library and insists that its not just the archive and its integrity that needs to be defended but also the place and the people who work there the awardwinning building and its staff are located near brick lane and like the archive is in the midst of the most ethnically diverse and economically underprivileged populations london met may not be famous but the womens library is it is one of the very few research libraries that have open shelves says schwarz you can browse obscure publications sit side by side with more established material you can make unexpected connections prof catherine halls students from university college london use the library her work focuses on race and empire but she recently found boxes of womens liberation documents in her basement and donated them to the womens library they came from birmingham in the s and documented the womens liberation groups active in that city alone we were involved in all sorts of things from consciousnessraising to children to violence running rape crisis centres pretty impressive really the ephemera captures the life of a movement her boxes illuminate the life of the movement and also the city where it flourished and whose institutions and culture it changed the replenishing of the archives is vital says prof barbara taylor whose book eve and the new jerusalem was an emblematic text of feminist research in the s the womens library has treasures it is supreme not least because it has collections that enable people to see how once womens rights are on the agenda once the gratuitousness of womens secondary position becomes obvious you have continuous movements it is only the tempo and focus that changes in womens liberation we thought were making it up she recalls what we didnt realise was what we were building on thats why the archive is so important lose it and thats when women really do become hidden from history ideas and connections are torn from their contexts and contemporary debates lose their meaning well womens history deserves investment our archives our ephemera and memorabilia need more than a warehouse they need the labourinstensive collecting and curating that makes connections that makes sense of stuff it is an eerie thing to become part of history like many women of my time i assumed that my bits and pieces would be going to the womens library not because im important but because it was it is because its worth it

hannah was raped by her father at her mother also a victim of abuse fails to protect her as a yearold hannah was being prostituted by a pimp who forced her into providing sex for as many as men in a day her school permanently excluded her unsafe at home she moved from paedophile to paedophile she raised the alarm but became too scared to testify her withdrawal led to her being labelled a liar and social services closed the case she is still just each of hannahs experiences would generate an inquiry and media debate a whole industry of opinionespousers regurgitate aspects of her life and spit them out in documents that gather dust in filing cabinets i believe hannah is just one of about two million children in britain today who endure chronic neglect and maltreatment everyone talks about them few reach out to them we are a country proud to host the olympics we have cuttingedge cancer medicine and a system of civil service which is the envy of the world yet we are also a nation catastrophically failing our vulnerable children we are bottom of the league of the wealthiest countries in the world for the wellbeing of children poor children are given free school meals yet during the holidays when schools are closed we provide no alternative we are the nation that has some million children with special educational needs and no help yet we claim we want the best education for our kids we are the nation whose social work departments make unforgiving decisions choosing between a child who has been sexually abused and one who has no food to eat we do all this claiming lack of resources yet we dont even know how much our interventions cost delivered to an individual child because we havent generated the systems to capture expenditure or efficacy in services nationally we comfort ourselves with inquiries almost as if writing and debating a document solves the problem most recently the princes trust produced a piece of research illustrating that large numbers of children are going hungry the truth is as important as these inquiries are all of them are pretty much describing the same set of children and families some charities pick up the extreme cases others attempt to strengthen vulnerable individuals in reality disparate inquiries are in effect describing the same set of clients with complex needs who happen to have multiple problems from addictions to lack of food to school failure to health issues what they need is a holistic approach rather than agencies cherry picking their difficulties for discussion maybe its not lack of money or expertise paralysing our ability to protect the vulnerable i believe the problem resides in lack of belief its just that repeated prime ministers havent known what it feels like to lie in terror on your bed wondering what harm youll have to endure today or to be so hungry that the acid in your stomach feels like its boring a hole through your flesh they havent felt the shame that peels away layers of your selfesteem exposing jarring insignificance in the face of those who have the goods and the power they havent been there where out of sheer fright and desperation you get on your hands and knees and beg not to be shot or burned with a cigarette lighter because youve failed to deliver a stash of drugs between dealers in bed at night between clean soft sheets they contemplate as a child is entangled in night terrors and wakes up to the humiliation of having wet the bed again its the lack of proximity to the abused child that is generating institutional maltreatment no more inquiries with sanitised statistics and airbrushed conclusions which demand little and conceal much let the prime minister have faith even if he cant access belief why not have a royal commission looking at the life chances of vulnerable kids and generating a national vision which all political parties sign up to and deliver free up the practitioners to reveal the unacceptable compromises that betray them

when police officers who rape sexually assault or harass vulnerable victims do reach the court system phrases such as abuse of power and breach of trust ring out from the judicial benches judges and prosecutors have pronounced over the past four years upon the rarity and exceptional nature of these crimes by police officers a senior crown prosecutor expressed that view for instance last year in connection with mark wilkie a bedfordshire constable who was jailed for months last august for trawling the police computer system to access details of victims of domestic violence and teenage runaways the then yearold officer sent the women and young girls hundreds of menacing and sexually explicit messages adding a threat that he would be watching them wilkie pleaded guilty at cambridge crown court to counts of misconduct in public office and one count of theft but despite repeated claims that these cases are rare the true scale of the abuse is not known there has been little or no research carried out and the police service seems reluctant to address the issue publicly the cases documented today by the guardian from to involve forces officers from the rank of constable up to deputy chief constable five police community support officers one special constable one civilian police officer and one member of police staff they have been found variously to have abused their positions to rape sexually assault harass groom and have inappropriate relationships with vulnerable women and young girls or have been investigated over such allegations others are awaiting trial for alleged offences the cases show similar themes the ease with which police officers can access and misuse confidential information a lack of supervision and awareness of suspect behaviour a failure to record and monitor the history of complaints and a trend in which women who complain they have been raped sexually assaulted or inappropriately targeted by a police officer have to battle to be believed the victims run into the hundreds and include female police staff vulnerable women who have been victims of crime and young people professor jennifer brown codirector of the mannheim centre for criminology at the london school of economics carried out landmark research years ago that revealed policewomen had claimed they had been raped or subjected to a serious sexual assault by male colleagues the home office never published the study brown said the issue of abuse of power by officers for sexual reasons was not well documented the questions that need asking are why hasnt this been looked at and how prevalent is it she said if the guardian has uncovered more than cases of this kind of abuse of authority one could imagine there will be many more which are not accessible through public documents in several cases examined by the guardian the crown prosecution service chose not to prosecute when a young woman who had been attending a party in russell square central london complained in that she had been lured to a police locker room in st pancras station and raped by a metropolitan police officer prosecutors did not lay charges against the officer however the officer who was never identified by the force was later sacked after an internal misconduct panel found that he had intentionally had sex with the woman and she had not consented the campaign group women against rape which supports victims of predatory police officers is critical of the decision not to pursue criminal charges among the vulnerable women who have been targeted are victims of domestic violence james formby a then yearold metropolitan police constable was called to a report of a domestic disturbance in september with colleagues while an officer removed the man from the house formby remained at the scene to take a statement southwark crown court heard but in the process he began flirting with the woman who had been drinking and had taken drugs he ended up in the bedroom with the woman where the court heard that a sex act took place in formby was given a week jail sentence suspended for two years and dismissed from the force after admitting misconduct in public office after his sentence his victim condemned the leniency of the term a greater manchester police constable michael fletcher then was jailed last year for months over similar behaviour with a victim of domestic violence fletcher who admitted misconduct in public office at manchester minshull street crown court had sex twice with a woman in july after responding to a welfare call to her home ten victims of the northumbria police constable stephen mitchell who was jailed for life in january for raping and sexually assaulting women he met on duty are now seeking compensation from the force northumbria police said it had paid out to some of the women and was still considering outstanding claims mitchells victims were mostly vulnerable heroin addicts and sex workers and he told one of them that if she complained no one would believe a junkie mitchells case revealed failures within the service to monitor and act upon previous incidents of suspicious behaviour including an incident in which he was disciplined for having sex with a woman he met on duty and accessing confidential information on the force computer it also exposed vetting weaknesses mitchell had been charged with a serious sexual assault before he joined the police which was never uncovered the northumbria force told the guardian that since the mitchell case it had toughened up its own vetting and disciplinary processes and had advised other forces on the same issues derbyshire police turned to northumbria for help during an investigation into one of their constables jasbir dhanda two years ago like mitchell dhanda then was accused of targeting vulnerable women and sex workers and using his position as an officer to make them have sex with him he was jailed for two and a half years in january for having sex with one sex worker while on duty and using the police database to search for personal information about other women he intended to target dhanda was convicted of three counts of misconduct in public office and three counts of obtaining personal data using a police database at nottingham crown court judge michael stokes qc told him you were taking advantage of a woman sexually who you knew was highly vulnerable had real difficulties in her life and was someone if she complained who was unlikely to be taken seriously his words mirror the concerns of those who work with victims of police officers and those of the independent police complaints commission ipcc which highlighted in its report on police corruption last month that the credibility or background of some of the victims eg some were sex workers may have meant that initial allegations were called into question the ipccis likely to recommend in its abuse of power report later this year that forces make more use of covert techniques to investigate and gather evidence about officers behaviour to corroborate the accounts of alleged victims such tactics were used last year in cumbria where detective constable mark fisher then nicknamed fish the flirt by his colleagues was jailed for four years after being found guilty of accessing confidential information on women who had been victims of crime in order to initiate sexual relationships with them the forces department of professional standards mounted a covert investigation after concerns were raised about his behaviour fisher was found guilty of five counts of misconduct in public office the ipcc will also examine failures to record and monitor disciplinary offences during an officers career and whether more supervision is needed in this area the ipcc commissioner amerdeep somal said police personnel who abuse their position and exploit women for sexual gratification have no place in policing the ipcc has investigated some cases of serious concern but the police complaints procedure of which the ipcc is part is mistrusted by some groups who work with victims of predatory police officers lisa longstaff from women against rape said the whole issue of sexually predatory police officers was veiled in secrecy policewomen and police staff wives of officers as well as women civilians have disclosed to us rape and sexual assaults by officers which never went to court she said much illegality and violence by officers is dealt with internally and away from the public and is often not put on their record so no one outside the force knows about it and they are allowed to continue working their way up the ranks inspector kate pain the police federation chair for the wiltshire force where deputy chief constable david ainsworth killed himself last year during an investigation into claims of sexual harassment against him from female staff is one of the few to speak openly about a pervading culture of sexism in the service in the ainsworth case two female staff who made the original complaints have received a settlement and an apology from the force but they are now the subject of an investigation by an external force being managed by the ipcc something their union unison says is an appalling way to treat whistleblowers pain questioned whether the whistleblowing system worked within the police service the police is still maledominated and it is very difficult for people to come forward to challenge poor behaviour and performance because they are worried about promotion to the next rank they are worried about not being supported by their boss and they are worried about being isolated she said that was exacerbated in the extreme when the individual was the second most influential officer in the force what we need is a greater weight of numbers of women in higher ranks to challenge the male dominated approach to policing tackling racism was forced on the police service we had no choice poststephen lawrence and the scrutiny and questions around institutionalised behaviour we have not had that with profound sexism within the police service i think we need to open up the culture and

sexual predators in the police are abusing their power to target victims of crime they are supposed to be helping as well as fellow officers and female staff the guardian can reveal an investigation into the scale and extent of the problem suggests sexual misconduct could be more widespread than previously believed the situation raises questions about the efficacy of the police complaints system the polices internal whistleblowing procedures the vetting of officers and a failure to monitor disciplinary offences police officers have been convicted or disciplined for a range of offences from rape and sexual assault to misconduct in public office relating to inappropriate sexual behaviour with vulnerable women they have met on duty others are awaiting trial for alleged offences though many are never charged with a criminal offence and are dealt with via internal disciplinary procedures the problem is to a large extent hidden as no official statistics are kept and few details are released about internal disciplinary action in such cases by analysing the data available including court cases and misconduct proceedings the guardian has attempted to document the scale of the corruption for the first time in the past four years there were cases involving police officers and a handful of community support officers who either were found to have abused their position to rape sexually assault or harass women and young people or were investigated over such allegations the independent police complaints commission ipcc and the association of chief police officers acpo are so concerned they are carrying out a rare joint inquiry into the scale of the problem which will be published in september the guardian can reveal their work was prompted by the case of the northumbria police constable stephen mitchell who was jailed for life in january for carrying out sex attacks on vulnerable women including prostitutes and heroin addicts while he was on duty despite being the subject of previous disciplinary offences involving one inappropriate relationship with a woman and the accessing of the force computer to find private details of an individual mitchell had not been subjected to extra supervision or dismissed by the force those targeted by the officers are predominantly women but in some cases are children and young people many of them vulnerable victims of crime the guardians investigation has uncovered evidence of vetting failures including a concern that vetting procedures may have been relaxed post during a surge in police recruitment concerns over the recording and monitoring of disciplinary offences as officers progress through their career a tendency for women who complain they have been sexually attacked by a policeman not to be believed a pervasive culture of sexism within the police service which some claim allows abusive behaviour to go unchecked debaleena dasgupta a lawyer who has represented women sexually assaulted and raped by police officers said i dont think any victims are quite as damaged as those who are victims of police officers the damage is far deeper because they trusted the police and believed that the police were supposed to protect them from harm and help catch and punish those who perpetrate it the breach of that trust has an enormous effect they feel that if they cant trust a police officer who can they trust they lose their confidence in everyone even those in authority it is one of the worst crimes that can be committed and when committed by an officer becomes one of the greatest abuses of power the officers involved come from all ranks within the service the most senior officer accused of serious sexual harassment was a deputy chief constable who was subject to complaints by female police staff david ainsworth deputy chief constable of wiltshire police killed himself last year an inquest heard this month during an inquiry into his behaviour he is one of two officers accused of sexual misconduct to have taken their own lives over the past four years in one of the worst cases in the past four years trevor gray a detective sergeant with nottinghamshire police broke into the home of a woman he met on a date and raped her while her young child slept in the house gray was jailed for eight years in may for rape attempted rape and sexual assault many of the cases documented involve police officers accessing the police national computer to gain access to the details of vulnerable women and young people in order to bombard them with texts and phone calls and initiate sexual contact deputy chief constable bernard lawson of merseyside police the acpo lead on countercorruption who is working with the ipcc on the joint report said police officers who abuse their position of trust have an incredibly damaging impact on community confidence in the service there is a determination throughout policing to identify and remove those who betray the reputation of the overwhelming majority of officers in its report on corruption within the police service published last month the ipcc identified abuse of authority by officers for their own personal gain including to engage in sexual intercourse with a vulnerable female while on duty and the misuse of computer systems to access details of vulnerable females as two of the five key corruption threats to the service ipcc figures show that of the corruption cases referred by forces to the watchdog between and involved abuse of authority by a police officer and involved misuse of systems clare phillipson director of wearside women in need who supported some of mitchells victims said what you have here is the untouched tip of an iceberg in terms of sexually questionable behaviour and attitudes the police service in my experience has an incredibly macho culture and women are seen as sexual objects police officers have a duty to steer away from vulnerable women in distress some of whom see these police officers as their saviours it is an abuse of their power to exploit that one area to be examined by the ipcc is whether there might have been vetting failures from onwards during a massive recruitment drive in the police between and the overall strength of the service grew by more than with around officers recruited each year on average six years ago a study of vetting within the police service by her majestys inspectorate of constabulary revealed disturbing failures that had allowed suspect individuals to join the service the report raising the standard exposed more than vetting failures among police officers and support staff the report concluded the potential damage that can be caused by just one failure should not be underestimated,2012-06,sexual predator police abusing power target

a coalition of campaigners to end violence against women has accused the organisers of london of reneging on a promise to raise awareness of the issue during the olympics talks with locog the organising committee of the olympic games appear to have broken down after a lastminute decision to remove helpline numbers from promotional material handed out to athletes despite promises being made in writing at the end of last year that they would appear sarah green campaigns manager of end violence against women said the decision by locog which is chaired by lord coe had been extremely disappointing after publishing research a year ago that linked highprofile sporting events to an increase in sexual violence the coalition lobbied for measures to be included in official information for all visitors including the expected competitors the coalitions report found considerable international evidence to suggest a link between sport and violence against women vaw of different kinds trafficking prostitution sexual assault and intimate partner violence it continued a home office report suggests that reported incidents of violence between partners increased by as much as during englands fixtures during the fifa world cup on the day england were beaten by germany in the football world cup in there were record numbers of assaults against sexual partners in greater manchester for example in a single day allegations of sexual violence and misconduct by male athletes suggest a sexist culture in which boys behaving badly is tacitly endorsed if not encouraged green said that only lastminute negotiations stopped locog dropping all information about violence against women instead any specific mentions of helplines for rape crisis domestic violence or trafficking have been replaced by a general number for victim support helplines which vulnerable women and girls who dont want to talk to the police might need have been edited out she said victim support is not a service where call handlers are guaranteed to know how to refer violenceagainstwomen reports weve told them locog this campaigners fear that a desire to focus on positive messages for visitors is preventing olympic organisers from tackling the issue of safety a london spokesperson denied this the health and safety of athletes at games time is of paramount importance to us within the athletes village we have worked with the police health community and other external professional groups to ensure there is a wide range of medical and pastoral support from highly skilled professionals available hours a day to all athletes there is a paragraph on violence against women and girls in the athletes pack but it is not the specific information promised in a letter from coes office in december the issue has arisen on the news agenda because of fears among womens rights campaigners that the summer of sport could turn into a summer of sexism womens groups they have complained about a fake advert purportedly for durex extra large condoms showing plasters at each side of a womans mouth the image is a pastiche of an advert promoting large burgers durex is providing free condoms to athletes although some of the violence against women during sporting events recorded by the coalition was alcoholfuelled and domestic it also includes evidence of exploitation of female athletes a huge opportunity has been missed to set a new standard for planning to prevent violence against women during a major sporting event said green the international olympic committee has recognised the vulnerability of for example younger women in intense coaching regimes but london is paying only lip service to ensuring such women are safe,2012-06,coalition campaigner end violence woman ha accused

the attempted rape in the latest lara croft game and reports of child abusers using the social gaming site habbo hotel has resulted in a renewed debate about technology new media and violence against women this debate is not new during the mids a version of grand theft auto was released that allowed gamers to regain health and lose money through transactions with women involved in prostitution and the women could be run over or shot on its release there was a similar public outcry and calls for the game to be boycotted and banned each time a new game or form of technology is introduced that enables condones or arguably promotes violence against women and girls the same questions resurface and then disappear namely what is the impact of these games on those who use them what harm do they pose to children and society more broadly and what regulations should or should not be put in place to mitigate any potential harm over the years attempts have been made to control remove or defend an individual game rather than consider it in the broader context in the last months twitter has been used to name a victim of rape contrary to the law entitling rape victims to anonymity a man was convicted of harassing his girlfriend anonymously online by posting explicit photographs of her over the internet a location application introduced on facebook has enabled people to monitor their partners whereabouts at all times men have been convicted of sexually exploiting young women whom they were able to control by buying them mobile phones and then sharing numbers among their group and sexually explicit videos continue to be posted online without the consent of the women who feature in them whether it is stalking through social networking harassment through text messages or humiliation through the posting of videos technology is changing violence against women furthermore technology allows those who advocate and use genderbased violence to come together and share their views often trolling and threatening columnists who speak out against such violence the pace of change has been so rapid that it is not surprising that practitioners and parents who each day are attempting to support and protect women facing violence and abuse from partners peer groups families or people they have never even met are still firefighting in reality the impact that technology is having on the facilitation and endorsement of violence against women cannot be combated by ad hoc responses modern technology also enables protection for women providing a wealth of information about support services such as womens aid the nia project and the governments this is abuse website from mobile phones to social networking sites technology has become part of the way we live our lives both good and bad and this trend shows no signs of receding genderbased violence is now everchanging as one young woman who was stalked by her boyfriend on facebook put it he doesnt need to be near me to see me shout at me or hurt me so how do i get away from him undoubtedly public and professional awareness of the risks posed to women and girls via technology has improved over the past few years but

ten women drugged and raped by john worboys the licensed london taxi driver who became known as the blackcab rapist have lost a crucial step in their battle for damages the victims were told by a judge at the high court in london that their action over the liability of motor insurers had failed worboys was jailed indefinitely in after being convicted at of drugging and sexually assaulting women while working in an insured cab mr justice silber dismissed an application against inceptum insurance company limited formerly known as hsbc insurance uk limited which had insured the taxi worboys used to commit his crimes the judge said he had the greatest sympathy for the women in the light of the horrifying experiences that they suffered at the hands of worboys but said his duty was to follow the appropriate legal principles during the hearing in april edwin glasgow qc acting for the victims said worboys used his taxi as a lure to trick unsuspecting young women into believing their safety was ensured by two things the black cab and the licensed driver it is our submission that the use of the taxi and the part that it played in the attacks that occurred during the course of the journeys was essential and material he said the taxi did not just happen to be at the place where the assaults occurred it was the symbol of security which seduced these young women to believe they were safe the taxi became the place where the women were falsely imprisoned where worboys made up his mind to attack them and where they were poisoned and it provided the means by which the attacks could take place but silber found that the bodily injuries suffered by the women did not arise out of the use of worboys vehicle he said worboys use of the vehicle at the material times was not a use insured by the policy issued by the insurers the judge said it is clear that the fact of the location of the offences of administering the sedatives and of committing or attempting the sexual assaults occurred in worboys taxi but that is not conclusive or by itself of any real potency the injuries of the claimants were caused by the criminal acts of worboys in administering sedatives and then in attempting to or actually assaulting the claimants he said they did not arise out of the use of the taxi on a road,2012-06,ten woman drugged raped john worboys licensed london

aleyda arnzazu stopped practising law the night she returned to find her office had been ransacked by a former client who suspected he may have been too truthful with her about the extent of his criminal activities but neither the mess nor her exformer clients reputation for kidnappings robberies and violence worried her quite as much as what a policeman said to her as she left the office doctora he began politely you should get out while you can otherwise your baby isnt going to be born aleyda who was then eight months pregnant knew a bought official and a serious threat when she heard one so she and her husband borrowed the dollars they needed to get out of colombia risked the long flight and eventually arrived in london via paris in april arnzazu is a member of one of londons invisible communities one of the tens of thousands of latin american immigrants who have come to the uk in the hope of picking up lives that were interrupted by violence at home or of building new ones in a more prosperous country but despite the years of studying and working to transform herself from the daughter of a poor farmer into a public defender or defence lawyer she has been unable to return to the law frustrated both by her struggle with the english language and by the lack of recognition for her qualifications in the uk in she finally resigned herself to the fate that awaits many latin americans in london a shadowy life of early mornings and late nights spent dragging vacuum cleaners and mops around hotels offices and restaurants i had to be brutal with myself and say ill never be a lawyer again here says aleyda i cant do it in colombia any more because of what happened ive got my family and my children here my husband is always trying to find work to survive but when he cant find work do we live off the government until something else turns up for him so i utterly utterly abandoned the idea of being a lawyer her experiences chime with the results of a research project on the capitals latin american population which was published in may last year the report called no longer invisible was commissioned by two charities that had realised the time had come for a detailed study of the size needs and problems of the community the research carried out by academics at queen mary university of london found that londons latin american population had grown almost fourfold between and to reach a figure not far behind the capitals polishborn population of brazilians are the largest national group of latin americans followed by colombians there are also large numbers of ecuadoreans bolivians and peruvians it also found that while the largely young and welleducated latin american population had high employment rates of it was being subjected to serious victimisation with of latin american workers experiencing workplace abuse and exploitation and being paid less than the national minimum wage a proportion times higher than the average rate for the uk population despite their difficult socioeconomic situation however the report found that the latin american populations takeup of state benefits and public services was surprisingly low had never been to a gp in the uk had never been to a dentist and only were receiving some form of state welfare benefit usually tied to work such as tax credits jos luis snchez a spokesman for the latin american workers association lawas is unsurprised by the reports findings he says poor english and insecure immigration status compounded by a widespread lack of awareness of employment law make the community easy prey for companies that pay less than the minimum wage and which refuse to pay overtime or for holidays workers are often made to work hours a day are racially abused and can find themselves victims of physical and sexual violence in some cases people arent paid on time or get their wages deducted illegally he says in extreme cases its sexual abuse some women are told theyll lose their jobs otherwise a lot of the bosses dont know the law and some people have a problem with the language and cant explain whats happening to them lawas which has been working to educate defend and protect the community since the late s fears that latin americans are also being subjected to arbitrary crackdowns by the uk immigration authorities snchez who came to britain from bolivia six years ago says uk border agency ukba officials and police are targeting latin american cultural events in the hope of rounding up those without the correct immigration documents in february police swooped on those queueing for a concert by the reggaeton star don omar and arrested people outside the coronet in elephant and castle although people were then detained on suspicion of immigration offences a home office spokesman said the operation had been a policeled action aimed at reducing crime across london such arrests have prompted lawas and other organisations including the precarious workers brigade to produce and distribute bust cards so that latin americans have a pocketsized guide to their rights if stopped by police or other officials talk to any latin american group in london however and they say the same thing despite a strong cultural and commercial presence in parts of north and south london the biggest single problem is the communitys lack of formal recognition unlike many other ethnic minority communities in the uk latin americans have no box of their own to tick on census or population forms and are left with little choice but to describe themselves as other and then add latin american in brackets carolina gottardo director of the latin american womens rights service lawrs which cocommissioned the report with trust for london believes that ethnicminority recognition is the key to improving conditions for latin americans and to helping them integrate further into mainstream society i would like to see formal recognition for the community she says id like us to be a separate ethnic group called latin americans and id like that to be translated into practice policy and strategy i would like to see the equality act apply to all of us so that we are provided for like any other black minorityethnic community i want us to be visible and i want us to have a voice i want more civil engagement and i want more political participation although she is frustrated by the situation and by funding cuts that are making it difficult for lawrs to help the latin american women with whom it works each year carolina insists the report has already proved massively beneficial to the community on monday gottardo the reports author professor cathy mcilwaine and a lawrs service user will discuss the progress made since its publication at a conference at canning house in london for us as an organisation the situation has changed a lot since the report came out says gottardo when were applying for funding for instance we can talk about numbers and people take us a little bit more seriously we know what to say and we know its evidencebased its also opened up doors to try to push things forward recently weve created a coalition of latin american organisations to ensure that this is not left on paper and that the recommendations of the report are put into practice claudio chipana a yearold peruvian who made his life in the uk after coming for a conference in is a teacher by trade but also a committed member of the latin american recognition campaign larc larc was behind a push last year to get latin americans in southwark to use the census as means to gain real community recognition encouraging them to describe themselves as latin americans on the form rather than merely other although he is desperate to see concrete action chipana like gottardo is heartened by the progress made since no longer invisible was launched at city hall more than a year ago maybe the most important thing about the report is what it has done to the community he says its helped us to open a window on to ourselves so we can get to know who we are a bit better its also in a relatively short space of time given us a latin american forum in which to coordinate our actions others are less optimistic like arnzazu yolanda hernndez is a colombian woman who has been helped by lawrs she is also welleducated having trained as a psychologist before working for an insurance company in bogot and like arnzazu she has found life in the uk far more difficult than she could ever have imagined after coming here to learn english in hernndez was forced to work as a cleaner to fund her studies until she met and married a man with whom she had a son since the relationship broke down she has fought to survive financially and to get the visa she needs to look after her son and continue her studies although she can now stay in the uk for the next three years she is no longer sure that it is where she wants to be asked to describe her experiences of life in britain she abandons spanish to utter a single carefully pronounced word of english disappointed the mental pictures she had of britain says hernndez were no preparation for reality we latin americans see europe like its the bright centre of the universe like its el dorado she says but its not you suffer a lot here jos luis also warns that the workplace exploitation of many latin americans and the governments increasingly hardline on immigration are doing nothing but isolating a community that wants to integrate the vast majority of people here accept us although they dont always recognise us he says latin american people are sometimes invisible because of the work they do but also because of the language but if youre working hours a day its hard to learn the language the greatest enemy gottardo agrees is that enduring invisibility british people identify latin america with salsa and parties and all of that she says and its nice that they think that but i dont think they notice that they have on their doorstep all these latin american people they are completely blind or they dont want to see or just dont see that they are there arnzazu the former lawyer is now the cleaning jobs have left her with fibromyalgia and back problems and arthritis has begun to twist her fingers until last year she was resigned to invisibility and a life of sitting in a chair drinking tea like an old woman but with help and encouragement from lawrs and heavy nagging from her son she decided to have another go he said youre going to end up living in this country without ever learning the language go and learn english properly study so i am and since last year ive also been doing an interpreting course and thats brought me back to life for the first time in a very long time arnzazu feels a creeping sense of optimism and she talks about the future with the same pride and excitement with which she described her legal career in colombia ive got the dream back that i let die after

when annemarie slaughters article why women still cant have it all hit the web this week the reaction was what you have come to expect with any inyourface article about gender polarized vitriolic and most of all extensive there was both stinging criticism and emphatic praise for slaughters piece which argues that women cannot excel both as highpowered professionals and moms in america today having it all as we have been long promised by feminists and as detailed by the new york times slaughters assessment has furthered debate into how moms should handle work and contrasts with facebook execs sheryl sandbergs higherharderfaster school of female achievement slaughter ultimately feels that women can achieve far better careerfamily balance that we can have it all but not until major cultural shifts against phallocentric structures like time macho workaholism take place some people were not very happy however with the articles presentation of feminism that it had lied to a generation of women and grossly oversimplified the tricky realities of working motherhood slaughter wrote women of my generation have clung to the feminist credo we were raised with even as our ranks have been steadily thinned by unresolvable tensions between family and career because we are determined not to drop the flag for the next generation but when many members of the younger generation have stopped listening on the grounds that glibly repeating you can have it all is simply airbrushing reality it is time to talk some reactions american prospects ej graff in a blog entry titled why does the atlantic hate women wonders whether slaughters piece reflects the atlantics alleged women problem in which female gains get presented as dangerous to children to families to marriages to themselves and to men slates lauren sandler writes that slaughter reverts to harmonizing strains of the same old song in blaming feminism feminism doesnt tell us that we never have to compromise america does feminism tells us we dont just have to be a mother or that we dont have to be a mother at all it doesnt say we have unlimited time and unlimited options even before the articles release feministing founder jessica valenti wrote i havent read the piece its not out yet and for all i know is a scorchingly awesome piece of feminist writing but the headlineartcover is just too awful and knowingly plays into the antifeminist cliche the search for worklife balance is greedily trying to have it all what these criticisms miss and here i stray from the feminist party line is that slaughters assessment of feminism might be well right maybe my generation of women has been sold the having it all fiction quips about reportedly outdated language like career woman and having it all aside my female friends and i have all had this conversation with each other ive checked with other women im not so close to and the general shape of this dialogue seems a pretty common trope at first we would express our misgivings with whispered guilt we didnt want to disappoint our feminist forebears with weak concerns about whether we actually could raise kids and have careers as highpowered prizewinning whatevers even for those of us who grew up in very heteronormative households having it all was hammered into our brains as the alternative by someone at some point as was the notion that questioning this or similar beliefs was bad somehow unfeminist when we dared ask whether reaching the top of the career ladder might be incompatible with having a social life let alone a partner or kids the advice typically proffered by role models was to stop being so traditional and fearful and the women who pick more familyfriendly paths for that reason even if it is what they want the choice feminism wanted them to be able to make often got looked down upon by those of us who toil for hours daily full disclosure i was totally guilty of that then reality that awful foil to glib idealism set in and we stopped being embarrassed about our uncertainties when our friends got married we were as overjoyed as we were full of dread because statistically speaking women come home from one job and then work a second job as a domestic women still spend on average an hour a day on housework while males might spend minutes the economist reports then when our friends got pregnant we largely learned to celebrate the birth and eulogize the career because few employers outside academia as slaughter points out adequately accommodate working moms needs from breastfeeding to scheduling babysitters women still tend to spend twice as much time with kids as men according to the new york times as slaughter argued the solutions we had been offered its possible with the right partner if its not working youre not trying hard enough etc have made the language of empowerment feel a bit like blaming the overburdened victims of an unjust system if we find having it all is hard if not impossible the suggestion is that its our fault no the having it all myth is not a symptom of americanism its a fauxpas in feminism which as with any ideology can occasionally neglect realworld pragmatism but the way to dispel this myth is by doing exactly what slaughter says to make true opportunity a reality if that means drastically reenvisioning this countrys employment structure that seems a better place to start than by slamming slaughters take on feminism,2012-06,annemarie slaughter article woman still cant hit web week reaction wa come expect inyourface article gender polarized

of all the gruesome details to have come out in the trial of jerry sandusky the most gruesome of all was not it strikes me the specific allegations of abuse the alleged back massages that turned into oral sex the alleged rape of pubescent boys in the basement of sanduskys home but what was said by townspeople interviewed in thursdays new york times reflecting on the case locals spoke of how it had traumatised penn state folks here will be relieved when it is all over said a sociologist at the university it was a big thing that people want to have resolved said a man in a bike shop let justice be done said the inevitable hair stylist and lets get past it as soon as possible one understands of course that when asked for an opinion by journalists people have to come up with something and lets move on is a boilerplate response to unpleasant news one understands too that it doesnt denote a lack of sympathy for victims in the instance of a child abuse scandal however to say undetected in this context is practically tautological it just isnt good enough if the catholic church has taught us anything its that when child abuse goes undetected for years it has usually been enabled by the culture around it in this case there is the apparent coverup of a university but it is broader than that the passive recoil of those looking on is part of a general unwillingness to talk think about and above all act upon this thing that one is of course troubled by but which in polite society one rather wishes would go away along with the often chaotic young men and women who bring news of it i almost feel sorry for mike mcqueary in all this the assistant coach and not a bad man by most accounts heavily criticised for having had a completely typical reaction when confronted with evidence of child abuse if he had caught sandusky stealing he might well have come under similar internal pressure to downplay it but it probably wouldnt have rendered him actually aphasic that this man not easily shaken as a witness testified was incapable of finding words to say what hed seen in the university showers beyond a quivering indication that he heard some sexual sounds but avoiding rape abuse or anything not couched in morally neutral terms is exactly the kind of avoidance that makes victims feel a sense of contributory guilt and of course shame as the trial exposed it takes years for abused children to come forward if they ever do sometimes long after the statutory limit has expired it is why if they do go public their names are withheld and it is why those already manipulated to feel complicit in their own misfortune are vulnerable to a lingering sense they have done something wrong many of these children became alleged victims precisely because their word would be doubted if it ever came out coming as they did from marginal backgrounds the alleged abuse itself increased the likelihood they would become dysfunctional adults and lead lives which under the scrutiny of a trial made them less reliable witnesses meanwhile people continue to voice shock that such things can happen in the world of college sports so admirable an environment bar the occasional death by hazing and subordination of pastoral care to the profit motive so yes lets move swiftly on in a way these boys now young men presumably have not had the luxury of doing and who while we look away with

nobody asked me why i stopped talking for several months when i turned as a child my normal state was shy but impish with my head buried in a book silence was the only coping mechanism i could conjure i didnt know how else to respond to the molestation of my young body and spirit by my alcoholic stepfather i didnt speak for several months that muteness was noticed by many but attributed to other causes in my twenties i finally told my fragile psyche cupped gently by many as i excavated the lockedaway shame and grieved i came to believe that what happened was not my fault not my shame and not who i was all necessary steps along the path from victim to survivor and now advocate i could have just as easily believed that i deserved to be hurt again and again ending up prostituted or battered i am one of the lucky ones those of us who work to fight crimes against children use the jerry sandusky trial as a platform to say that this happens so much more than you would imagine we use this as an opportunity to appeal to parents to pay attention to look for changes in a childs normal and to understand the consequences of looking the other way while we wait for the outcome of this latest national scandal we are missing the bigger discussion i understand why its an ugly topic nobody really wants to talk about but we must the centers for disease control and prevention now consider child sexual abuse a public health problem according to the adverse childhood experiences data from kaiser permanente enrollees one in four girls and one in six boys are sexually abused it often takes a long time for these children to come forward because for most the abuse occurs at the hands of someone they know and trust children are not emotionally equipped to automatically process trauma are afraid they wont be believed and think they are to blame in order to cope they lock away and often masterfully cover their internal wounds they do sometimes display changes in behavior that are outside of their normal we just dont always pick up on the signals sometimes they are quite subtle former penn state linebacker lavar arrington wishes he had paid more attention to victim in the sandusky case in a heartfelt apology in the washington post he wrote its mindblowing to realize that a kid i took an active interest in during my time at school was suffering right in front of me i will never just wonder why a child is mad i will never just assume ever again i will always ask and let them know that its okay to tell the truth about why they are upset some never tell and may believe they are forever damaged the outcomes for those who never fully process their trauma include lingering selfdoubt depression addiction heart disease obesity and suicide there is hope more than childrens advocacy centers nationwide offer a childfriendly place for children to speak their truths before advocacy centers existed traumatized children were taken to police stations cps offices and district attorneys offices to tell what happened potentially over and over to multiple people this process in and of itself was found to be traumatic imagine being a child thinking you are somehow to blame and finding yourself in a police station then imagine you are a child up on a witness stand being called a liar because your story shifted slightly based on the way questions were asked during the initial disclosure process the childrens advocacy center movement started because we knew we could do better than that today when or cps is called many children across the us are taken to an advocacy center where they can talk to someone specially trained in how to interview children in an unbiased nonleading way law enforcement and cps professionals can watch the interview from an observation room this model reduces trauma for the child and creates a stronger case if it goes into the criminal court system children and nonoffending family members also utilize the services of advocacy centers for healing their wounds whether from physical abuse sexual abuse witnessing a violent crime or abduction the heartbreaking stories told through advocacy centers seem surreal and unimaginable to those not involved in this fight every day the sandusky eight have a long journey of healing ahead of them many following the trial wont want to believe their stories over the word of a man once so respected the defense attorneys will try to find ways to discredit them many will desperately want to look the other way and find another explanation some will accuse these young men of lying for financial gain it is true that there are children who make up the sexual abuse they appear to be disclosing but these constitute fewer than of cases and in almost all they have been coached by a parent to lie during a custody dispute last week and this child sexual abuse is a headline because of the sandusky trial but it will soon go the way of the catholic church and the nations heightened awareness will dissipate but lets not wait for another national scandal to be exposed before we take all this in and adjust to the reality that more children than we could ever imagine face

a new documentary by director kirby dick the invisible war about systemic rape of women in the military and the retaliations and coverups victims face has won awards in many film festivals and recently even triggered congressional response the examples of what happens to women soldiers who are raped in the military are stunning both in the violence that these often young women face and in the viciousness they encounter after attacks in december for instance kori cioca was serving in the us coast guard and was raped by a commanding officer in the assault her jaw was broken when she sought to move forward with her case her own commanding officer told her that if she pursued the issue she would face court martial for lying her assailant who admitted to the assault while denying that rape was part of it was punished by being restricted to the base for days and docked some pay cioca now has ptsd along with nerve damage to her face she is fighting the veterans administration va to receive approval for surgery she urgently needs she has also become a plaintiff in a class action civil suit against the department of defense he didnt rape me because i was pretty or because he wanted to have sex with me he raped me because he hated me she asserts the numbers around the level of sex assault in the military are staggering there is so much of this going on in the us military that women soldiers advocacy groups have created a new term for it military sexual trauma or mst last year there were cases of sexual assault reported within the military the service womens action network notes that rape is always underreported and that a military context offers additional hurdles to rape victims the department of defense they point out estimates that these numbers are misleading because fewer than of survivors report an assault the dod estimates that in alone over sexual assaults occurred in the military prosecution rates for sexual predators are astoundingly low they note in officials received sexual assault reports but only of those reports led to referrals for possible disciplinary action and only military members were convicted at courts martial the department of defense they further record does not keep any kind of military sex offender registry that could potentially alert soldiers and commanders let alone law enforcement to the presence of military sexual predators when women soldiers report their rapes this group points out the often feel revictimized by the process some evidence suggests that rape sexual assault and sexual harassment survivors who have been treated in military medical settings experience a second victimization while under care often reporting increased rates of depression and ptsd mst is the leading cause of ptsd among women veterans while combat trauma is the leading cause of ptsd among men so our women veterans are more likely to be traumatized by a sex assault by a fellow soldier or a commander than by their own battlefield or war experiences that rape sexual assault sexual harassment and their attendant consequences are often risk factors for ptsd isnt the only outcome for women veterans of sex crime it runs even to higher rates of homelessness of homeless women veteran vha users screened positive for mst military sexual trauma in in alone veterans screened positive for mst also in veterans had at least one vha outpatient visit for conditions related to mst the authors note than a high minority of these soldiers traumatized by mst are in fact male which raises many other troubling issues mst costs us tax dollars too last year the va spent almost m on sexual assaultrelated healthcare expenditures i have heard from women veterans of iraq and afghanistan in particular that one serious problem they had which led to health difficulties was that female soldiers had high rates of illness from dehydration they were reluctant to drink even in degree heat because so many rapes took place in the portable outhouses many of these stories involved a culture of male soldiers attacking women in the desert by ganging up at an outhouse with other men or by assaulting a woman when she had stepped into the field to relieve herself the fact that so many women veterans independently described these dangers suggests how systemic and also how necessarily wellknown to commanders such risks must have become i do not believe that major reforms are being implemented in the military to protect female veterans in substantive ways from sex crimes i hope i am wrong instead i find telling the superficial level of concern directed at this issue raised by the invisible war the reaction to the film is an interesting rorschach test for the country revealing its attitudes to women violence sex and sexual violence on the one hand women in the military face rape and coverup as related by the invisible war because of an aggressive patriarchal culture that military culture is a traditional one in this timehonored empirehoned culture war is a manly space women are interlopers and thus fair game or else they are controlled and exploited as camp followers and sex workers the old boys network guarantees coverup for attackers few women are present at the top to change this culture of sex crime and impunity the likelihood of rape being systemic in these more recent wars is raised by the desensitization that all soldiers undergo in order to kill as well as by the kind of institutionalized tolerance or normalization of abuse that is part of the baghram base detention center the abu ghraib prison and other scandals involving desecrating bodies and assaults on civilians rape could be systemic and more systemic than usual in other words because war turns soldiers into dehumanized versions of themselves our especially brutal prosecutions of our recent wars makes that brutality quotient even greater this hypothesis could help explain the very high rate of suicide among these veterans compared with other more lawfully prosecuted wars fought before we abandoned the geneva conventions and before torture and illegal detention were part of americas foreign occupation tool kit the film has been covered widely by cnn hollywood reporter amy goodman and many other outlets that level of media coverage of a raperelated issue is very unusual i have looked elsewhere at the assange prosecution and at the dominique strauss kahn investigation to explore the issue of which allegations of sexual assault are taken seriously by our societys gatekeepers women are raped and beaten up at home every day in vast numbers there is systematic rape in campus fraternities every year and sexual assault in prisons congress isnt holding hearings nor is cnn giving much if any real estate to these phenomena no one is promising major overhauls of these reporting systems so why are these rapes different from all other rapes i would say that the politics of who is involved trigger these atypical responses this broad willingness to look at the issue at least cosmetically is revealing the issue of rape in the military seems part of a cultural tippingpoint there appears something so timely and representative about shining a light on military rape as a symbol of the general trauma americans are becoming aware of among the population of veterans as a whole news reports document that suicide now outpaces death under fire as the leading cause of mortality among vets it also seems that we are willing to look at military rape in a way that we arent at say college rape which is just as systemic because the icon of the military woman is one of the few we have of a woman who is blameless how can our culture imagine a military woman as a virtuous victim and thus more readily look at what happened to her she has sacrificed herself that ultimate cultural marker for female virtue and is facing dangers on our behalf she is not out on her own uncontrolled being wild or asking for it she is rather in a state of discipline under command subordinated to the ultimate patriarchal control system also though this is ridiculous to have to point out but bears noting if you follow the standard trajectory of rape prosecutions military women generally get raped when they do while wearing a shapeless sexless uniform this takes off the table the usual inquiry into whether a woman was dressed provocatively finally there is an impetus for corporate culture to tackle the issue of women being raped in the military or at least make very loud tuttutting noises about it for the same reason that the katy perry video i critiqued got supported and widely promoted by the same media outlets that are owned by or have advertising supported from the corporations that make weapons systems and subcontract war the service industry women who are willing to enlist are a major new profit center for war inc they are a new product line if you like representing new growth capacities new regulations that let women serve on the front lines represent a major boon to those industries that profit by expanding illegal combat zones around the world it is useful for this market if women in war are glamorized as in the katy perry video i analyzed and bad for growth potential if it starts to get a reputation as a dangerous sexually threatening place for a woman to work for the sake of women soldiers who face so many other hazards and spend such long tours of duty away from their families let us hope that the response to the invisible war sparks more than five minutes of outrage and a gloss of concern it needs to lead to actual housecleaning of a very corrupt and dangerous situation,2012-06,new documentary director kirby dick invisible war systemic rape woman military retaliation

online child abuse images are becoming more extreme sadistic and violent with the vast number of images and pressure on resources making identifying new victims increasingly difficult according to a study from the child exploitation and online protection centre ceop the children in these images are getting younger and the offences committed against them are getting more serious and extreme said andy baker deputy chief executive of the ceop centre not only has a child been abused when these images were taken but they are being abused again each time that image is viewed there was a correlation between viewing child abuse images and committing child sexual abuse with of those who had viewed images likely to go on to physically abuse he added he urged police forces to make a risk assessment of every offender not only on the content and number of images they possessed but also their potential contact with children the report indicates the volume of images coupled with budget cuts is putting unprecedented pressure on already stretched specialist units tackling online child abuse images leading to the risk that identifiable child victims of sexual abuse were not being rescued not all images found on storage media are reviewed and classified due to a lack of time and resource to process the large collections of images consequently the chances of identifying new images and their victims are reduced the report says in a perfect world all cases would be investigated as soon as police became aware of the offence but in a time where resource is sparse and priorities continually modified this has become increasingly unachievable it adds baker said we must recognise that the professionals dealing with these cases have a passion for child protection but if there is a small unit and many cases to look at that is a real challenge the report also says people working with children in schools or in care were among the most dangerous offenders analysis of case studies from uk police forces showed that dual offenders those harbouring indecent images and also sexually abusing children were most likely to be between the ages of and and out of work with people working with children the second most likely group to dual offend offenders looking at child abuse images were also likely to have contact with children in the majority of cases studied offenders were living with a spouse or partner and of them more than half were living with children child victims found in online pictures and videos were getting younger with the offences committed against them more brutal said the report according to the study a picture of abuse images depicting penetrative abuse had risen by between and but despite evidence that offenders possessing the worst types of sexual images in many cases perpetrators are avoiding jail terms in one police force only of people convicted of possessing indecent images of children had been sent to prison over a three year period the report warned that although a caution for possessing child abuse images was regarded as unsuitable the number of cautions were increasingprobably owing to the low number of jail sentences resulting from prosecutions for possession in the past year forces reported a total of reports of indecent images from january to december with victims of sexual abuse identified but the report suggested that as the problem was often difficult to detect and not all forces had been counted the true figure was likely to be higher in this study data received from forces identified of offenders who had indecent images had also committed a physical offence advances in technology were also putting increasing numbers of teenagers as risk as they were persuaded to share indecent images of themselves once that image has been sent it is out of your control and can easily be passed from offender to offender said baker in one of the most harrowing examples of cases that ceop have tackled in the report detailed the abuse of two children in care by their foster father and his son after arrest the father who had been a foster carer for a number of years admitted to a range of offences including rape inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and making indecent images of children while his son pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a child sexual assault and making indecent images the father told police that the abuse had begun after he took an indecent image of one of the children while the son said he had begun to abuse the children after discovering the images that his father had taken the father was sentenced to ten years in prison while the son was given an indeterminate public protection sentence the report quoted one child who had appeared in explicit images related to a different case as saying i feel like i had my childhood taken away from me i wasnt allowed a childhood donald findlater of the lucy faithfull foundation a charity dedicated to preventing child sexual abuse said there is no doubt that the possession of indecent images of children is a growing problem but our responses need to include prevention of this behaviour and we need to distinguish those at low risk of contact abuse probably the majority from the minority who are high risk children and families deserve a full and balanced analysis of this problem and of the effective responses to it,2012-06,online child abuse image becoming extreme sadistic violent vast number image pressure resource making identifying new victim increasingly difficult according

nearly a hundred years since women won the right to vote their political and societal power is still only a fifth of what it should be if the most influential space in major newspapers is any indicator as the oped project an organization that aims to diversify public debate recently found a mere of opeds are written by women researcher taryn yaeger looked at pieces that appeared in the new york times the washington post the los angeles times and the wall street journal between september and december and found that while women wrote more frequently than men about socalled pink topics like family concerns and home life they were almost mute on matters such as occupy wall street and other protests or rallies of commentaries international politics and the economy oped writers help to determine what the news is they influence what we as a country contemplate and care about and how we think of the big stories of the day so when half of the population barely contributes to public forums that provoke so much discussion and action democracy falters the people we hear from on the issues of the day effectively narrate the world says katherine lanpher an instructor for the oped project a group that works to increase the diversity of voices in the media opeds arent about writing theyre about power they are a relatively simple tool that can lead to influence and when women dont exercise that power they lose it by being effectively absent from the conversation much of the time theyre not exerting as much influence as they could and should which also means its easier for the issues significant to them to get swept under the rug or decided by people who do not have ovaries take for instance the question of reproductive rights while its hard to draw a direct correlation between womens underrepresentation in the oped pages and the scary way that coverage for birth control and access to safe abortions have come under attack recently it seems fair to suggest that there might be a link after all men control close to half of the dialogue about what it is to be a contemporary female astonishingly females wrote a mere of opeds even on womens issues what this oped imbalance brings to mind in particular is the recent allmale congressional hearing on contraception says anika rahman ms foundation president and ceo whats shes referring to is a february meeting of the house committee on oversight and government reform five male representatives and not a single female got together to voice their objections to a new federal law requiring employers to waive any copay fees for birth control admittedly there does not seem to be much of a gender gap when it comes to opinions about birth control coverage but perhaps that has something to do with the way so many men in america from religious leaders to politicians to yes oped writers are still telling women what to think about their bodies their health and their future its not just on capitol hill however that women often arent given a chance to speak about their issues on television too theyre often shut out during the debate on birth control cable networks called on male guests to talk about it by a margin of nearly two to one lanpher notes lets not forget that women are minority voices in the film industry and on corporate boards too whats surprising however is that even when there are no gatekeepers to exclude them no old boys network to shut them out women still arent piping up enough as evidenced by wikipedia where of the contributions come from men does that mean that women are silent by choice does it imply that theyre so underrepresented in the most important sections of our major news media because they choose not to participate unfortunately that seems partly true a significant part of the problem appears to be that women just dont have confidence that their opinions matter or that they are informed enough therefore they dont bother aiming for the oped pages says lanpher women and other minority voices in my experience are usually the first people to say oh im not an expert in that you could find someone better to talk to what if someone who knows more calls me on it it seems in other words that a lack of selfconfidence is part of the problem but theres an ouroboros element to womens insecurity its understandable if lamentable that they have trouble

sue berelowitz deputy childrens commissioner has highlighted something that many of us have known for a very long time that child sexual abuse and exploitation takes place everywhere by a significant number of adults mainly the research tells us men and that there are a number of methods used survivors feminist campaigners child rights advocates and legislators not to mention the church and other institutions are well aware that child sexual abuse is an everyday event and not something that only happens to certain children in certain places berelowitz was giving evidence to a home affairs select committee on grooming of children in the light of the recent rochdale case the media coverage of that case and of previous prosecutions in which the defendants were all or primarily of pakistani origin was so focused on race that it might lead the public to imagine that all we need to do to eradicate child sexual abuse is to lock up all pakistani men the committee is hearing evidence however that online grooming abuse within the home within gangs and elsewhere takes place and is perpetrated by men and some women from every demographic research by the child and woman abuse studies unit more than years ago found shockingly high levels of child abuse in britain of young women and of young men disclosed in a survey of attending further education colleges that they had experienced at least one sexually intrusive incident before the age of the prevalence study also found that of young women and of young men experienced sexual abuse involving physical contact of the perpetrators were close relatives more distant relatives and other previously known people and only strangers why did the government not act upon those findings why does it take a panic about race and culture to get people to sit up and listen to what children and young people have been telling us for centuries about being raped prostituted and targeted by predators it seems we only choose to know about the most extreme cases those involving strangers who abduct and kill children the least common form of child abuse or gangs located within one location or community but while there are sexual abuse rings and individual abusers who target children unknown to them most child sex abusers are childrens fathers uncles teachers family friends and neighbours as well as sports coaches and clergymen research from found that local safeguarding children boards are failing to protect young people and that the current thresholds for intervention through child protection procedures are set too high that is likely to be because we have yet to acknowledge that the sexual abuse of children is largely carried out within the home and that state agencies have proved to be reluctant to listen to and believe children when they disclose or to fail to provide the tools for the victims to safely speak out the conviction rates in child abuserelated crimes are appallingly low and there are a number of pressure groups that seem hellbent on claiming that children and their advocates dream up false scenarios of rape and torture tim loughton parliamentary undersecretary of state for children and families said last month that however ugly the details of this case i believe we can take some comfort in the fact that it has at long last been brought out into the daylight nothing can undo the wrong that has been done to the victims but this at least is a clear signal that we have made progress rubbish we have made little progress since the cwasu research let alone in the years before it was published i have little faith that anything much will be done now unless there is root and branch reform of our systems with a responsibility to prevent and tackle this terrible assault on childrens human rights loughton said in his speech that our challenge in the months and years ahead is to keep up the pace of progress child sexual exploitation is not an issue which will be dealt with overnight that is right we should have been doing something about it a very long time ago while those responsible have been evading responsibility countless childrens lives have been lost follow

children are being encouraged to take part in sexual activity by exposure to hardcore pornography on their mobile phones the deputy childrens commissioner sayssaid yesterday sue berelowitz told the home affairs select committee that social networking sites and the use of pornography was one of the key areas she was examining in an investigation of group and gang child sexual exploitation her inquiry had already revealed that such exploitation was taking place across the country in urban rural and metropolitan areas it is violent it is sadistic it is very very ugly she told mps on tuesday she said the issue of how social networking bbm messaging and pornography was being used as part of the exploitation of children and young people often by teenagers not much older than themselves was of serious concern in one case boys in a gang were using bbm messages to summon other girls to them to rape and this went on for several hours berelowitz said there are parts of london where children from the age of expect to have to carry out oral sex on a lineup of boys she said she was concerned about the viewing of pornography by young people which contributed to the problem of child sexual exploitation they are watching it and then they are enacting it parents think they know what their child is watching the reality is children can get anything they like on their mobile phones and they are this is affecting childrens thresholds of what they think is normal behaviour social networking sites can be a source of real problems in this area they the perpetrators are sometimes filming their victims girls are making themselves vulnerable by filming themselves berelowitz was giving evidence to the committee which is investigating the issue of street grooming and child sexual exploitation after nine british asian men in rochdale were convicted for grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls the case along with several others in the north of england over the last three years has provided some evidence that street grooming of young girls often from childrens homes is disproportionately being carried out by asian men who target white victims the five victims the youngest was when the abuse began were plied with food alcohol drugs and gifts so they could be passed around a group of men for sex the defendants were jailed for a total of years last month with the ringleader a yearold man from oldham who cannot be identified for legal reasons receiving a year term after being convicted of two rapes aiding and abetting rape sexual assault and trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation berelowitz told the committee the issue of ethnicity was complex she said there was a particular pattern of asian men and white girls as revealed by the rochdale case and others but she said it was a pattern among many other patterns of child sexual exploitation in terms of victims while people have exclusively here talked about white victims i am finding that girls from all ethnic groups are victims so girls from black and ethnic minority groups are definitely victims and they are too often missed out they are really not being properly identified as

brooke magnanti the author better know by her alias the fictional call girl belle de jour has warned that the policing of sex workers in the runup to the olympics is putting their lives at risk magnanti whose memoirs were turned into a television series starring billie piper has given her backing to the campaign group stop the arrests which has written to the mayor of london boris johnson expressing fears that police tactics are compromising the safety of sex workers other signatories to the letter include the labour mp john mcdonnell and jenny jones chair of the green party it claims the raids are part of cleanup efforts targeting sex workers and sex establishments particularly in east london in the runup to the olympics and calls on the mayor to intervene keeping a brothel is illegal under the sexual offences act but how the act is policed varies from force to force sex workers claim the act is being invoked far more stringently in the runup to the games even though there is no evidence there has been an increase in prostitution these efforts are partly a response to the claim made by governments charity organisations and campaign groups that the olympics will lead to an increase in trafficking for prostitution the letter says this is despite the fact that there is no evidence that large sporting events cause an increase in trafficking sex workers claim the police tactics are stopping them from reporting crime last december in the east london borough of barking and dagenham a violent gang carried out a series of robberies on brothels at knifepoint sex workers at the brothels claim they were deterred from reporting the attacks after police threatened them with prosecution those backing the campaign say raids and closures of premises have resulted in arbitrary arrests detention and deportation of people working in the sex industry the letter says this creates a climate of fear among workers leaving them less likely to report crimes against them and more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation it is an inadequate response to sex work and to trafficking magnanti said she was backing the campaign because history suggested heavyhanded tactics against the worlds oldest profession always failed i support the campaign because its time for us to realise no matter how we feel about sex work that making criminals of the people in it is no solution she said historically prohibition has never been an effective strategy and often causes more harm than it stops london is a truly international city and must lead the way with compassion and human rights for all in our society magnanti has also tweeted on the issue calling on others to add their name to an online petition and quoting former olympics minister tessa jowell who has admitted intelligence suggests we are unlikely to see largescale trafficking the metropolitan police disputes claims that it has increased the number of raids on brothels in olympic boroughs but silence on violence a report by andrew boff a conservative member of the london assembly found evidence that there had been an increase in raids on brothels in olympic boroughs the report noted that in the months running up to march police had closed around brothels in newham all data i have been provided with shows an increase in the mets focus on targeting sex workers in the runup to the olympics boff notes however there is no evidence that there has been a corresponding increase in the number of sextrafficked victims in london nor in the number of complaints from residents regarding brothels jones questioned the mets tactics the met seems to be slipping back in its understanding of civil liberties generally but especially in its treatment of some of the most vulnerable people in our society she said londons sex workers need protection not persecution georgina perry manager of open doors a sexworker health project in hackney and another signatory of the letter said outreach work conducted at a sauna and flat used by sex workers had convinced her there was increased pressure from police perry said the met risked repeating the mistakes of other forces around the world every major sporting event sees the same reaction from the police which puts women in danger but there is no evidence base to support their actions the letter was drafted by the xtalk project a grassroots organisation that provides education to sex workers ava caradonna spokeswoman for the project said it welcomed the broad support its campaign had received we hope the campaign will create a space among

the metropolitan police are urging scores of women from north london who have been raped or sexually abused to come forward if they feel their cases were not taken seriously after arresting another detective in its flagship sex crime unit sapphire for allegedly falsifying documents the arrest stems from one of three investigations into failings in the unit which could have left rapists at large the detective constable who has not been named was arrested on friday on suspicion of perverting the course of justice colleagues raised allegations that he had altered crime documents by inserting statements from the crown prosecution service and senior officers to indicate that no charges were to be brought in rape and sexual abuse cases when no such decision had been made the officer was involved in cases of which are continuing and in which he claimed the inquiry was completed each case is being reviewed and at least two women have already been told by detectives that issues have come to light which mean the original decision has now been changed and the investigation is taking a different course the arrest comes less than a week after another former sapphire officer ryan colemanfarrow was charged with counts of misconduct in a public office after concerns were raised about the way he conducted crime investigations and allegations that he had also falsified statements and reports colemanfarrow was dismissed from the met in april it is alleged that he wrote letters to sexual assault and rape victims telling them their investigations had been shelved when no such decision has been made the independent police complaints commission which was involved in investigating both cases is also carrying out a third investigation into the working practices of the sapphire unit based in southwark south london between july and september following repeated concerns about the way it has been functioning the focus on sapphire the mets sex crimes department comes after senior officers claimed less than three years ago that it had been reformed following a series of scandals in which two serial rapists were left at large to rape and abuse hundreds of women scotland yard at the time apologised for letting down victims after the failures in sapphire which were exposed by the cases of john worboys a blackcab driver and one of britains most prolific serial rapists and kirk reid a south london chef who raped and sexually assaulted more than women over eight years both men had been allowed to continue abusing women despite repeated complaints to police by their victims who in the case of worboys were simply not believed by investigating detectives reid who was investigated by officers from sapphire in southwark had been identified as a suspect for a series of sex attacks in and crossed the police radar at least times but no one pursued inquiries into him scotland yard acknowledged in the aftermath of the reid and worboys cases it was facing a macpherson moment over its rape and sex crime investigations and said all the sapphire teams would be taken under the control of the yard centrally to tighten supervision and remove officers who were not up to the job but less than three years after the creation of the new centralised rape invesigation command there is renewed focus on how professionally rape and sex crime investigations are being carried out the latest arrest and some of the colemanfarrow charges concern cases that were run under the command of the new reformed centralised sapphire unit a spokesman for women against rape said fridays revelations did nothing to improve public confidence in the investigation of rape and sexual abuse whether they are lazy biased or corrupt officers who break the law aiding and abetting rapists should not only be sacked but prosecuted said lisa longstaff women come to us asking just who they can go to they do not trust the police and what we are hearing now will do nothing to improve that situation the ipcc said the detective arrested on friday was not connected with the case of colemanfarrow but it is understood the allegations against both officers are similar in that they falsifed records to make it appear that no charges should be laid against men accused of rape and sexual abuse scotland yard said fridays arrest was made at an address in east london and the detective constable concerned worked at the sapphire unit covering camden and islington it appealed for women from that area to contact them if they had concerns over the way their investigations were handled officers from the mets directorate of professional standards were questioning the detective on fridaywhile searches were carried out at two premises linked to him the investigation into the officer began last month it was brought to the attention of the senior management of sapphire that there may be inaccuracies in some of his crime reports a spokesman said the officer was suspended from duty on friday may and due to recent significant developments in the investigation a decision was taken to arrest the officer the ipcc who are running an independent investigation into the allegations were informed of the arrest we want victims to have the confidence that we are here for them will believe them and will conduct our investigations professionally the yard said victims must be at the heart of every rape investigation knowing that lines of inquiry have been exhausted in an attempt to bring offenders to justice any suggestion that an investigation is not up to the high standard expected will be fully investigated and any officers involved in potential failings dealt with robustly colemanfarrow is due to appear at westminster magistrates court on june,2012-06,metropolitan police urging score woman

the recent realisation that the portrait of an unknown woman acquired by the national portrait gallery actually depicts french soldier and diplomat chevalier deon who publicly lived as a woman in thcentury london provides a welcome opportunity to consider the history of gendervariant people and how they interacted with their societies praised by feminists such as mary wollstonecraft the chevalier remained well known long after death british sexologist havelock ellis coined eonism to refer to transgender behaviour ellis lost the lexicographical battle to magnus hirschfelds transvestism and the beaumont society took its name from him but besides the chevalier and leaving aside the indian hijra the samoan faafafine and other nonwestern cultures there have been many others who transgressed gender norms since the roman emperor elagabalus as too many inspirations to contemporary trans people remain obscure to those without a vested interest in finding them here is a purely subjective list of five among the scores of people who have made a marked difference to me a celebration of trans role models achievements if you will james miranda barry cs as separate spheres for men and women evolved in industrial britain responses to those who transgressed them varied wildly victorian authorities saw no motives for men presenting as women besides sexual ones arresting crossdressers in london and elsewhere on suspicion of unnatural offences failing to secure convictions as there was no law against such behaviour by contrast it seemed obvious for those born female to live as men for vocational reasons and there were several instances of people assigned female at birth who passed successfully in careers reserved for men some until death the case of military surgeon james barry who concentrated on sanitary conditions and argued for better medical treatment for women black people and poorer people throughout the british empire is particularly controversial but recent research by hercules michael du preez suggests that rumours about barrys birth sex may have been more than urban legend sylvia rivera there were two flashpoints in s america where trans people

activists rivera and marsha p johnson tireless advocates for people of colour and lowincome queer and trans individuals formed the street transvestite action revolutionaries star to provide those living on the street of any gender or sexuality with food clothes and shelter sadly both died prematurely but the sylvia rivera law project working to guarantee that all people are free to selfdetermine their gender identity and expression regardless of income or race is a fitting tribute jayne county many transsexual autobiographies especially jan morriss conundrum still britains best

recently i tuned into irish radio station fm to listen to anthea mcteirnan editor of the irish times cultural supplement speak about the irish feminist networks sellout conference on activism a wild goose myself i was eager to hear about all the goodly feministing going down in dublin fms colm hayes begins by asking mcteirnan why feminism is a dirty word mcteirnan gracefully dodges the thinly veiled insult explaining feminisms relevance to modern ireland at this point the producers of the show see that they arent getting the level of irrational ranting theyd expected from one of them feminists so they find someone with opposing views to join the discussion enter patricia a listener whose only credential for going head to head with mcteirnan is that shes not a feminist she explains that inequality is all in womens heads before asking her opponent if shes married mcteirnan is stunned into near silence realising perhaps that patricia might not be fully equipped with a rational argument against feminist activism rt brings another voice into the conversation enter oisn an arts student oisn learned about feminism in his critical theories course he explains that the reason feminism is a dirty word is postfeminism are you a postfeminist hayes asks patricia no no she replies im not any sort of a feminist clearly irish feminism faces many of the same obstacles as the movement in the uk namely a lack of popular awareness of feminisms egalitarian underpinnings and an unwillingness to countenance the reality of gender inequality and just like in the uk ireland has seen a resurgence in feminist activism over the last few years however irish feminists have very specific cultural and political battles to fight they are in some ways climbing higher mountains than their british femmie comrades a few facts as it is not possible to choose to terminate a pregnancy in ireland thousands of irish women make their way to britain and mainland europe each year to have abortions but sure well just ignore that will we lads article of bunreacht na hireann the irish constitution still enshrines the place of the woman within the home im not making this up only of the dil is female placing ireland an embarrassing th out of countries in terms of female parliamentary representation austerity is battering irish citizens in many ways but as women make up of the countrys public sector employees it affects women disproportionately its an ill wind and all that one offshoot of the current social and economic crisis is an irish feminist renaissance with dynamic new activist movements poised to bring about social change one of these is the irish feminist network founded in it aims to make feminism accessible and particularly speaks to young people thanks to its use of social media coordinator clara fischer explains the ifns success partly in terms of disillusionment with traditional political structures the politicofinancial crisis has eroded peoples confidence in authorities be these bankers politicians economists etc and has led to a questioning of those in positions of power dublins occupy movement has also inspired fresh feminist initiatives activist gillian barden integral to occupy dame street and now a core member of unlock nama had never seen her gender as a barrier to social participation before occupy she says i found myself in the predominately male world of activism and politics wondering where are all the women being exposed to aggressive gender dynamics was a very upsetting learning curve a womens movement is now blossoming out of occupy with social gatherings leading to plans for feminist political activism barden warns austerity and poverty are not gender blind and neither should we be there are plenty more movers and shakers to mention but deserves particular note founded in the rapidly growing group aims to achieve equal parliamentary representation in the republic by this irish feminist zeitgeist is obviously awesome but why has it taken so long for irish women to demand rights and representation on par with their european sisters ein murray of the national womens council of ireland explains the republics poor record on women in politics in terms of complacency following the election of mary robinson as president in and the rainbow coalition in there was a sense that progress was being made but feminists failed to galvanise hardwon developments this time things will be different minister phil hogans gender quota bill ensures that of candidates in the next election will be female and the council of europe has told the irish government that it must legislate for abortion in situations where a womans life is at risk this is a transformative time for gender relations in ireland and with a growing feminist movement spurred on by the effects of austerity the complacency murray notes characterised the s looks unlikely the prosperity of the boom era made people turn a blind eye to societal sexism but inequality can no longer be glossed over with a celtic tiger sheen feminism stands ready for the challenge of creating a fairer ireland from the uk im watching in respect and

children who have been sexually exploited and trafficked are being put in further danger because of a dire lack of trained foster carers a childrens charity has warned the most vulnerable children are left in residential care or secure units where they are at greater risk from groomers and traffickers according to barnardos taking action after nine men were jailed for grooming young girls for sex in rochdale the department of education has announced new funding for a specialist foster care scheme in an attempt to tackle the problem but barnardos argues that more must be done without a doubt the system is completely failing children in residential care this idea that you can gather large numbers of vulnerable children together in one place acts as a magnet to abusers you might as well put up a neon sign saying get your most vulnerable children here said annemarie carrie chief executive of barnardos a recent report by the charity about sexual exploitation in northern ireland claimed that two thirds of girls in care were at risk of sexual exploitation half of these children were only put at risk after they went into care according to the report not a world away it is a picture that is reflected throughout the uk said carrie it is unforgiveable as a society that we are taking children who have already been badly let down by their parents and family and putting them in a worse situation she said putting children who were being sexually exploited into secure accommodation only exacerbated the problem she added if you were a child who was being sexually abused why would you disclose that if as a result you feel you are being punished and your liberty is going to be taken away following the conviction of the nine rochdale abusers carrie wrote to the education secretary michael gove calling for more funding to help sexually exploited children and the roll out of the current m project across the uk we are at a critical moment here until recently these children were seen as somehow consenting to their abuse and now they are being recognised as victims given the awareness created by the rochdale case this could now be a gamechanging moment she said a spokesman for the department of education said the government had launched an action plan to tackle grooming and had commissioned an urgent report from the childrens commissioner into sexual exploitation and care homes the aim of the barnardos pilot was to create a national programme to help children escape exploitation to give support to and prevent further abuse its difficult painstaking work and we are looking carefully at the impact he said the aim is to develop a national resource which social services and child protection agencies would use to give victims the specialist support they need the barnardos pilot currently has six sets of parents looking after children who have been sexually abused and it is looking for more claire a yearold mother and grandmother and her husband decided to foster a yearold boy who had been groomed and sexually abused for a number of years he was seriously underweight avoiding eye contact shivering extremely nervous

i think it a wellknown fact or at least it should be that women have historically done work very hard work decade upon decade right to the present for wages not equal to men in similar roles in the us my own mother can attest to this fact when she worked factory assembly lines doing the exact job of male counterparts yet making less money because she was a female which is why it is more than a little ironic to me that recent reports are saying american males of all backgrounds because of the recession have been forced to seek employment in areas once thought to be the exclusive domain of women womens work or pinkcollar jobs the kind of work our sexist world socialized us to believe was somehow beneath that of a man when i was coming of age you rarely saw men working as nurses as gradeschool teachers as secretaries or they certainly did not tell anyone that those were their occupations men were supposed to do socalled manly work like construction like being bosses of companies but that notion has been tossed aside because financial times are well tough for many of us men the irony is that while women continue to blaze paths in various career paths including those traditionally held by men it has become increasingly difficult for men to get a good job with benefits whether we have a college degree or not take the case of yearold byron allgood of columbus ohio he set up furniture for events and tutored at his college but realized he needed to make a life adjustment jobs were very scarce when i came out of college and i just so happened to learn about a district that had two kindergarten spots open up so i jumped right on the lead and i found myself teaching and yearold kids then there is yearold ali gilmore of san francisco he previously worked as a web developer and production artist but is now a nurse ali says he wanted a job where he felt he could make a difference so he chose nursing be it television or movies or historical figures like florence nightingale weve certainly always seen the image of the nurse as female that did not bother ali one bit i think that those sorts of jobs just arent presented as options to young males perhaps this has more to do with those raising kids as opposed to the kids themselves but i also think education as a whole is no longer a priority for young males when i was doing my prerequisites for nursing school i noticed how few males there were enrolled in any classes it seemed as though most guys wanted quick fix jobs that did not necessarily require a degree a quick fix for some yes but a growing number of american males recognizing there is no quick fix in sight are opting to explore career possibilities once scoffed at by their sex and as these males enter femaledominated occupations sexism and gender privilege follow men even earn more than women in these oncetaboo fields for males so just because men are entering these arenas does not mean gender equality is being achieved while that harsh reality needs to change theres no denying that gender roles have evolved since the days of our parents and grandparents byron allgood certainly hopes this is the case when most people think of kindergarten they think of gentle women hugging and singing songs with the kids they dont think of men being able to provide the comfort and gentleness that goes along with teaching young learners but according to ali gilmore this trend toward men taking up pinkcollar jobs does not mean there are plenty of opportunities for men in this femaledominated world even as i graduated from nursing school it took me a year and a half to find a job nursing i actually went back to web development for a while what im saying is its tough out there even for nurses however maybe just a little less tough than other occupations tough yes with little letup in this recession in view i think we can expect more men to march in the direction of pinkcollar jobs and come to feel the way byron allgood does about their new lives that was a huge part of staying in kindergarten for me once i got a job and got my foot in the door i considered moving on to higher grade but by being a male kindergarten teacher i made myself a rare asset to my field,2012-06,think wellknown fact least woman historically done work hard work decade upon decade right present wage equal men similar role u mother attest fact worked factory assembly line exact job male counterpart yet making less money wa female little ironic recent report saying american male background recession forced seek employment area thought

the uns special rapporteur on torture has made a formal approach to the us government over a specialneeds school near boston that inflicts electric shocks on autistic children as a form of behavioural control juan mendez has told the guardian that he has opened discussions with the us mission to the un in geneva as a first step towards investigating the school the rapporteur plans to contact the us state department and has the option of reporting the matter to the un human rights council mendez said he was very concerned about the use of electric shocks which are inflicted on autistic children through pads applied to their skin the use of electricity on anyones body raises the question of whether this is therapeutic or whether it inflicts pain and suffering tantamount to torture in violation of international law he added the judge rotenberg center in canton massachusetts is believed to be the only institution in the world in which disabled and disturbed children are subjected to electric shocks to in a system known called aversive therapy the shocks are generated by a device known as a ged which children are made to carry hours a day in backpacks or around their waist about half of the schools students carry the generators that are triggered by care assistants using remotecontrolled zappers which then send a electric charge to skin pads on the childrens arms and legs the guardian is one of very few media organisations that have witnessed the school in operation in recent weeks opposition to the controversial electroshock treatment has reached fever pitch a rally demanding the end of the practice was due to be held outside the massachusetts state house at noon saturday followed by a march at the jrc itself at pm the spotlight that the un rapporteur is putting on the school is given added poignancy by the fact that mendez was himself subjected to torture by electric shock at the hands of the buenos aires police in he was abused with electric prods i feel very strongly that electricity applied to a persons body creates a very extreme form of pain there a lot of lingering consequences including mental illness that can be devastating mendez said this is the second time the un has intervened over the school mendezs predecessor as torture rapporteur manfred nowak also called for a federal us investigation outrage over the school was taken to a new level in april when for the first time the public was able to see video footage of a child being subjected to the shocks the video played in a boston courtroom showed then yearold andre mccollins being given shocks over a sevenhour period in in the video andre can be heard screaming and shouting help me help me he is restrained with belts face down on a board as the electricity is discharged into his body andres mother cheryl mccollins who was suing the school for mistreating her son told the court that when she visited him soon after he was given the zaps i couldnt turn andres head to the left or to the right he was just staring straight he didnt blink the mccollins family reached a settlement with the jrc which claimed it was merely following a judgeapproved treatment plan for andre but in the wake of the video calls for the electric shocks to be banned have grown we are closer now to closing down the jrc than we have ever been said ari neeman president of the autistic self advocacy network that is run by and for autistic adults this issue is deeply personal this could be happening to us laurie ahern of the campaign disability rights international that has opposed the treatment for many years said aversive therapy amounted to a horrific form of torture what happened to andre in that video is worse than anything i have ever seen done to a prisoner of war or a political victim around the world she said m on lawyers fees as public anger builds there are mounting political moves to restrict the schools activities a bill that would ban aversive therapy has already passed the massachusetts state senate and is now being considered by the house a leading proponent of the bill massachusetts senator brian joyce said in a live chat on the canton patch website that for too many years we have failed our moral obligation to defend these defenseless children he said that the school had managed for decades to continue its controversial practice through a combination of secrecy and legal threats spending m on lawyers fees between and joyce was due to be speaking at saturdays statehouse rally as was gregory miller a former assistant at the jrc who himself administered electric shocks but grew to be sickened by the procedure miller organised a petition on changeorg calling for an end to the shocks that has attracted more than signatures when i started at the school i was told that students behaviour was so severe they had to be shocked in order to save their lives but i had to shock students for very minor things like tearing up a paper cup or standing up to give a hug he added that some students who werent able to speak out about what was happening to them were getting or shocks a day in a statement the jrc said that it uses shock treatments for the most difficult behaviourally involved students in the country the shocks were only administered when other therapies were exhausted and with the approval of parents and the courts the staff at jrc is committed to serving these students when no other facility can or will and finding the best ways to manage their behaviours to a level where they are no longer causing severe injury and pain to themselves can learn and spend time with their family and friends the jrc was founded years ago the use of electric shocks on autistic kids was devised by matthew israel an ardent follower of behaviouralism that believes humans can be remoulded through punishments and rewards israel was forced to step down last year after he was found to have ordered the destruction of video evidence relating to a case in which a boy aged was shocked times the zaps which occurred over a threehour period were applied by assistants acting upon instructions received it was later discovered from a hoax phone call elizabeth stringer keefe an autism expert at lesley university in massachusetts said that one reason the school had survived so long was that israel claimed inaccurately that there were no alternatives to aversive therapy for cases of severe autism the field moved away from this position years ago towards positive behavioural support she said,2012-06,un special rapporteur

who is a rapist thats a question our societies began to struggle with as far back as when we determined that women had the right to refuse sex more often than not we just say who isnt a rapist deuteronomy says hes not a rapist if you didnt scream some judicial systems say hes not a rapist if hes your husband and increasingly few say hes not if he marries you right after cops prosecutors juries and members of the public who eventually get called to serve on them have myriad of unwritten rules about who isnt a rapist famous men men whom you kissed that night men with whom you or anyone previously had consensual sex men who were going to pay you for it men who are too attractive to have to resort to coercion men who didnt have weapons men who havent ever raped anyone else and seem too old to start now and the list goes on but this week a user on the social media site reddit asked fellow users to share their experiences as perpetrators of sexual assault the end result was part massconfessional and part exhibitionist spectacle in which some users offered one another virtual absolution in the same way society often already does but in between the remorseful paeans and the sociopathic howto guides an existential truth emerged many rapists look and act like everyone else almost right up until the moment they start raping its a truth that many sexual assault survivors have already been forced to confront and one at least as many survivors know the rest of society hasnt yet wrapped its head around for all that weve moved modestly beyond the idea that a rapist is the transient in a back alley or the creepy guy eyeing your unattended drink in a bar or the angry sexually frustrated predator we still believe that we can tell who the bad people are we believe that rapists are defined by their criminality and that people whose lives arent defined by that criminality be they sports stars coaches international leaders whistleblowers redefining journalism in the digital age the creators of popular movies or songs or just the nice fatherly guy next door well they cant be rapists life and people are more complicated than that the cute guy who let you cuddle up next to him during a movie becomes the man who crudely forces your legs apart and enjoys himself more when you struggle the friend who you let stay in your extra bed becomes the man who shoves his fingers in you when youre too drunk to know the hookup buddy becomes the man who ignores your boundaries and your nos and forces open your clamped legs the guy in your group of friends who you were laughing with half an hour ago becomes the man who walks into your room and molests you when youre asleep even turning on the light to inspect his work the older guy who was nice to you in the afternoon becomes the man who shows up in the middle of the night and pins you down in your own bed with his body your loving boyfriend with whom you consent to sex becomes a man who clamps his hand over your mouth to stop you from screaming as he anally rapes you while in a trance some of them stop when you cry when they look at your face and see you feel youre about to be raped when you say no when you push at them screaming others dont some go to jail but most of them dont some grow up and marry women who dont know what they did have children they want to protect from men like them smile at you at pta meetings or even show up at your door years later to look over some storm damage on behalf of your insurance company some stop some learn better some spend years hating themselves others brag about it or selfpleasure while remembering it but one thing they all have in common none of them looked or acted like rapists and few in their lives unless they were reported suspects they were in many cases they arent the violent sexual predators youve been taught to expect and guard against they arent always sadists who enjoy it more because it hurts though they exist too but at some point they all just stop caring how you feel because that isnt remotely necessary for it to feel good to them in some way theyre reading off the ageold script sex is something you have that they want and your resistance is just a barrier to push past or the lack of resistance even if youre incapacitated is acquiescence if theres one other lesson to be taken away from the morass of that discussion it is that theres no amount of warning women not to leave the metaphorical keys on the hoods of our cars thats going to end rape for every man who admitted to plying victims with alcohol another simply held a woman down for every man who professed to being so aroused by a woman that he had to force her another admitted to molesting a woman who was unconscious for every man that went after a nearstranger another hurt someone to whom hed been close the people who need to be educated about rape are our men and boys they need to learn that sex isnt a zerosum game its not keepaway or capturetheflag its not a thing they do with their genitals to the genitals of another person at whom they dont look let alone see it is something they can engage in and share with another person and if the other person the whole of other person isnt sharing in the sexual act for whatever reason at whatever moment then its not sex thats when it becomes rape and no matter what you look like or what other good youve done in your life youre then a rapist and if the men who admitted to it on reddit are any guide no matter how they justified it in the moment they know it,2012-07,rapist thats

harriet harman has decreed that you cannot be a feminist and a conservative but sisters we will not take this lying down with our blue rosettes she is wrong both historically and politically indeed this statement unequivocally demonstrates her abandonment of feminism she has decided to sacrifice it at the altar of socialism by attacking conservative women she is too much of an old hand to truly believe this she is deliberately using her feminist credentials to launch an attack that she doesnt believe in but which polishes her reputation as the hard woman of labour the truth is socialists came rather late to the feminist movement anyone who saw the film made in dagenham will have seen the accurate portrayal of trade union leaders determined to keep womens pay at unequal levels the trade union movement fought for mens rights and were deeply suspicious of working women the working mens clubs did not welcome women the labour party was slow to promote women sure once it worked out the electoral importance of women and the value of twice as many subs for the union movement it welcomed them but there is no natural alliance in fact the need for allwomen shortlists for selection of labour mps to ensure sufficient numbers of women on their green benches reveals the certainty that labour members wont select women if a selection panel is prejudiced against women that prejudice needs to be addressed and that is how the conservative party is making progress with more women mps the answer is not to ignore any sexism and go straight to imposing women without an open competition with men it is illiberal and counter to any argument for equality equality and choice are at the heart of feminism like human rights these are not party political issues take the first suffragettes emmeline pankhursts instincts were more conservative than socialist and she disapproved of her daughter sylvias position when she embraced socialism and pacifism together actively opposing the first world war in fact she and her other daughter christabel founded their own womens party their militant fight for votes made them feminist heroines not socialist ones at the core of harmans comment is her view that only socialism can empower women what she fails to acknowledge are the different political philosophies of socialism and conservatism that inform how to improve womens lives give a woman a labour prime minister and she can live on welfare just give a woman a conservative prime minister and we will increase opportunities for her to get jobs for children to get a good education for hardworking families to improve their lives for young women to get apprenticeships and for entrepreneurial women to start businesses conservative feminism is about boosting women to their full potential we are optimistic and ambitious for women labours policy towards women is still about the state protecting them they dont believe women can achieve for themselves what patronising rubbish one liberalconservative woman who might be surprised to find she doesnt qualify as a feminist is germanys chancellor angela merkel the most powerful woman in politics the most important politician in europe and leader of the christian democrat group in germany poor merkel apparently not a feminist after all the labour party no longer seems interested in how to improve womens lives instead it uses the womens issue as a political weapon against the government making crude calculations about effects of deficit reduction and ignoring the improvements on the other side in parliament we conservative women mps often find we outnumber the labour ones on policy debates that are specifically about women at a recent debate on female genital mutilation led by our conservative colleague jane ellison mp we achieved a significant breakthrough when the minister agreed to implement health passports for at risk children travelling abroad not a single labour mp attended if the labour party want to be relevant to womens lives they need to do more than throw names at conservative women what action are they taking as the suffragettes said deeds not words,2012-07,harriet harman ha decreed feminist

in the face of great odds keir starmer and his team of prosecutors have convicted more men of violent crime against women in the past four years in the uk with a increase in cases to a record last year those odds include a government that has cut the crown prosecution service cps budget by public pronouncements from ministers that not all rape is raperape and an early proposal admittedly quickly dropped that women who accuse men of rape are named and somehow further shamed it may seem odd to welcome an increase in crime but when set against the fact that every year in the uk more than one million women suffer domestic abuse more than are sexually assaulted and women are raped according the british crime survey the gulf between actual crime and reported crime is surely even odder as starmer said in his remarks on the latest report on violence against women we face a situation where fewer than one in four people who suffer abuse at the hands of their partner and only around one in women who experience serious sexual assault report it to the police such statistics have led to the oftreported shocker that of all rapes committed only end in a conviction of rape while others have wrung their hands about the problem of his word against hers or suggested that emotional attachment means women are likely to forgive and forget starmer and his team have quietly tried to deal with ways of increasing public confidence in reporting abuse and they have achieved results some prosecutors were trained as domestic violence specialists with more than as experts in rape cases then there were specialists on socalled honourbased violence prostitution and trafficking stalking cybercrimes female genital mutilation and child sexual exploitation such as grooming the strategy was about informing the opinion of those who speak to victims encouraging them to tell the truth and more importantly to speak out starmers words during a typically robust interview with john humphrys on radio s today programme on monday morning caught my attention asked whether the now infamous rochdale case was really about different culture attitudes of the mainly asian men who abused these girls starmer admitted that this could be an issue but not the main one this he said were the assumptions made about these very very vulnerable individuals who were just not thought credible by prosecutors young desperate for affection and therefore asking for it they were repeatedly raped by older men for perhaps a drink or drag of a cigarette starmer is to chair a separate group later this year looking at the rochdale prosecutions to learn lessons from the case and theres more the cps has highlighted gang membership and female genital mutilation which has never been subject to prosecutions in this country despite the fact that campaigners believe that tens of thousands of young girls are being cut in this way in the uk every year his decision to tackle the myths and stereotypes surrounding sexual violence and the assumptions made about the kind of women bringing allegations of assault has brought about the biggest single difference in the cpss attitude and while this often fumbling government can seem the worst villain we all share our part of the blame for a culture in which a victim of sexual violence is often blamed in the media and the pub either for her behaviour or her

domestic violence conviction rates are at their highest after a fouryear campaign by prosecutors to tackle violence against women and girls the director of public prosecutions will announce on monday the overall number of prosecutions for violence against women which include rape sexual assault and harassment has risen to cases a year keir starmer will say in an assessment of the strategy to improve the way prosecutors tackle cases of violence against women and girls starmer will reveal that in the past year the crown prosecution service has reported its highest conviction rate for domestic violence in cases of domestic violence referred to prosecutors the conviction rate stands at compared to in rape convictions have also improved in cases charged by prosecutors the conviction rate has risen from in to in this contrasts starkly with the oftenquoted rape conviction rate of around for england and wales which relates to the percentage of allegations of rape reported to the police that result in a conviction in his speech starmer will say a lot has changed in recent years we now have prosecutors who specialise in these types of crimes we have introduced training and guidance and we have improved the way we engage with communities none of that would have been possible without the support of the womens organisations prosecutors and criminal justice colleagues starmer who as dpp has made tackling violence against women and girls a priority says more than offenders are being brought to justice the latest statistics from the british crime survey show that every year in the uk more than million women suffer domestic abuse more than are sexually assaulted and are raped but fewer than one in four people who suffer abuse by their partner and fewer than one in women who experience serious sexual assault report it to the police that makes it all the more important that when such a crime is reported it is dealt with professionally effectively and with understanding said starmer in the past all too often the criminal justice system failed in this respect but that is changing historically cases of violence against girls women including rape and sexual assault have had high rates of attrition as victims who are afraid to give evidence withdraw or drop out of prosecutions for other reasons but starmer says this is improving as a result of the policy to focus on violence against women a snapshot in showed that of all domestic violence prosecutions were discontinued by this rate had reduced to starmer adds that the production of stronger cases against defendants has led to more guilty pleas saving women the trauma of giving evidence guilty pleas have increased from to for all cases of violence against women and from to for rape cases the fouryear violence against women strategy adopted by the cps has involved all prosecutors in england and wales receiving receive training in how to tackle domestic violence cases and chief prosecutors selected to champion the strategy in each region a spokeswoman for refuge welcomed the cps report she said refuge remains concerned that the numbers of perpetrators prosecuted and subsequently convicted represents the tip of an iceberg the successfully prosecuted nationally barely scratches the surface we are concerned that the british crime survey tells us that there are an estimated million women who experience domestic violence each year in the uk some of these cases may not be reported to the police for a number of reasons including women being too frightened to come forward this leaves a huge number of domestic abuse cases that never reach the police and therefore the courts,2012-07,domestic violence conviction rate highest fouryear campaign prosecutor tackle

by now surely everyone knows the case of the eight men convicted of picking vulnerable underage girls off the streets then plying them with drink and drugs before having sex with them a shocking story but maybe you havent heard because these sex assaults did not take place in rochdale where a similar story led the news for days in may but in derby earlier this month fifteen girls aged to many of them in care were preyed on by the men and though they were not working as a gang their methods were similar often targeting children in care and luring them with among other things cuddly toys but this time of the eight predators seven were white not asian and the story made barely a ripple in the national media of the daily papers only the guardian and the times reported it there was no commentary anywhere on how these crimes shine a light on british culture or how middleaged white men have to confront the deep flaws in their religious and ethnic identity yet thats exactly what played out following the conviction in may of the asian sex gang in rochdale which made the front page of every national newspaper though analysis of the case focused on how big a factor was race religion and culture the unreported story is of how politicians and the media have created a new racial scapegoat in fact if anyone wants to study how racism begins and creeps into the consciousness of an entire nation they need look no further imagine you were living in a town of people the size of say penzance in cornwall and one day it was discovered that one of its residents had been involved in a sex crime would it be reasonable to say that the whole town had a cultural problem that it needed to address the scourge that anyone not doing so was part of a conspiracy of silence but the intense interest in the rochdale story arose from a january times scoop that was based on the conviction of at most british pakistanis out of a total uk population of million just one in one person per penzance make no mistake the rochdale crimes were vile and those convicted deserve every year of their sentences but where amid all the commentary was the evidence that this is a racial issue that theres something inherently perverted about muslim or asian culture even the child protection and online protection centre ceop which has also studied potential offenders who have not been convicted has only identified asian gangs of in total and asian individuals and they are spread across the country but despite this a new stereotype has taken hold that a significant proportion of asian men are groomers and the rest of their communities know of it and keep silent but if it really is an asian thing how come indians dont do it if its a pakistani thing how come an afghan was convicted in the rochdale case and if its a muslim thing how come it doesnt seem to involve anyone of african or middle eastern origin the standard response to anyone who questions this is face the facts all those convicted in rochdale were muslim well if one case is enough to make such a generalisation how about if all the members of a gang of armed robbers were white or cybercriminals or child traffickers all three of these have happened would we be so keen to face the facts and make it a problem the whole white community has to deal with would we have articles examining what it is about britishness or christianity or europeanness that makes people so capable of such things in fact penzance had not just one paedophile but a gang of four they abused girls some as young as five and were finally convicted two years ago all were white and last month at a home affairs select committee deputy childrens commissioner sue berelowitz quoted a police officer who had told her that there isnt a town village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited whatever the case we know that abuse of white girls is not a cultural or religious issue because there is no longstanding history of it taking place in asia or the muslim world how did middleaged asian men from tightknit communities even come into contact with white teenage girls in rochdale the main cultural relevance in this story is that vulnerable often disturbed young girls regularly out late at night often end up in lateclosing restaurants and minicab offices staffed almost exclusively by men after a while relationships build up with the men offering free lifts andor food for those with a predatory instinct sexual exploitation is an easy next step this is an issue of what men can do when away from their own families and in a position of power over badly damaged young people its a story repeated across britain by white and other ethnic groups where the opportunity arises some men will take advantage the precise method and whether its an individual or group crime depends on the particular setting be they priests youth workers or networks on the web despite all we know about racism genocide and ethnic cleansing the rochdale case showed how shockingly easy it is to demonise a community before long the wider public will believe the problem is endemic within that racereligion and that anyone within that group who rebuts the claims is denying this basic truth normally one would expect a counterargument to force its way into the discussion but in this case the crimes were so horrific that rightthinking people were naturally wary of being seen to condone them in fact the reason i am writing this is that i am neither asian nor muslim nor pakistani so i cannot be accused of being in denial or trying to hide a painful truth but i am black and i know how racism works and more than that i have a background in maths and science so i know you cant extrapolate a tiny flawed set of data and use it to make a sweeping generalisation i am also certain that if the tables were turned and the victims were asian or muslim we would have been subjected to equally skewed expert commentary asking what is wrong with how muslims raise girls why are so many of them on the streets at night shouldnt the community face up to its shocking moral breakdown while our media continue to exclude minority voices in general such lazy racial generalisations are likely to continue even the story of a single asian man acting alone in a sex case made the headlines as in derby this month countless similar cases involving white men go unreported we have been here before of course in the s west indian men were labelled pimps luring innocent young white girls into prostitution by the s and s they were vilified as muggers and looters and two years ago channel ran stories again based on a tiny set of data claiming there was an endemic culture of gang rape in black communities the victims werent white though so media interest soon faded it seems that these stories need to strike terror in the heart of white people for them to really take off what is also at play here is the inability of people when learning about a different culture or race to distinguish between the aberrations of a tiny minority within that group and the normal behaviour of a significant section some examples are small in number but can be the tip of a much wider problem eg knife crime which is literally the sharp end of a host of problems affecting black communities ranging from family breakdown to poverty to low school achievement and social exclusion but in asia pakistan or islam there is no culture of grooming or sex abuse any more than there is anywhere else in the world so the tiny number of cases have no cultural significance which means those who believe it or perpetuate it are succumbing to racism much as they may protest exactly the same mistake was made after when the actions of a tiny number of fanatics were used to cast aspersions against a billionstrong community worldwide motives were questioned are you with us or the terrorists how fundamental are your beliefs can we trust you imagine if after anders breiviks carnage in norway last year which he claimed to be in defence of the christian world british people were repeatedly asked whether they supported him lumped together in the same white religious group as the killer and constantly told they must renounce him or explain why we should believe that their type of christianity even if they were nonbelievers is different from his its nothing to do with me most people would say but somehow that answer was never good enough when given by muslims over alqaida and this hectoring was selfdefeating because it caused only greater alienaton and resentment towards the west and in particular its foreign policies ultimately the urge to vilify groups of whom we know little may be very human and helps us bond with those we feel are like us but if we are going to deal with the world as it is and not as a cosy fantasyland where our group is racially and culturally supreme we have to recognise when sweeping statements are false and if we truly care about the sexual exploitation of girls we need to know that we must look at all communities across the whole country and not just at those that play to a smug sense of superiority about ourselves,2012-07,surely everyone know case eight men convicted picking vulnerable underage girl street plying drink drug sex shocking story maybe havent heard sex assault take place

women who say they were let down by the metropolitan police when they reported rape and sexual assault including two who were attacked by the taxi driver john worboys are suing the force the women are attempting to establish that police who fail to investigate such crimes properly are violating victims human rights if successful the claims would be landmark cases which would confirm that the state has a legal duty to investigate rape and sexual assault thoroughly and competently the womens lawyers said they added that such a ruling would also help future victims and give committed officers a legal basis from which to argue for more resources in an independent police complaints commission ipcc inquiry found that worboys remained free to prey on women because officers made serious mistakes and failed to take victims seriously five met officers were disciplined worboys was jailed indefinitely in after being found guilty of charges of drugging and sexually assaulting women in one case raping his victim he has been linked to sex crimes but is suspected of being responsible for more than attacks one of the claimants who was assaulted by worboys said she still had nightmares about what happened when she went to police it rings in my ears the officer saying a black cab driver just wouldnt do it she said it felt like they didnt want to know in my dreams im screaming why wont you believe me they need to sort this now and give me some peace of mind i need closure four officers were disciplined over the case of the third woman bringing legal action who was when she told police she had been raped the defendant was acquitted and the ipcc said there were significant errors in an investigation that fell far short of what the woman had a basic right to expect an internal inquiry into the case managed by the commission described a department that was understaffed underskilled and overburdened the womans mother said we have to do this because we dont think they should be allowed to get away with it its never been about money its just the injustice and the fact we dont want it to happen to someone else the women are seeking a declaration that their human rights were breached all three have previously received apologies from the met over the way their cases were handled but their lawyers said they had been caused further distress the forces attempt to block the cases by arguing they have been brought too late harriet wistrich who represents the worboys claimants said she found the mets approach incomprehensible they have been roundly criticised for extremely serious failings in their investigation yet they are using public money to defend a case causing further distress to my clients she said mike schwartz a human rights lawyer from bindmans said the governments obligations to protect its citizens rights extend beyond simply criminalising sexual assaults and rapes the police must properly investigate and prosecute serious allegations the courts recognise that rights are meaningless unless they are enforceable last month the court of appeal ruled that the case relating to the allegations should proceed despite being out of time arguments are ongoing about whether worboys victims claims should be heard debaleena dasgupta who is representing the claimant in the case said our clients want acknowledgment for what has been done to them and acknowledgment that it was wrong how much better will they feel if after all they have been through they know that once that declaration is made all future victims can rely on the judgment for accountability the judgments would also provide clarification for the police so they know their duties and can take steps to improve their work for those officers determined to do a good job but obstructed by a lack of will from others this would give them a strong basis to argue for what they need in order to do their jobs properly dasgupta said police should waive the issue of timing and show some compassion by arguing the cases on their facts instead they argue about time limits to prevent it would seem the important matter of whether they owe a legal duty to investigate from being determined they are causing further delay and distress to people already traumatised the taxi drivers victim said i just wish the police would have the common decency to see that ive been through enough it feels like theyre turning the knife at every opportunity still rubbing salt in now im at the stage where i cant let it go i cant walk away a spokesman for the met said the matter is ongoing

a man who has spent almost years in prison for a crime he always denied committing may soon be freed after dna traces from another man persuaded investigators to refer his case to the court of appeal victor nealon then a postman from redditch worcestershire was convicted of attempted rape in january and given a discretionary life sentence having already served time on remand he was not considered for parole because he consistently denied the offence now the criminal cases review commission has referred his case to the court of appeal endorsing the claims long made by nealons solicitors that the dna traces provide fresh evidence that make his conviction unsafe this was the third time nealons case had been before the ccrc twice before the ccrc had rejected speculative claims for dna testing nealons lawyer mark newby of jordans solicitors said the dna results from tests he independently commissioned were shocking not just because the samples came from a man who could not have been nealon but because it emerged that the victims clothing had never previously been examined yet the court was told at nealons trial that there was no dna evidence a spokesman for the ccrc said it considers that the new scientific evidence raises the real possibility that the court of appeal may quash the conviction he said the ccrc had verified the results of the dna examinations that newby had presented to them and organised an extensive series of tests to check whether the dna profile found on the victims clothing matched the profile of other people associated with the victim or the case the dna did not match either nealon or anyone known to the victim but was of an unidentified male with no match on the national database nealons defence team also queried inconsistencies in identification with an expert neurosurgeon attesting that he could not have been the man with the distinctive facial features reported by witnesses the attack took place on a young woman walking home from a nightclub in her assailant forced her to the floor and tried to remove her clothing a friend tried to get help before the woman eventually escaped both women said the attacker was an older man they had seen watching the victim at the club earlier that evening nealon has been serving his sentence in wakefield prison his lawyers hope his case will be fasttracked and that on appeal the

congratulations to the boy scouts of america for emphatically reaffirming their policy banning gays earlier this week despite historical evidence that this strategy for preventing child sexual abuse will earn them the same success rate as penn state football and the roman catholic church this is a point of fact not mere conjecture because the scouts are already despite their very best efforts at concealment on the record as having had similar difficulties as those other allegedly gayfree institutions with sexual abusers among the men it has entrusted with its youth and for similar reasons not because the molesters were gay in fact lgbt people make up a fraction of child abusers and the sexual preferences of the sick primarily male adults who molest children skew towards age rather than gender but because the organizations leaders refused to discipline the child abusers in its midst or to involve the police long past the time when they knew of instances of sexual abuse in fact the smoking gun in the most recent of the many cases filed against the scouts by former members for failing to protect them from predatory leaders was the scouts own perversion files these privately kept documents over pages of them detail accusations and investigations of sexual abuse and other improprieties by boy scout leaders across the united states from to as well as what the organization did and did not do to protect their youth once cases of abuse were known to them the files were never meant to see the light of day and the scouts fought hard and unsuccessfully to prevent them from being released after the trial which resulted in an m punitive judgment against the boy scouts of america the largest finding ever against the scouts in a sex case jury trial an impressive piece of investigative reporting by the oregonian during the trial documents numerous incidents where scout officials allowed known abuse to continue they ignored reports about william e tobiassen a longtime scout leader with sons of his own for more than two years the abuse was only exposed when the teenagers told a counselor and then police what had happened even then internal memos show the scouts executive overseeing tobiassen didnt want to ban him from scouting until there were formal charges oregon has no law mandating scouts to report their suspicions to authorities in contrast to teachers doctors and others and national headquarters was quick to advise the oregon scouts of their legal right to keep that information confidential not coincidentally secret files obtained by the oregonian during its investigation show no record of scout leaders alerting authorities to adults suspected of sexually abusing youth in at least other instances there are remarkable similarities between the boy scouts and the roman catholic churchs handling of the sexual abusers in their midst both institutions documented numerous instances of abuse failed either to discipline the adults involved or alert the authorities and then decided as the church did in at the height of its own sexual abuse scandal that gays were the problem which brings us closer to the heart of the matter ignore all of the scouts official mumbojumbo about the unidentified leaders who comprised the special committee of top scout leaders that made this decision especially the part about their alleged diversity of perspectives and opinions as the la times notes whats really happening here is a business decision about the organizations sustainability driven by the influence of two of the scouts most powerful benefactors the roman catholic and mormon churches about of the million members left in the dwindling organization belong to the church of jesus christ of latterday saints which encourages members to become involved in the boy scouts and has its own section on the boy scouts of america webpage counterbalancing the homophobia and financial clout of the roman catholic and mormon churches are the gayfriendly policies and financial clout of board members like ernst amp young and atampt both of which have expressed their reservations with the scouts ongoing antigay policies as in all politics

as a feminist activist who has been campaigning all of my adult life against sexual violence the idea of hundreds of impassioned folk marching the streets in protest about rape is my idea of heaven but the demonstrations that have been taking place in midlothian scotland trouble rather than please me robert greens was convicted of the vicious rape of a woman in and sentenced to years in prison the following year recently released greens was housed six miles from where the attack took place mainly because no other local authority would provide accommodation the protesters are angry that greens is so close to the area where he committed the crime and have graffitied and surrounded his home day and night shouting and waving placards a makeshift campsite and a portable toilet has been erected and the police are investigating allegations of criminal damage on the property in a show of classic nimbyism the protesters are demanding that greens be moved to another location a number of the campaigners are refusing to pay rent or council tax to midlothian council if greens is not moved we just cant stand by and have this monster live near to us one demonstrator told a reporter there are many young girls around here who are just too scared to go out on their own i and countless other women remember being told i should not go out on my own by the police and others during the hunt for the socalled yorkshire ripper in leeds in the late s as though there was only one nasty man with a desire to hurt women it was during this time i was attacked by two men i knew very well in the pub where i worked most rapes occur in the home or by men known to us unless the men are caught convicted and fit the stereotype of a real rapist many women are not even believed when we report rape one of the problems with the hysteria around greens is that it is based on the belief that real rape is committed by strangers carrying knives and that they are born rapists and will die rapists in viewing sex offenders as monsters as greens has been labelled by the protesters is to skew the reality of what rape is an ordinary commonplace act often perpetuated by nice respectable men in suits who live with us not just close by the large police presence that accompanied the crowd to greens home where marchers chanted behind metal barriers and the officers on permanent duty outside greens home would better serve the public by preventing further attacks on women demonstrations such as those against greens help perpetuate the myth that the only way to keep women and children safe is to publicise the addresses of all known sex offenders and send them off to live on a desert island but we would do better to find ways to improve the criminal justice systems response to rape so that men are deterred by the fear of actually going to prison if they commit such crimes the vast majority of rapes are never reported and often the victims tell no one there have been tragedies in the past as a result of dangerous offenders being bailed or released too early and sex offenders can of course go on to harm others but it is the responsibility of the courts and the wider criminal justice system to ensure our safety not vigilantes only of reported rapes end in a conviction on the charge of rape itself given the low reporting rates if a man commits a rape then he has on average a less than chance of being convicted of it those most likely to result in a conviction are classic stranger rapes involving a man with a knife that creeps about in the dark focusing our energies on crimes such as that committed by greens can lead us to believe the most dangerous myth of all that only nasty strangers pose a danger to women vigilantism is a poor form of justice those protesters marching through midlothian would do a better service if they started asking why most rapists never spend one day in prison this article was commissioned after a suggestion from maryellenwalton if theres a

conspiracy theorists are pretty much always treated as if they are insane the notion that powerful people might secretly conspire to conceal evidence or direct an outcome at the expense of the powerless is often portrayed by mainstream culture and media as entirely irrational indeed there are crazy conspiracy theories out there global warming is a hoax anyone but sometimes real conspiracies do take shape and those in power do collude to direct outcomes in secret nowhere is this more true than in the case of sexual abusers in elite institutions recently a slew of such elite institutions from yale university to the united states military which we explored in our discussion of the invisible war have been exposed as having become aware of systematic sexual abuse and having suppressed evidence of it on june of this year jerry sandusky an assistant football coach at penn state university was found guilty of abusing ten boys over the course of a decade and a half at first the sandusky case at penn state seemed like that of a lone abuser now it seems to be turning into a story of extensive and shockingly highlevel coverup of the known rape of children a new trove of emails from read by a firsthand source to a cnn reporter last week suggest that young lives were not just ruined because sandusky abused vulnerable boys for over years but were ruined too because powerful men around sandusky knew exactly what he was doing and colluded in detail with one another not to stop it in cnns report on disturbing emails from principals around the penn state abuse incidents which were read to the reporter by a source who had access to them a profoundly alarming pattern is clear the emails show a whistleblower doing the right thing in february graduate assistant mike mcqueary advised head coach joe paterno that he had seen what he believed to be sandusky sexually interacting with a boy in a shower in the locker room mcqueary testified in the sandusky trial that he saw sandusky sexually assaulting the child two administrators tim curley and gary schultz authority figures on campus the only ones who could have gone to authorities allegedly discussed a firsthand report of sandusky abusing a tenyearold child in a shower they nearly decided to alert the police or child protection officials then allegedly agreed not to do so schultz and curley now assert that mcqueary disclosed having witnessed merely inappropriate conduct horsing around schultz and curley both deny the allegations against them that they mishandled the original complaint and later lied to a grand jury investigation about it they have asked a judge to dismiss the charges the alleged scenario though is familiar institutional sympathy and leniency for a reported predator at the expense of the victim the email trail also implicates penn states former president graham spanier allegedly responding to the purported plan of schultz and curley to downgrade the incident and not report it to the department of welfare which investigates child sexual abuse cases spanier reportedly writes that this approach is acceptable and humane and reasonable but worries that the only downside for us is if the message to sandusky isnt heard and acted upon and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it these alleged exchanges reproduce precisely the classic reactions to revelations of sexual abuse in groups ranging from families to churches to colleges no one says we have a firsthand witness of the molestation of a child and its plausible because the police already investigated this guy for a similar reported incident he has constant unsupervised access to children we need to report this guy at once and alert everyone responsible for their wellbeing instead there is a collusive and immediate distancing of responsibility there is again classically also a collusive minimization of harm to the child the abstraction of the child to an insignificant cipher the subject and finally there is the joint agreement to extend the peculiar empathy patriarchy always seems to find at the prospect of a respected white man facing any public shame or discomfort better to sacrifice the victims welfare and hide the affair from the scrutiny of justice than endure the intolerable prospect of a highstatus and trusted white mans secret sexual vices being exposed what is especially heartbreaking about the victims in this case is that these children who were enrolled in sanduskys second mile charity were already vulnerable they had no parents to confide in or to defend them no adults around who would have been safe to speak to that is the nature of a successful conspiracy a watertight degree plot with no escape for its ensnared victims that would have been these kids reality one victim described at the sandusky trial how when sandusky would abuse him in a basement he knew mrs sandusky was on the floor above watching tv but knew there was no point in going to her that child would have picked up as kids and victims in general do in a collusive coverup situation that there would be no point in going to the penn state authorities or other responsible adults victims sense when everyone is in on protecting an abuser they suffer three times over first the abuse itself then the betrayal of trust and finally the denial of the reality of their experience it is that knowing act of suppression that makes such conspiracies criminal,2012-07,conspiracy theorist pretty much always treated insane notion powerful people might secretly conspire conceal evidence

the home office is to launch a pioneering scheme on thursday to alert sex workers about people with a history of violence including rape the scheme which is being launched in manchester will encourage sex workers to coordinate with police on a national scale it also has the wider intent of taking murderers rapists and other violent criminals off the streets it will enable intelligence about people with a history of violence to be fed into a national intelligence database sex workers will be alerted by text email or phone app about people who have carried out attacks online escort agencies street sex workers and those working in brothels will all be able to access the warnings the national ugly mugs pilot scheme is based on an australian system in which sex workers alerted each other to violent customers similar schemes have been operating informally in areas of the uk but this is the first time that information will be collated nationally some violent offenders move from one area to another to commit offences and it is hoped that the improved intelligence sharing will prevent serial attackers from committing repeated offences the association of chief police officers is backing the scheme if sex workers do not want to report crimes directly to the police they can go through local sex work projects which can pass intelligence to the police anonymously the scheme will be managed by the uk network of sex work projects an umbrella organisation of campaigners and academics one manchesterbased street sex worker naomi welcomed the initiative i have been working on the streets for years she said i have experienced lots of attacks rapes and attempted kidnap its good to know that someone cares about what happens to us and that sex workers will be better protected alex bryce coordinator of the pilot scheme said this is a groundbreaking initiative and will build on all the fantastic work of local schemes in improving the safety of sex workers i believe that this scheme can and will save lives lynne featherstone the minister for equalities and criminal information said this scheme encourages sex workers to report violent incidents so that others can be safeguarded in the future and more perpetrators can be dealt with merseyside police have pioneered projects working with sex workers to share intelligence about violent attacks and have an above average rate of convictions for rapes carried out against sex workers and others detective superintendent tim keelan from the forces public protection unit said what is unique in merseyside is that we have a rape investigation team where dedicated detectives work with specially trained officers who link in with rape victims within an hour of an offence being reported the metropolitan police said there were arrests for prostitutionrelated offences in the london area but this number fell to arrests in it has a special team focusing on vicerelated crime in the five olympic host

women offenders in oldham are being offered intensive help by a series of agencies to help prevent them reoffending at a womens group session last week i spoke to some of those involved in the project coordinated by greater manchester probation trust they meet in a neutral location for the twohour sessions that involve probation officers health workers and other agencies such as education promoting healthy eating and positive choices there are similar groups across the country helping female offenders stacey who has received a twoyear suspended sentence admits she didnt speak much when she first attended the meetings id just be looking at my phone i wouldnt speak she says ive got a phobia of fruit she says one of my goals has been to have a small piece of fruit and a bit of water and ive managed to do it and i feel a lot more positive about the future tracy who is says five years ago she met a serial rapist and was prosecuted for assisting him by giving him a lift when he was on the run as he had committed a further offence while he was being sought by police she handed herself into the police once she realised what hed done and she was prosecuted i got a suspended sentence and i was on probation she says i was in a financial mess and then i committed benefit fraud for which i was prosecuted prior to meeting this guy who messed everything up for me id been in a steady relationship from a young age and we have a son tracy believes she was groomed by the rapist whom she fell in love with and was controlled by im very angry she says people say move on but how can i move on i feel like the justice system has let me down he should have not been let out in the first place its just unfortunate i was in the wrong place at the wrong time her life she admits has been turned upside down and she is living with the consequences of what happened her son lives with his father her former partner because she was an emotional wreck after what happened with the rapist it was she adds a crucifying decision but i thought hed be better off and have more stability i had to put him first ive lost my job my respect and my son basically ive lost everything these things always happen to somebody else dont they and now it is me i would like to do volunteering work but there are barriers that prevent me doing this because of what i have done im struggling with my lack of employment prospects i know it was my choice to commit benefit fraud but at the time i was not rational and i was emotionally unstable she says shed never been in a court in her life and suddenly i was in styal prison on remand and segregated initially i felt vulnerable because of the media coverage of the case as i was being transported from court to styal it was on the radio when i was in the back of the prison van ive not slept for five years she adds i dont sleep not surprisingly she finds it difficult to trust people particularly men despite her problems shes made steady progress since coming to the sessions which have helped her confidence and social skills there are bits of being in styal that ive literally blacked out because i was completely traumatised she added becky an exoffender who was sentenced in says at the time of her prison sentence she was in a bad way she pleaded guilty to arson and a charge of recklessly endangering life her partner at the time threatened to kill her and her young baby and held her five other children hostage for six hours she was prosecuted after a fire at the house and lost custody of her children after discovering his affairs when i found three pairs of girls school socks in a drawer i smashed the house up top to bottom then the fire broke out she received a threeyear prison sentence as shed admitted her involvement becky says she is not proud of being in prison but says she was in such a bad way she felt she couldnt breathe without her partner for the first four days she asked to be sectioned but soon released that she wasnt mentally ill and could cope becky has been attending the group since january when she was released from prison on licence she was a qualified support worker and wants to work as an alcohol and drug counsellor the people in this group are so nice she says its a trust thing you dont feel judged and isolated here catherine senior a probation officer with greater manchester probation trust says the women often have issues with domestic violence but because the group is laidback and the women support each other it is a better environment for them they are motivated to come here and that different approach seems to work the various agencies encourage women to register with doctors and dentists and join a gym if they want to they are offered cooking and food tasting sessions and work is done to help address mental health issues with counselling offered and help for those who may have problems with alcohol and drugs probation officer georgina threlfall of greater manchester probation trust says some of the women are only compelled to attend probation once a month but they go to the weekly sessions of their own volition that clearly demonstrates that the group is helping them turn their lives around so that they can once again play a valuable role in their community she says the anecdotal evidence is that the sessions are making a difference,2012-07,woman offender

in a yearold man was convicted for making lewd comments to two women on the london underground groping their breasts and running away why should anybody be subjugated and made to feel so vulnerable while going about their daily business sadly their experience though extreme is not an isolated one many women have experienced unwanted sexual attention and sexual harassment such as aggressive staring touching rubbing groping lewd comments and flashing on public transport a recent survey carried out for the end violence against women campaign found that of women aged have experienced unwanted sexual attention while on public transport of women aged have experienced unwanted sexual attention and of all women aged and over have experienced unwanted sexual attention these statistics do not and cannot convey the impact on the women that are harassed in this manner through my work i have encountered many women who have been the victim of unwanted sexual attention or sexual harassment one was katie who was travelling by bus when she was harassed a man approached her and persistently pressed himself against her while she was seated she moved down the bus to get away from him the man then harassed another woman who also moved away at which point he walked back over to where katie was standing and proceeded to press himself against her again katie shouted expecting help no one helped including the driver she left the bus at the next stop katie said she felt objectified and completely indignant this happened in broad daylight and even worse he got away with it she told me that it was bad enough that this had happened but that no one stepped in to help made her feel completely powerless katie did not report her harassment which is common in many episodes of sexual harassment and unwanted sexual attention it is clear that many of londons women have developed coping mechanisms from initially laughing it off to changing behaviour for example by cutting journeys short or avoiding certain carriages when alone or late at night from the women ive spoken to theres a belief that this is just what you have to put up with and while not normal its at least not surprising and the best way to deal with it is to endure and ignore it but having to change your behaviour and daily routine through fear is unacceptable this problem needs to be tackled on a number of levels for a start all incidents need to be reported to the police and the perpetrators prosecuted we all need to say enough this kind of behaviour has no place anywhere at any time the vast majority of men share our disgust however there is still a minority who think this behaviour is acceptable extreme cases may indicate someone with complex issues however the lowerlevel behaviour is equally unacceptable like katie many women probably dont even consider it to be harassment or unwanted sexual attention lambeth council in london recently launched a know the difference campaign which has shown real results they discovered a high incidence of unwanted sexual attention and sexual harassment in parts of their borough working with the local police traders and licensees they developed a range of publicity materials such as leaflets and posters put up across the borough and at transport hubs these bluntly told men to know the difference between flirting and crossing the line to unwanted sexual attention and sexual harassment this campaign with posters in key locations in the borough and on licensed premises has been followed by a drop in in sexual offences in the borough however not all public bodies are as forward thinking as lambeth council for the past three years i have tried to get transport for london to adopt this approach so far with no success lambeths initiative will not stop all incidents but it is an important step that should be adopted across the london transport network why should women be subjugated and made to feel so vulnerable while going

how does one go about defining a powerful woman forbes has an annual bash at it with its worlds most powerful women list the latest of which is published today the results are often a mixed bag hinting at mysterious assessment criteria the queen for example is a mainstay despite wielding little constitutional or legislative power while anna wintour the one woman who is personally responsible for deciding which clothes we all put on in the morning arguably has a much wider scope of influence but no title angela merkel meanwhile makes important economic decisions and we give little thought to her outfit choices unlike lady gaga whose influence has so permeated popular culture that she has her own social network and has beaten aung san suu kyi louise mensch meanwhile also has her own social network but does not appear anywhere on the list although by next year she may have broken america and despite having forgone political power might be well on her way to setting up a new world order im already building a bunker in the garden what all this listing and categorising seems to imply is that there is no one way of defining power one neednt even be alive if were defining it in terms of influence the virgin mary would be a strong contender forbes sticks to the here and now some women on the list are opinion formers jill abramson arianna huffington while others hold political office hillary clinton or are married to those that do michelle obama many on the list have fought their way to the top of maledominated arenas such as finance further complicating matters because most people have no idea who they are so while some women seem to be on the list due to the premise that public profile and visibility constitute power others are unseen puppeteers pulling the strings behind the scenes all this talk of power is fittingly capitalistic of course you could say that the power many of these women yield lies in their ability to get you and me to buy stuff often by blending seamlessly into power structures created by men much to the chagrin of second wave feminists what were the shoulder pads and masculine tailoring of the s if not sartorial attempts to man up germaine greer is oft quoted at least by me as having said i wanted to liberate women from the vacuum cleaner not get them on the board of hoover the feminists of the s wanted a revolution but instead they got facebook and oprah and yet telling women that they wield the wrong kind of power not only rudely undermines all the hard work theyve undergone in order to claw their way to the top but also raises yet more complicated questions such as what exactly do you want from us goddammit i once asked someone who worked in the city why there werent more women on the boards of fortune companies his answer put simply was that in order to wield power one must be something of an arsehole there are fewer women arseholes he continued than there are male hence the power imbalance this theory will inevitably anger many people below the line and though i am not condoning it it may go some way to explaining why successful women are characterised as ruthless powerhungry and ambitious to a fault perhaps like their male counterparts they are perhaps they have to be it would be unfair to speculate too much in this regard as not one of them has ever asked me out for a drink and is unlikely to they might be perfectly lovely human beings another fluffy definition of power could be that it belongs to those who precipitate genuine and hopefully positive social change this is problematic considering that many on the list steadfastly maintain the status quo those who wish to overhaul the system are unlikely to be granted accolades by the system however influential they may be the common factor these women share is not a desire for change but somewhat fittingly for forbes money money the ability to earn it control it sometimes philanthropically often not manipulate it and influence how others spend it quite simple really you or i might have very different definitions of power we could see it as the ability to stand up to dissenters and deliver our viewpoints with clarity bravery and authority as having a voice in the face of lifethreatening terror those who hold this kind of power are often lacking it in the more traditional political sense aung san suu kyi an exception has achieved both its what zen buddhists might call inner strength and it is something you can hold without having status or large earnings or even influence it does not corrupt but neither does it turn a profit hence the absence of a list perhaps we need to make one,2012-08,doe one go defining powerful woman forbes ha annual bash world powerful woman list latest published today result

the gentlemen of the augusta national golf club have finally welcomed two eminent ladies into their membership condoleezza rice and darla moore as a former british womens open champion i have some gentle words of advice about welcoming women golfers into their midst men and women enjoy an entirely different game firstly no man must ever comment that women are playing from furtherforward tees they must never utter the forbidden words of course you have quite a start on this hole this is like a red rag to a bull the danger is that the woman takes offence and drives from the same tee as her man that tends to turn him into a quivering wreck he is likely to fluff his shot the woman outdrives him from the same tee whoops the men at augusta must ensure that there are proper ladies tees on the course and it is imperative that ladies tees are aimed correctly nearly all men aim straight very few women do it is essential that the ladies tees are in great positions never stuck out on a limb as if an afterthought even if women themselves are an afterthought at augusta and as for slow play this is the curse of golf women like to think they play more quickly than men men assume that women are slow the game between a man and a woman can be like the hare and the tortoise women do not like looking for lost golf balls as all women golfers know men look too far they overestimate their own strength she will often delight in exclaiming i dont think you went that far and the odds are she is right the men of augusta need to learn ball spotting skills and if the man goes to the woods to relieve himself he should announce his temporary departure lest his lady partner follows him with the assumption that he has lost yet another golf ball the men of augusta need to learn just when to praise the lady partners golf shot the praise must be absolutely correct it is almost worse to shout good shot for a shot that isnt quite perfect lest it sounds patronising than to forget to shout praise for something special getting it wrong can cause friction she may punish him by stopping talking to him he may see this as a reward when driving a golf buggy the man should always invite the lady partner to drive he should never ever try to give her advice about the club to play and certainly never say now i would take a iron so i should think it is a iron for you the next thing you know that dear sweet lady golfer will wrap his iron or her iron round his knees or somehow drive over his iron and bend it beyond use the gentlemen of augusta must think very carefully about any areas of the clubhouse where women are not welcome other than the mens locker room of course it is patronising to call the ladies locker room the powder room an often used alternative for clubs where there are no lockers because there are no lady members it must be called the locker room and should be attractive with the thickest carpet possible and wonderful pictures of the handsomest male golfers in the world seve ballesteros and ernie els and the mirrors and lighting must always be chosen to flatter but the women must never be asked for opinions about girlie things like the colour of curtains and soft furnishings it is better to leave that to the wife of a man member and to consult the women about diesel engines and beer things they might surprisingly enjoy and lastly of course the men must understand that women can be ruthless opponents on the golf course it is no good pleading a bad back or lack of practice or making any other excuse a woman will never have any sympathy for an opponent even if the opponent is very old very young or slightly tearful even if that slightly tearful opponent is a man,2012-08,gentleman augusta national golf club finally welcomed two eminent lady

as the great granddaughter of emmeline pankhurst and granddaughter of sylvia pankhurst it is no surprise that a passion for womens rights runs in my veins a few weeks ago i stood alongside my daughter laura pankhurst and the women dressed as suffragettes at danny boyles beautifully choreographed olympics opening ceremony the reenactment was one way of paying homage to the sacrifices of countless women in the fight for their right to vote yet the suffragette campaign was just one aspect of the wider struggle for equality it continues to this day which is why many of the women who acted as feminist agitators at the opening ceremony will be campaigning on october joining uk feministas lobby of parliament the event will give women and men from across the uk the opportunity to speak truth to power by lobbying their mps en masse parliament will be treated to a chorus of voices calling for an end to the attacks on womens rights and greater commitment to equality the pace of progress was pretty slow even before the recession started to bite eightyfour years on from all women gaining the vote we are still outnumbered four to one in parliament and years after winning the legal right to equal pay women still face a fulltime pay gap of while of women of ethnic minorities live in poverty in addition up to three million women and girls in the uk experience rape domestic violence stalking or other violence each year women are being hit disproportionately by austerity of the funding to violence against women services from local authorities was cut between and and last year on a typical day women seeking refuge were turned away by womens aid due to lack of space over the past couple of years womens right to seek a safe legal abortion has also been undermined the result of all this is a shredding of womens economic independence and erosion of the fundamental right to live free from violence but there is cause for hope a recent resurgence in feminist activism has bought these issues back on to the streets and into the headlines its time this commitment was mirrored in parliament thats why a broad coalition of womens organisations have joined forces to stage a feminist lobby of parliament there are urgent changes that need to take place in this parliamentary term these include reversing the cuts to childcare supporting and ringfencing sure start centres ensuring schools tackle violence against women and girls through the curriculum and in school policies modernising abortion regulations and extending them to northern ireland underlying these specific demands the lobby will urge mps to draw on the decades of research by womens organisations on the policies and practices that will help us build an equal future for women and men the problem is not a lack of proposed solutions it is a lack of political will thats why my daughter laura and i will be reunited with the olympic suffragettes on october joining uk feminista to lobby for an end to the backsliding on womens rights a future the suffragettes would have been proud of is possible its time parliament stepped up to help build it,2012-08,great granddaughter emmeline pankhurst granddaughter

a female member of police staff who was sexually assaulted in a bar by a detective has said she will never go out with another group of police officers again because she does not trust them the woman spoke out as mike johnson of the humberside police force was sentenced to a month community order and curfew after admitting sexually assaulting her last year sentencing johnson at bradford crown court on thursday judge john potter said that what he had done had been nothing less than sexual abuse johnson is the third member of the humberside force to be investigated for sexual offences in the last months his sentence comes as the independent police complaints commission carries out an inquiry into the forces investigations of such allegations following a complaint by a woman in one of the three humberside cases about the way her claim had been handled johnsons case was one of documented by the guardian in an investigation last month into the scale of abuse of power by police officers and police community support officers who target women and vulnerable individuals to sexual harass or assault them the investigation revealed concerns that the problem could be more widespread than previously believed next month the ipcc and the association of chief police officers is publishing a report examining the issue bradford crown court heard on thursday that johnson assaulted the woman during a night out with colleagues in a bar near hull city centre in may last year johnson twice put his arm around the small of the womans back in the space of minutes in an inappropriate manner the court heard on the second occasion her ran his fingers down over the back of her clothing and touched her in the vaginal area the court heard at the time she had a number of personal difficulties was engaging in counselling and therapy and making good progress which she said was knocked back by this conduct in a victim impact statement she told the court i strongly feel he needs some kind of treatment he needs help so this kind of thing doesnt happen to another woman in the past six years i have only been out very occasionally and have always felt safe this isnt the case now the way i feel about things now i will never go out with a group of police officers again i will never feel safe potter said the woman had been very brave in coming forward and had acted with courage in extremely difficult circumstances johnson a police officer for more than seven years pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault last month on the day he was due to stand trial the crown prosecution service decided not to proceed with two further counts of sexual assault against another woman also a female member of police staff on a separate date he resigned from the force last year nicholas barker prosecuting told the court that when johnson was arrested and interviewed he replied that he had no recollection of the incident last may near hull city centre christopher dunn defending said the offence johnson admitted happened after he had been drinking to excess on an empty stomach in a very highly emotionally charged gathering dunn told the hearing a moment of madness had stripped him of the work he loved decimated his career prospects and affected his family johnson from bridlington east yorkshire who worked for humberside cids priority crime team had previously served for five years as a soldier in the royal anglian regiment he was ordered to sign the sex offenders register for five years in june gary hastings a former humberside police community support officer was jailed for years for child sex offences he resigned from the humberside force after being suspended during the investigation it emerged last week that a second pcso has also been investigated by the forces department of professional standards after a woman complained of an assault when he visited her while on duty on january the officer was never charged with a criminal offence and resigned from the force in february avoiding any disciplinary action the woman complained about how the case was investigated to the ipcc and the watchdog announced it was starting an independent investigation into how humberside dealt with her allegations detective superintendent ray higgins head of professional standards for humberside police defended the way the force had handled the inquiries into all three officers he said humberside police does not take any sort of criminal activity of our staff lightly and we strive to ensure that any inappropriate behaviour by police officers and staff be it criminal

the horror and revulsion of watching the abuse meted out to patients at the private hospital winterbourne view was a far more visceral experience for me than for panorama viewers last year who dont have a family member with a learning disability the pain was far deeper because i felt like i was watching my daughters future being played in front of me emily is now and her inner torment of the hormonal battle of adolescence which screams out for her to detach is coupled with her neurology of autism and learning disability that limits that detachment so she suffers her torment as best she can and attempts selfrestraint because shes a person of decency and inherent kindness shes just a teenager how much easier for her if she could tell me to fuck off but she cant for the last three years we have found ourselves increasingly under attack physically and mentally we are broken whereas a neurotypical teenager might shout abuse and stamp off to be with their understanding equally parenthating friends emily has no outlet other than her fists added to that in the last months she has refused school and respite she spends all day in her nightie and her anxieties are managed by controlling her environment completely its what you do when youre frightened gone are the days when i could pick her up as a protesting toddler and take her where she does not wish to go last year i sustained a broken coccyx and last month a broken finger so now we face the thing we fear the most the thing that has kept me awake for two weeks and gave me nightmares and other sleepless nights in the years since diagnosis were sending emily to a residential school as mencap and the challenging behaviour foundation issued their report today i read it and i knew that the them in the report was us as lovely as the residential school is its still deemed to be an institution by their descriptions i support the report and its call for action to close large institutions and develop appropriate local services but this is the only choice families such as ours have we have few extended family members no social network no resources no more strength and no hope left sooner or later i will be seriously injured emily will have enough awareness to know that she was the cause and will have to live with that long after her teenage anger leaves her her memory is phenomenal politicians so quick to arrive for their photo opportunities with children such as mine are equally quick to turn away from the same families when we need them most it is as ever a matter of cost over value i know that hate crime against disabled people is a fact of life from verbal abuse on the streets to murder of vulnerable people its happening more and more on twitter this morning a comment was made about the cost to the taxpayer of care for children like mine what about the value of decent provision in the quality of life it offers when did that become an inconvenient truth with families separated by hundreds of miles of course abuse flourishes by those with cruel intentions the detailed reporting of institutionalised abuse may torment people like me but the solution can only be found when learning disabled people are valued as equal members of society not pity figures nor punchbags but human beings with hopes and dreams and the right to be listened to and heard when we allow bullies in the media in comedy in education in tabloid papers and in the heart of government to make disabled people the untouchable others undeserving of a seat at our dinner tables let alone in our policy framed to support them we enable the bigots with every apathetic turn of the head we permit the scum behind closed doors to advance on human vulnerability and make them into a torture toy for their own amusement cruelty isnt preventable but becoming a society that refuses to tolerate the spectrum of discrimination from hate speech to hate crime is entirely achievable it just takes effort encompassing disability in current hate speech laws as a crime in and of itself would be a start im spending the days while we wait to see if our local council will permit our choice of residential school trying not to think of winterbourne view my nights are spent thinking of nothing else the school is local expensive and expert and the students thrive its everything we could hope for our girl it comes highly recommended intellectually its a straightforward decision but the heartbreak of letting go feels like giving up and the fear which stalks my mind is unrelenting,2012-08,horror

in womens own reported an astonishing feat job experts said that no woman could do boring screwing a breech ring for the barrel of a sixpounder tank gun in a giant lathe but miss megan lewis has been doing it at the ordnance factory where of machine operatives are women she said i learned by watching the setter at the machine officials were astounded during the second world war most women were at work against the wishes of the trade unions traditionally unions argued that men needed to earn a family wage sufficient to keep a wife and children and this should not be undercut by women claiming male skilled jobs and equal pay a womans place was in the home employment was and still often is segregated men then were employed in heavy industry women in the lowpaid business of care secretarial and admin work and the service sector trade unions are an important component in a democratic society but for decades they did not serve women well strikes and negotiations were a beerandsandwiches job almost exclusively conducted by and for the brothers meetings were at night when most women were at home engaged in ironing shirts and childcare im all right jack was the slogan while with honourable exceptions the men paid scant attention to the needs of jill often the sole breadwinner in the family the image of the average trade unionist was a white workingclass and bluecollar bloke male pale and stale today the average british trade unionist is a young degreeeducated white woman working in the professions women outnumber men in their prime in the s unions had more than million members now they have million only of the working population is unionised less than in the private sector women have become vital to the survival of unions in a yet more extraordinary change this autumn the trades union congress tuc the umbrella body for affiliated unions will welcome frances ogrady its first female general secretary in years we like to take our time she says former tuc leader lord monks says she has diplomacy charm and imagination another senior union official says she wont just make history because she is female she knows the trade union movement has to modernise it has to attract people interested in the creation of a different kind of economy this is a difficult time for trade unions but its also an opportunity and it helps that its a woman whos got that opportunity ogrady one of five children was educated at an oxford comprehensive her dad worked at the cowley car factory she raised her two children alone and knows what it means to be a carer she has also been a champion of parttime workers and the lowpaid and argued the need for a minimum wage in the s unlike many of her male colleagues she has risen through the ranks without the benefit of a stayathome wife kevin maguire of the daily mirror says she could yet prove david camerons nemesis ogrady has been in the forefront of bringing on a small army of younger women via the organising academy she set up in it runs a month crash course for union officials and a support network becky wright was a graduate and is now the academys director she says when i was i was asked if id thought about joining a union i wasnt entirely sure what that meant they said do you want to learn how to be a campaigner and i thought yes i do at the academy wright worked with the transport salaried staffs association tssa to unionise people in travel agencies it didnt go all that well she says smiling what we realised is that if a union only has money to hire five people including me is it feasible to try to organise people in now defunct travel agent lunn poly tssa is in a maledominated industry wright was then did she encounter sexism not so much sexism as geekiness if you work in a rail union you become incredibly geeky about trains even i knew the differences between a or train ageism she says has been more of a battle a point other young women also make the response was often you are to years younger than me what can you tell me but after five minutes or so wed get on with the business in hand since then ive worked in a lot of places where women are in the majority its taken for granted thats just the way it is a strong union usually means that the pay gap is narrower and conditions are better more than that theres also openness and transparency for women in particular thats important without it thats when discrimination takes place for female officials a trade union career unlike years ago can offer variety security and good terms and conditions and not just in personnel scarlet harris tuc womens officer worked in the maledominated rmt union led by the bullish bob crow five years ago when i first started i was the only woman in the industrial relations department bob crow was really supportive i was also well looked after when i was pregnant she says natalie jacottet read philosophy at university and eight years ago joined the communication workers union cwu she has been head of research since i was lucky as these jobs dont come up very often my motivation was to work somewhere where i care about what we do at unison the countrys largest public sector union of its million members are female many low paid poor pay discrimination in pregnancy and bullying in the workplace are among the issues that many unions still seem listless about will that improve when the current generation of female thirtysomethings acquire power as well as responsibility sian rabilaleh from swansea is unisons national officer for health part of whose job is to campaign against the threat of privatisation in the nhs a graduate she joined unison six years ago unison felt like home she says in campaigning bargaining negotiating the trade union movement is changing we also have a massive learning and education agenda that attracts women a person might have left school early but through the union they have the opportunity to get a degree one person said i was told i wouldnt be worth anything and now i know differently that means something we try and encourage members to understand that as part of a collective they can make a change in the s and s collective action was everywhere now it only seems to happen on the first day of the sales certainly the huge increase in female trade union membership in the public sector isnt down to an outbreak of activism says brian strutton of the gmb the general workers union in years the gmb has recruited teaching assistants changes to membership often reflect whats happening in the economy rather than changes to society or union policy strutton says the gmb is now nearly malefemale membership yet the number of women as branch officers workplace reps and national officers is nowhere near a reflection of that proportion and thats despite huge efforts to increase participation weve still got a hell of a long way to go what will encourage a woman to sign up perhaps twitter facebook and new social media can help stoked by anger at government cuts tough times are back we have the highest female unemployment rate for years workers rights are being eroded services being slashed alice hood is senior policy officer for public services at the tuc she is helping to organise a tuc mass demonstration in london on october under the banner a future that works she says unions have to be more imaginative about how they recruit we should ask a woman how she wants to get involved and support her to do that at any level of commitment not expect her to fit into a fixed structure she says nigerianborn helen parkerjayne isibor says she is trying to recruit by example she is a professional singer songwriter and composer whose album the venus bushfires is out in october she is also a member of two committees for the musicians union when i was asked to stand i said whos going to vote for me and i was told other people like you so i hope other women will say if she can do it so can i helens hair is a statement all on its own there is ft of it draped on a bamboo cane she describes it as partgeisha part bonsai tree i like to feel very rooted she always works to musicians union agreements collective bargaining matters because it sets a standard i am creative but i also need to earn a living ive got a voice i have a responsibility to use it so what has really changed for women in the trade union movement is sexism racism and discrimination dying out or simply better camouflaged are tomorrows potential union heads developing a different kind of leadership from the men or are some just as bullying as the macho union stereotype and how do female veterans of the earlier battles gauge progress in the then yearold brenda dean now baroness dean of thorntonlefylde went to work as a secretary in a printing firm at she successfully stood for election as an assistant secretary of the manchester branch of the maledominated society of graphical and allied trades sogat i won elections because we only put initials on the election papers i was bd otherwise id never have won a reporter from the manchester evening news said that must mean women now had equality i was single i said when a mum with two kids at home can do this job thats when well begin to motor dean adds when i was handling my first redundancies the male officials said the parttime women should go first because they were only working for pin money i said i couldnt do that i was there to represent the whole union in she became the first woman president of sogat and in its general secretary almost immediately taking on rupert murdoch and the yearlong wapping strike a battle the union eventually lost during wapping even men on my own side were saying shes bound to have a breakdown so in one press conference i said ive got something personal to say do i look like im going to break down in tears unions have been through a very tough period dean says its time for rebirth and renewal women are vital to that but were in a very fragile place at present only of the unions affiliated to the tuc are led by a woman gail cartmail failed her plus and at began work as a hairdressers apprentice before joining a publishing company i discovered that the young man next to me doing exactly the same job was earning more my dad said join a union so i did she joined the national graphical association sexism and racism were rife she says if you complained about sexual harassment the response was whod want to harass you we said that union meetings should be at a time and a place convenient for women not just for blokes who drank beer we fought to put other issues on the agenda and for time during the working day for cervical cancer screening then we could say and what about screening for testicular cancer too a win for women is a win for every worker in the s fed up with the allmale panels and conference speakers cartmail was a founder member of swomp socialist women on male platforms providing a long list of female speakers and occasionally issuing statements from swomp high command swomp was followed by affiliate owine one woman is not enough in a blog in she pointed out that only of the speakers at the tuc conference that year had been female cartmail is now an assistant general secretary at unite two years ago she unsuccessfully stood for election for the top post i was never going to win but i thought it unconscionable that there should be only male candidates she pointed out that union heads need to do more than willywaving the progress we made is getting lost research indicates that while black and ethnic minority women are more likely than any other group to join a union they are even more severely underrepresented at leadership level sharon holder the gmb national officer for schools is the most senior female union official working in the public services black people join unions because who else is there to defend us she says her parents were originally from grenada she represents gmb members she left school in west london at and eventually became a carer for older people at she joined the union in the s she became a housing caretaker i was isolated harassed and intimidated by both management and my work colleagues she says if id complained to the management they would have said this isnt the environment for a woman holder says sexism and racism havent changed dramatically theyve just become less overt at the back of my mind in negotiations sometimes i think have these talks been difficult because im black or perhaps its dealing with a strong woman that some men find difficult if all you see at the top is men that means when you come across a woman further down the chain you dont have to show her respect because in your mind shes not going anywhere if i get that kind of reaction i give them a glare which means back off but thats a very male way to behave and why should i have to do that professor geraldine healy of the university of london has conducted a twoyear study of white and black women union leaders in the us and britain coauthored with professor gill kirton women and union leadership is published in the autumn in it many women talk of walking a tightrope to survive in a boys club one young white british trade unionist says although there are a lot of women where i work its very macho and can be very aggressive in all aspects the queen bee still exists keeping other females out because theres only room for one token woman according to healy and kirtons research alliances between women can be punished senior men blocked one woman for promotion because she publicly supported another womans appointment professor healy says that nevertheless women union leaders have a strong sense of accountability antiracism and social justice count many articulate the need for women to work collaboratively build consensus from the bottom up and help others one used the phrase made popular by the black american activist angela davis in saying the aim for a woman trade union leader should be to lift as you rise a number of the younger women i talked to said a union had given them a second chance in life joanne thomas of leeds is one of the most senior women at shopworkers union usdaw the fourthlargest union in britain with members she had a child at and took a parttime job in a warehouse she became a shop steward at people didnt take to us very well at first i was a bit cocky i had to earn my place with the management and the members she adds the unions given me knowledge confidence skills ive been on a lot of courses i was earning a year when my daughter was young now i have a career at she was promoted to area organiser i was responsible for members and shop stewards usdaw took a real chance appointing me and i respect that are we still working in mans world sometimes very rarely do i negotiate with women of course at times when ive walked into a room with a male colleague its assumed hes my boss but i know i have the knowledge and experience so its up to me to be the best i can be im responsible for people when we get good results for our members in this tough economic climate theres no feeling like it its a paradox that the current economic climate pushing many women unwillingly back into the home might also provide the spark to revitalise unions in the public sector at least the future of the unions is definitely female but in years time will the sisters rising up have been neutered or will their fire still be burning bright frances ogrady says she was heartened when she visited the picket lines during the oneday public sector strike on november last year the biggest strike in a generation it was overwhelmingly young women who had never been on strike before never been on a

since my channel investigation into sex gangs in the uk was aired a year ago ive not once failed to be left distraught by the photos splashed month after month on our front pages there seems to be a neverending number of men convicted of a crime so grotesque that the worst details are often kept out of the press i stare at the faces of these criminals searching for a hint of evil that will give them away yet i am only ever struck by just how ordinary they look they are blokes youd pass in the street someones father brother or son but these men from towns and cities such as rochdale and derby are far from ordinary they are guilty of committing some of the vilest and most terrifying sexual crimes against children last year along with a c dispatches team i started investigating some of these sex gangs and how they preyed on young girls just hitting puberty they used a deadly combination of charm coercion and violence to groom them for sexual abuse rape and gangrape what i learnt during those months has often kept me awake at night this crime has today become heavily politicised due to its racial dimension the systemic failures of the authorities and the manner in which it has unravelled over the last couple of years but to understand the complexities around it its important to understand the dark heart of the crime it starts with a pernicious and sophisticated grooming process girls between the ages of and are often targeted by boys their own age they are befriended in the most innocuous of places schools shopping malls libraries during this first stage the girls receive gifts alcohol cigarettes and are taken to fun places driven around in cars not long after these young impressionable girls are introduced to an evergrowing group of older men soon they become completely out of their depth as they are sucked into a whirl that is as exciting as it is overwhelming a girl as young as or might be defenceless against such a potent social vortex its at this point that the friendly warm atmosphere theyve been engulfed in turns murky and dark many victims of this crime report being suddenly and unexpectedly attacked and raped in a public toilet a yard an alleyway even a childrens playground the testimonies of many of the victims then detail that daily and weekly life involves being raped and gangraped multiple times for several months one police officer described some of the assaults to me in great detail the level of sexual violence involved made me feel physically sick anal rape horrific internal injuries and sexual humiliation i cannot describe in a newspaper who knows i wondered as i stared at victims photos on a police wall if these girls will ever recover one young woman i met spoke eloquently about her years of abuse she told me with wellrehearsed conviction that she has put it behind her only her glassy eyes gave her away the question ive been asked more often than any other is why the girls return to their attackers knowingly to face further assault the question can be offensive if it carries with it an accusation of complicity i explain that these girls have been through such a destructive form of grooming and assault that theyve lost all free will the crime is so exploitative and manipulative that the girls have no control over their own behaviour victims victim support groups and the parents of victims i interviewed all talked about the omnipotent power the perpetrators wield over the girls the men use drugs and alcohol to gain compliance fear the threat of rape and violence and the terrible shame the girls feel coerces them into returning and so the vicious cycle of abuse continues some of the experts i interviewed described it as being similar to domestic violence with times the power because the crime was so vicious and the girls so young trauma manipulation and extreme fear are powerful tools to use against anyone let alone a young teenage girl yet some of these victims have been courageous enough to come forward and over the past year there has been court case after court case with many successful convictions what dispatches lifted the lid on no longer surprises it should come least of all as a surprise to the police social workers and child protection teams who have known about these crimes for more than a decade the spotlight appears to have now moved from the criminals to a system that failed to protect young vulnerable teenage girls police officers i have spoken to a local politician i interviewed all told me the crime was not new in their view it was at least a generation old this crime does have one very significant factor that has left me feeling deeply ashamed the brutality and horror of these acts have nothing to do with me they are as far removed from my life as the next persons yet i somehow feel responsible when i look at the names or faces of the perpetrators why because a disproportionate number of them are british pakistani just like me we speak the same language have the same culture and home life and were probably raised with similar values yet somewhere along the way something went very wrong this very thought ran through my head when i met two men in sheffield who claimed to know gangs who groomed girls they spoke casually about the kudos easy sex and money that follows the gross exploitation of young girls it was shocking and nauseating its important to stress at this juncture that the vast majority of sexual crimes against children in the uk are committed by white men and that this type of grooming is only a small percentage of those crimes of the million pakistanis in britain only a tiny minority has any connection with such deplorable acts of sexual violence im writing this carefully because i want it to be read carefully these men may be britishpakistani but that does not mean that this is a crime specific to britishpakistani men it was heartening to meet some young pakistani men in keighley who felt the same way as i did they were keen that i make it clear that they along with the vast majority of british pakistanis utterly condemned the evil acts being perpetrated against young girls this is not what we are one told me our values as british and muslim people condemn this altogether i often worried during the filming of my investigation and when writing this article about how they would contribute towards a terrible new stereotype about british pakistani men who include my own decent respectful and kind brothers but they along with many friends of similar background have been equally sickened by this crime and feel it needs to be condemned vociferously from all quarters since my investigation many highprofile british pakistanis politicians and public figures have also joined the chorus on the ground community workers have taken up the mantle anyone who accuses british asians of burying their heads in the sand has not met the pakistani women youth workers and religious figures who told me enough is now enough the message appears to be sinking in that if there is silence on this then the far right will move to fill the gap with their disgraceful rhetoric but as this last week has evidenced there is still a long way to go the authorities need to take responsibility for not spotting the scale of this crime child safeguarding boards need to be much more proactive social workers and police need to look for signs of exploited kids not just wait for them to come forward and the courts need to understand that these are not sexually active young women but damaged girls who have endured an unimaginable hell of rape and gangrape its been almost a year since i first reported this i can only hope its not still a story this time next year tazeen ahmad is working on a

sophie has always cursed the teacher who seduced then abused her when she was a schoolgirl but she did not realise he had done anything potentially illegal until she read about the case of yearold megan stammers who was found and taken into protective care on friday after fleeing to france with her married maths teacher who was arrested now sophie is contemplating calling the police in sophies case the teacher is still teaching teenage girls at a prestigious private school a few miles from her house she on the other hand struggles every day to cope with the effects his violence and oppression had on her teenage self he ruined me sexually emotionally and in every other way possible she says i was naive and innocent and he was perverse the sex was aggressive and sickening but i was infatuated he was this older man all the girls fancied him ill be honest we were all after him he told me he was in love with me but then he crushed me until i was a complete emotional wreck he was obsessively possessive and i was completely under his thumb i had been this bubbly strong and independent teenager he destroyed me when sophie first saw the reports about stammers and her yearold teacher jeremy forrest it brought back strong feelings then to her surprise she felt relief i have realised for the first time that my teacher was a sexual predator she says in one way it makes me feel less mad for having suffered so much over something that happened so long ago and for not having been able to get my life back together since but she adds it cant heal me or change the consequences most of my relationships since then have been really awful and violent i cant trust men in positions of authority i was predicted four agrades at alevel and had great plans for university but i dropped out of education and have never come to anything it all started with him if he had not done what he did to me when i was too young to know what was going on my life now would be very different the teacher was when he seduced sophie a yearold student in he was her form tutor the relationship was intense her parents knew about it and she frequently stayed at his house but they had to keep it a secret in school wed ignore each other during the day says sophie he dumped her nine days before her alevels and then invigilated at her exams sophie didnt achieve anything like the grades she had been predicted but still got into university then he rekindled the relationship when it ended a second time she fell apart dropping out of university and into a life of chaos and selfdestruction he broke me she says but now ive read that he did do something genuinely wrong in the eyes of the law all these years later he still deserves to be punished for what he did doesnt he is it my responsibility to try to protect the girls at the school hes now teaching at sophie however will not be able to see her abuser prosecuted for what he did the sexual offences act made it an offence for a person over in a position of trust to have a sexual relationship with a child under regardless of whether the relationship is consensual and even if the person does not teach the child prior to that act the age of consent was the only issue teaching unions claim pupilteacher affairs are very rare between and teachers were prosecuted for relationships with pupils according to reports but a yougov survey of adults said one in six knew of someone who had had an intimate relationship with a teacher while at school one school has dealt with no fewer than five incidents when in christopher reen a classroom supervisor at headlands school in bridlington was jailed for three years and four months after admitting six counts of sexual activity with a yearold female pupil it emerged that four former staff at the same school had faced the courts in recent years over inappropriate sexual conduct hollie was raped and exploited by her teacher there has never been a prosecution she has however fought for years to get him struck off the teachers register something she finally achieved in august this year three years ago i started trying to put right something that happened between and while i was a pupil at a school in remote scotland she says between the ages of and i was groomed though there wasnt a word for it then and entered into a relationship with my yearold male religious studies teacher the relationship became nasty violent obsessive and physically and sexually abusive hollies parents eventually found out about the relationship it took just one conversation for them to make her realise she had been manipulated and abused we reported him to the police the school the education department the council and the general teaching council for scotland says hollie they all received a full report from me detailing the extent of what had happened i moved to england where i was originally from no one from these organisations contacted me i was a mess and couldnt go through with prosecution but i always stuck to my story they all knew what the allegations were but none of them did anything to investigate everything was brushed under the carpet the teacher moved and continued teaching in a different part of scotland hollie had a complete breakdown i literally believed i was worthless she said i got into some not particularly healthy relationships and had problems with alcohol and selfharm three years ago hollie found the courage to address what had happened the police investigated for more than a year and ultimately charged the teacher with she thinks rape and assault but they were unable to prosecute because of scotlands laws about corroboratory evidence and the accuseds right to silence says hollie the teacher sat through a sixhour interview replying no comment to every question the legal case was also complicated because although it is now illegal for a teacher to have a relationship with a pupil their relationship began eight weeks before the date this law came into effect so they couldnt prosecute him for that she says nevertheless the teacher was suspended by the council in april and finally struck off the teaching register last month he has been put on to the list of those barred from working with children as a result of my evidence and the police investigation says hollie it hurts more the older i get she says the closer i get to the age he was the more i realise how awful it was what he did i see how he manipulated my yearold self and i realise how someone of my age would know absolutely that it was completely wrong and inappropriate to get into a relationship with someone of that age i wish that someone had told me when i was that if the teacher in question really loved me he would never act on it and i wish someone had told me that it was never ever my fault professor pat sikes of the university of sheffield has studied pupil and teacher relationships and challenges the notion that girls are necessarily powerless or exploited in them pointing out that a significant proportion end up marrying or living together in an enduring and solid relationship she should know sikes first fell in love with her husband when she was and he was her yearold teacher their sexual relationship however did not begin until he left the school when she was while stressing that girls need to be protected against predatory male teachers her study concludes that this should not be through blanket laws that have the effect of making all women into weak potential victims others describe relationships with teachers that were on the cusp of inappropriate and caused parents and other teachers concern but were ultimately a positive experience sapphire had an intense albeit nonsexual relationship with her maths teacher between the ages of and i dont tell people about our relationship because looked at through the eyes of someone who wasnt there it sounds like a clearcut case of at best weirdness and at worst manipulation and nearabuse she says in fact that wasnt the case at all sapphires relationship with her teacher grew during their onetoone afterschool classes i was weak in maths and he took it upon himself to teach me so well that i went on to study it at alevel she says after those lessons we would talk about all sorts of intellectual and creative things from him i learned that the opposite sex could be gentle empathetic clever interesting and interested i never had the slightest interest in boys of my own age because by comparison they were sexually crass emotionally unreliable and intellectually dull to this day im grateful for that as sapphire got older however the teacher became more intense he prevented her leaving his class when her grades improved enough to move into a higher set insisting that he would tutor her himself to pass the exams i began to find it all a bit overwhelming and backed off she remembers there was a parents evening around then and my dad picked up on the atmosphere between us he joked about it afterwards saying it was like wed had a lovers tiff i think my parents were a bit confused by it all they knew nothing explicitly wrong was going on and so they didnt quite know what do to about it soon afterwards however sapphires mother insisted she move to a different class there were rumours in the staffroom about us and my teacher was warned to back off she says he did as he was told but i missed him he was a really important part of my life she started going back to his classroom after school once a week we just talked she says as she neared however the relationship shifted she began to grow away from him and he became neurotic and she says slightly stalkerish i got the impression that things were nearing a climax i had the definite feeling that he was expecting something to happen after so many years of what i began to suspect was what he thought of as having waited i found the thought of him waiting really creepy and realised i had potentially got into something i hadnt genuinely understood she says he sent sapphire red roses on her birthday and appeared at her classs leaving party my friends formed a protective ring around me and every time he came near they spirited me away she says she left school and never saw him again two decades on she feels fondness and sadness for him i think he was a vulnerable man she said i vaguely worry that he remembers our relationship with pain i hope he doesnt katherine has even fonder memories of her relationship with a teacher she was when tom came to teach at her girls school she moved to a sixthform college at a week later tom asked her out on a date there werent many male teachers at our school so we were all very aware of this yearold new staff member says katherine he never taught me but all my friends fancied him i wasnt particuarly taken by him until we went for that drink two years after their first date they were married they had two children and the marriage lasted for years until when tom died katherine says laws that prevent teachers and pupils having relationships are correct he must have been noticing me when i was still a pupil at his school but we occasionally said to each other how lucky it was that he was no longer my teacher she says had i stayed at that school nothing would ever have happened between us because that would have been completely wrong some of the teachers at her old school however continued to disapprove of the relationship refusing to go to their wedding their reaction was a complete surprise to me and meant nothing i wasnt dazzled by tom i suppose i was flattered at first because he was a teacher and an older man but only for that first date she says our relationship was completely normal completely

drugging trafficking and rape the worst happened in rochdale all right the dreadful twist on the typical story of a harrowing crime is that this one was allowed to keep on happening if the authorities had lacked any clue about the grooming of vulnerable girls which eventually led to nine convictions this year that would be one thing but as the report from the councils safeguarding children board effectively concedes the warnings were there as far back as an official working group identified youngsters at risk of exploitation yet such was the guilty mens sense of impunity that when victims lashed out causing damage to a taxi and a takeaway they twice reported them to the police so what on earth went wrong the failure of the police to pay serious mind to the complaints of youngsters who came to their attention as miscreants is disturbing but part of a familiar pattern what is more baffling is the blind eye turned by social services thinking was warped by a version of a righton ethos about respecting the individual decisions of teenagers an approach that might have been appropriate in the context of a sexual health clinic advising girls with boyfriends was misapplied to a scenario of brainwashing and coercion where the police had assumed that this was prostitution the council made an equally contemptuous and classbound assumption that these young women from the bottom of the heap had freely made a lifestyle choice this is a shrunken atomistic notion of decision which disregards intimidation and peer pressure it is a nosuchthingassociety view for a social services department to adopt it is a bitter irony indeed another element may have been ethnicity caveats are important here because in discussion of grooming there is plenty of prejudice and no reliable statistics we know that the overwhelming majority of sex offenders are white but it does not follow that the same is true in every criminal subcategory different cultures do give rise to different violent pathologies the fondness of white britain for alcohol to take one example gives rise to forms of thuggery which would be unheard of in muslim communities arranged marriages and low female employment in muslim britain are indicative of at the very least different attitudes to gender there is no proven link between these and the mercifully rare cases of the rochdale type that we have witnessed among south asian muslims but such a connection cannot be ruled out a priori if social services feared to tread to avoid causing offence and perhaps complicating wider work within the pakistani community then that has proved a terrible error for giving offence is as nothing compared with the grotesque offences that eventually transpired,2012-09,drugging trafficking rape worst

the head of rochdale council will be questioned by mps over why his social workers missed opportunities to stop the sexual exploitation of young girls it has emerged as a lawyer for some of the victims said it was very likely they would take legal action against the local authority a critical review into child protection in the area was released on thursday and keith vaz the labour chairman of the commons home affairs select committee said he had been deeply concerned at its findings he said the councils chief executive jim taylor would be summoned to appear before mps as part of its ongoing inquiry into grooming the committee will be recalling the chief executive of rochdale council to explain why social services missed opportunities to stop the exploitation of vulnerable girls what is being done to ensure agencies are now working together to keep them safe and how individuals responsible for the failings will be held to account he said taylor previously faced mps on the committee in june a month after a group of nine men were convicted of the systematic grooming and sexual abuse of five teenage girls in and around rochdale greater manchester it was in the wake of revelations concerning their activities which involved sharing the girls and using them for sex that rochdale borough safeguarding children board rbscb ordered a review into child sexual exploitation in the area and the work of local agencies to stop it the review published on thursday covered the period from until this year it found many missed opportunities by child welfare organisations and the criminal justice system to protect children and young people from sexual exploitation and that patchy training of frontline social care staff had caused clear deficiencies in responses it revealed that in a working group set up by the rbscb had identified young people most aged between and whom it believed to be affected by or at risk of exploitation figures obtained separately by the guardian showed social workers and police had made dozens of referrals concerning girls considered either to be victims or potential victims the findings have sparked anger from victims and their families richard scorer a solicitor for some of the girls told itvs daybreak i think based on the evidence in this report it is very likely that we will be going forward with legal action it is fairly unusual for social services to be sued it does happen but it is fairly unusual his clients he said were deeply traumatised and distressed by what had happened to them but they want to have the opportunity to rebuild their lives the means the wherewithal to do that and that of course is part of the reason for bringing this case what they also want to see is some cultural change in social services and hopefully the report is the first stage of that but they want to press home that point and the legal action is part of achieving that rochdale council said it had put in place recommendations from the review including the briefing of more than staff on recognition and response to sexual exploitation and a rolling programme of facetoface training taylor has said he deeply regrets the findings of the report which looked not only at the actions of the council but also of bodies including the police nhs and crown prosecution service he refused on thursday to respond immediately to demands for heads to roll over the scandal i think that an investigation that i have instigated will actually bring out these particular facts he said adding he had commissioned an internal review which would report

today a report on the rochdale child abuse case revealed that some officials believe sexually exploited children are making their own choices its hardly surprising to hear that some underyearolds are having sex a onesizefitsall age of consent doesnt accommodate individual differences what is surprising is that the children in question werent exploring sex with their peers but were having sex with much older adults consider this scenario a yearold is repeatedly raped by a family friend who tells her its their little secret she doesnt scream and cry each time she doesnt try to fight him off and she doesnt tell anyone did she consent to sex no of course not why then is it such a struggle for some to grasp that teenage victims of child sexual exploitation cse dont consent either although many victims engage in risky behaviour this isnt an invitation to be raped initially hanging out with older men or women may seem enticing with its promise of free rides drinks on tap and something different and exciting but when adults use attention affection and small treats to extract sexual favours from children this isnt a mutually beneficial relationship it is abuse if a child is abused after accepting a lift or attending a party they are still not culpable low reporting rates do not detract from the severity of the issue consider for example that research suggests only of rapes are ever reported above and beyond the sexual violence of cse victims may be subjected to physical assaults or threats against themselves and their families victims may believe often justifiably that these adults have both the will and the capacity to hurt them physically offenders often know their addresses further heightening fears of retribution psychological manipulation is effective too when a victim is told they love it really during a rape or labelled a slag afterwards the illusion of complicity and guilt is reinforced some victims are deeply attached to their abusers this may be the first time in their life they feel wanted if that means they must have sex with friends of their boyfriend so be it confusion and memory loss exacerbated by trauma and excessive drink or drugs dont help matters if you are scared that you wont be believed why bother putting yourself through the pain and embarrassment of reliving it all cse victims respond in different ways including with selfharm depression substance abuse violence and aggression understanding cse complexities and reasons why victims may not present as the ideal victim is critical both childprotection agencies and jurors in cse trials need a better appreciation of consent and must not assume that repeat incidents and delayed disclosure signify complicity much progress has been made since the days when cse victims were dismissed as promiscuous or streetwise or even criminalised as child prostitutes agencies responsible for child welfare and crime prevention must be properly trained aware of cses indicators and prepared to persevere there are places in the uk with excellent cse countermeasures but just as many that need to grasp every chance to learn and quickly although effective responses arent cheap they tend to pay off in the long run if we value childrens wellbeing funds must be made available first we must put paid to the delusion that cse victims choose and freely consent to their abuse how can a child give informed consent when they are at such a stupendous disadvantage physically emotionally cognitively socially and even economically cse is not consensual it is the wilful manipulation and abuse of children who cannot adequately protect themselves this is why they need protection even if they neither ask for it nor accept it graciously when offered this goes not just for unders but for and yearolds who have for too long represented a grey area between the age of consent and the age of adulthood last week megan stammers ran away to france with her teacher initially french authorities showed little interest in the case as yearold megan is above the local age of consent this shows a spectacular lack of comprehension around the lack of consent inherent in child sex abuse cse included

social workers and police in a town where nine men were found guilty of running a child sexual exploitation ring had been warned dozens of times that local girls were at risk of abuse in the years before charges were brought in that case the guardian can reveal figures obtained under the freedom of information act show that an nhs team providing sexual health services to vulnerable young people made referrals to rochdale borough council about girls they thought were either being sexually exploited or were at risk of exploitation between and the end of staff on the crisis intervention team cit also made referrals to greater manchester police in the same period the revelations come as rochdales safeguarding children board scb publishes a review concluding there were many missed opportunities over the past five years to safeguard children and young people affected by sexual exploitation a working group set up by the scb in identified in its first year young people affected by or at risk of exploitation the report reveals at a liverpool crown court trial this year nine men were found to have shared five girls in rochdale plying them with fast food drink and drugs so they could pass them around and use them for sex the victims were raped physically assaulted and forced to have sex with several men in a day several times a week one yearold victim had an abortion after falling pregnant another gave evidence of being raped by two men while so drunk she was vomiting over the side of the bed the case prompted wednesdays review which looks at how agencies handled child sexual exploitation in rochdale from to this year with the main victim in the court case as an example agencies such as the cit and early break a drug and alcohol service for young people understood that teenagers like her were victims of abuse rather than consenting young adults and referred potential victims to the councils childrens social care department the report says but the response to cases of children at risk of exploitation was poor with case files showing staff often considered such young people to be making their own choices and engaging in consensual sexual activity often no further action was taken agencies who had made referrals were left frustrated that their concerns were not being adequately assessed or dealt with there were clear deficiencies in the way social workers responded to the needs of the victim referred to in the report as suzie with no action taken over referrals the report also details how the criminal justice system missed opportunities to bring the perpetrators to justice suzie first complained to police in but the crown prosecution service later decided not charge anyone as she would be an unreliable witness in december greater manchester police launched operation span to investigate a large group of men suspected of sexual exploitation and in the cps overturned its decision not to bring charges relating to her case the guardians figures show that in alone there were referrals to the council and to the police the review also spoke to victims of exploitation involved in the court case who described police and social services as not listening to them a common disclosure by the young people was that even when they cooperated with agencies nothing changed the abuse continued the report says rochdale mp simon danczuk said the guardians investigation shows without any doubt that police and social services ignored an endemic problem of abuse time and again the local authority were alerted to the fact these girls were being abused and they failed to do anything we now need to know what action is being taken against these people that turned a blind eye to abuse and ignored numerous cries for help from young vulnerable girls the father of the victim referred to in the review said he believed that social workers were incompetent case files show that social workers in rochdale believed girls who were being systematically abused were making their own choices by their neglect they were complicit in prolonging the abuse if they had being doing their job they could have stopped this abuse years ago the chief executive of rochdale council jim taylor said he deeply regretted that the local authority had missed opportunities to help victims this review has shown deficiencies in our childrens social care service and in parts an unacceptable level of support there was more that could and should have been done to protect the victims when allegations first came to light unacceptable practice is being investigated and dealt with we are now more able to intervene earlier and more robustly greater manchester polices divisional commander for rochdale chief superintendent annette anderson said the force had already stated there were issues with its inquiry but could not comment further while the independent police complaints commission was investigating what we can say is that gmps forcewide approach to child sexual exploitation and child abuse in general has changed significantly over the last few years she said locally with our partners at the council and the health service rochdale division now has formal working strategies to tackle headon child exploitation integral to this has been an intensive programme of raising awareness with officers which has now happened to

over the past five years i have been acutely aware of the isolation that girls and young women can feel when their needs are forgotten either because of their gender as happens within youth justice and school exclusion services or their age as is the case when they experience violent relationships from the corston review of women in the adult criminal justice system to attempts to tackle the impact of youth violence on boys and young men girls have been outnumbered and on occasion forgotten in both policy and practice girls are attuned to this gap in services they have told me that they have felt too young to be in refuges designed for adult women and felt intimidated in youth violence services this service gap has made attempts by girls who are already vulnerable to turn their lives around even more difficult so the first ever un international day of the girl next month is a chance to focus on the specific needs of girls and young women and the role that girls play in shaping society i for one am thrilled to be involved on october taking part in a speed mentoring session with young women in london nationally we are also seeing progress last week the government announced that the definition of domestic abuse would be changed to include victims aged and prior to this it only applied to those aged and above i have used this column to relay young womens accounts of violent relationships over the past two years this change in definition signals an increased awareness that young women as well as young men experience violence in their relationships however concerns remain at a local level last week i attended a workshop on girls and gangs throughout the day practitioners raised frustrations about their inability to access girlonly spaces within which to work with young women professionals repeatedly cited the challenge of working with vulnerable young women in maledominated services such as youth offending teams and how for those girls who were in violent relationships such an environment was simply too intimidating for them to feel safe and engage with the support on offer with the change in definition of domestic abuse comes a potential change in services questions remain will this broader definition result in an extension of childrens or adult services to cover violence in teenage relationships and furthermore will programmes delivered to adult perpetrators of domestic abuse be extended to perpetrators who are under or will agespecific interventions be developed for young people as international and national policy begins to shift to recognise the experiences of girls local services require support training and coordination to make these policies a practical reality and throughout this process girls and young women must be allowed to influence these policies this month i visited a girls school in durham and was met by hundreds of teenagers who wanted to make a positive contribution to society and change things for the better nationally the government is committed to working with young people to help develop its work on domestic abuse we are yet to see if this level of participation extends locally now that the voices of

we write to say how pleased we are that the government has expanded the definition of domestic violence to include coercive control report september this means domestic violence is no longer simply viewed as individual acts of behaviour but defined as a pattern of ongoing power and control by one individual over another this can include intimidation and threats to carry out violence or abuse we are also pleased the work will reach out to teenagers and young women and men this is particularly appropriate in view of the fact that the un commission on the status of women will be focusing on violence against women and girls at its meeting in march and we know the uk government wishes to ensure it has a successful outcome many womens organisations about have come together in the uk in a network to prepare for the commission and to work with the government before during and after the meeting this grouping uk ngo csw liaison group seeks to prevent a repeat of this years meeting when no agreed conclusions could be reached this was the result of the pushback by some governments and a range of powerful fundamentalist ngos different faiths against womens hardwon reproductive health rights and services such arguments especially threaten steps that need to be taken when the safety of women and girls is at stake annette lawson national alliance of womens organisations zarin hainsworth cochairs uk ngo csw liaison group in his excellent analysis of the case of sarah catt imprisoned for aborting her baby at weeks simon jenkins comment september highlights the harm done to society by needlessly sending women to prison if society truly understood concepts of risk and public protection it would not put over women in prison each year where they face far greater risk to themselves than they ever posed to society the public are not safer and the impact on the women in custody and their children is catastrophic prison is not a deterrent and it struggles to be a place of rehabilitation as the reoffending rates show its sole purpose is punishment with an impact on the offender which far outweighs the crime we are sending the most marginalised and damaged women to prison where they demonstrate the hurt and pain they permanently suffer by cutting and hurting themselves of selfharm incidents in prison a shocking total of in are inflicted by women despite being just of the prison population that so many women return to society in a worse state than before they were imprisoned is not surprising what is surprising is our failure to inform ourselves on the issues around this and to hold the judiciary and government to account no woman should be sent to todays costly prisons smaller custodial units would work better community alternatives are cheaper cause less disruption to troubled womens lives and have a more positive outcome for society mary pimm trustee women in prison simon jenkins says of women prisoners are jailed for nonviolent offences and that this is expensive for the state and destroys families while i agree i am disappointed at the regularity with which these comment pieces appear when a woman is sent to prison in a highprofile case seventytwo per cent of men are sent to prison for nonviolent offences dont their families deserve the same consideration as the families of female offenders the need to reform the approach to

the definition of domestic violence will be amended from march with two important changes the inclusion of coercive behaviour and the recognition of and yearolds as victims of abuse these amendments although they are not a change in criminal law as many have assumed are broadly welcomed by highlighting coercive control there is now a clearer focus on patterns of controlling behaviour rather than individual incidents the inclusion of and yearolds is a muchneeded development given that of teenagers report abusive intimate relationships and that according to the crime survey for england and wales those aged between and are the most at risk of domestic violence of any age group hopefully their inclusion will send a strong message to services and young people that their experiences are valid and that they need and deserve support young people aged and over are able to get married and may well be parents themselves yet until now their experiences of abuse have not been officially recognised however we must not assume that by changing the definition of domestic violence it will automatically increase their safety in the last two years of funding to the domestic and sexual abuse sector has been cut leaving valuable services overstretched and underresourced many of these services are designed to suit the needs of adults rather than young people and may not be able to respond to any increased demand for support young people also have the additional barrier of not always being able to hold tenancies or access housing benefit at present an average of women a day are turned away by womens aid representing of those seeking refuge due to a lack of space even if a young woman were able to secure a place she may not be eligible for housing benefit to to cover the cost of her staying there historically many young people have fallen through the gaps between childrens services and domestic violence services it is vital that national guidance is developed to establish who is responsible for responding to young people affected by abuse and that services are supported to deal with the rise in referrals what would be devastating is if the outcome were simply an increase in the eligibility threshold once again resulting in young people falling through the gaps recent analysis of the home office this is abuse campaign aimed at young people has shown that thousands of young people are experiencing horrific forms of abuse and yet do not always recognise they are being abused due to a normalisation and worrying acceptability of abuse in society and especially in their age group there is also a concerning lack of understanding about what is sexual consent if the government is serious about protecting and supporting young people at risk it must do more than announce an amended definition for domestic violence it must provide appropriate training for practitioners and direct schools to provide sex and relationship education that focuses on equipping young people with an understanding of healthy relationships consent and how to access help,2012-09,definition domestic violence amended march two important change inclusion coercive behaviour recognition

the official definition of domestic violence is to be changed from march to ensure that thousands of teenage victims who are abused while in a relationship get the help and support they need ministers are to announce today it is also to be widened to explicitly include coercive control which is defined as complex patterns of abuse by one partner using power and psychological control over another such as financial verbal abuse or enforced social isolation the current single definition of domestic violence as any incident of threatening behaviour or abuse between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality was introduced in it is not a statutory definition but it is used by government departments crown prosecutors the police and immigration authorities to identify domestic violence cases and ensure they get access to help for them to escape an abusive relationship the definition covers socalled honour violence female genital mutilation and forced marriage but teenagers aged to are currently excluded however the british crime survey has recently found that young people are more likely to suffer partner abuse than any other age group with of women and of men aged having experienced some kind of domestic abuse in the last year the home office says that anecdotal evidence shows there are worrying high levels of acceptance of abuse in teenage relationships at present domestic violence committed against a person under would be considered child abuse by most services whilst this may be appropriate for children experiencing parental or familybased violence there is the suggestion that the nature of teenage relationships is often more similar to relationships between adults and as such could be considered an extension of adult domestic violence it adds that recent research shows that more fluid less narrow labels are needed to describe teenage relationships in which a date can take many forms and noncohabiting couples are far more likely than in adult relationships a survey of teenagers in by the childrens charity nspcc found that of girls experienced some form of emotional abuse of girls experienced some form of sexual abuse and some form of physical abuse threequarters of the girls surveyed who had a partner at least two years older than themselves said they had experienced some form of physical violence a home office impact assessment has estimated that as many as highrisk teenage girls could be referred to multiagency panels involving the police domestic violence advisers childrens services health and housing professionals as a result of the move to improve their safety nick clegg the deputy prime minister said the true face of domestic violence was much more complex and more widespread than people often realised suffering at the hands of people who are meant to care for you is horrific at any age but it can be especially damaging for young people the scars can last for a lifetime he said that frontline campaigners the police and councils had called for the new definition so they could provide victims with the right support clegg added that the message was even if you are young even if what you experience isnt one single act of violence you do not have to put up with abuse there is help out there for you and to the perpetrators the message is equally

david albert mitchell a man with a violent history of sex crimes is accused of raping a yearold woman in central park wednesday the alleged rape happened in broad daylight near strawberry fields a section of the park named for john lennon and a destination of countless tourists and peace activists looking for a tiny bit of tranquility in a noisy city both mitchell and the woman he is accused of beating mugging and sexually assaulting had become known for their encounters with others in the area a park worker nicknamed the frequent birdwatcher moms and recalled her frequent requests for to pick up more litter meanwhile others have described encounters with mitchell as menacing and in those moments before the assault as the woman told police mitchell allegedly asked her a chilling question do you remember me it was clear that they werent quite strangers either last week the woman had snapped a photo of him as he masturbated in a forested area of the park hours after police recognized mitchell from surveillance footage and he was dragged spitting into a police precinct the woman told reporters that she believes her rape was a retaliatory attack because she had refused to give him her cameras memory card since the news broke the language used to describe what happened in online comments and tweets has grappled with whether or not the woman should have snapped his photo at all and whether or not she provoked the violence the answer to the first issue must be yes as more women use technology to document egregious behavior the more they ensure that the offenders could be brought to justice the answer to the second is no rape is rape and shouldnt be framed as a consequence of a womans actions emily may speaks for many who believe that women have speak up for their rights in order to live safely in their cities to inspire others to take action in those situations theres no right response to what you do or what you dont do may who founded the online street harassment documenting site hollaback in told the guardian friday but we live in a world where people arent always believed when they tell stories of sex violence having that bit of evidence is helpful to be honest hollaback was started in after a woman snapped a picture of a subway masturbator and was told by police that the offender was probably already long gone and impossible to prosecute the woman then uploaded the photo to flickr igniting a conversation about street harassment in new york city that rippled to other locales and has not stopped since in a video of a woman who confronted a man masturbating in a new york city subway car reached youtube and went viral may said friday that a photo snapped in a quiet area of central park this week cant be compared to public masturbation within the close confines of public transit but the ability to snap digital photos have changed a womans ability to share a story about a crime committed against her sparking a sense of urgency that might not have been there before hollabacks nyc arm logs some stories of sexual harassment and roughly one in of those contain picture evidence of the aggressor said may she cant remember a single case resulting in retaliation but in the case of the woman raped in central park asking whether it was the photo shed snapped that led to a violent act against her is the wrong question because it implies that this woman was somehow asking for it in the end the womans photo will almost certainly be used as evidence assuming the case against mitchell goes to trial police found the image on her hard drive and are presumably able to compare it with the surveillance photos that led to his arrest using digital photos tweets blogs hashtags and even apps to document injustices crimes and harassment makes the women who are brave enough to use these tools safer they can even help bring a criminal to justice and certainly spark a larger conversation about sexually offensive and violent behavior in general for instance jezebel thinks that maybe it was strange that this man was allowed to be in public near elderly birdwatchers at all in the circumstances a valid issue this woman didnt make the photo that she took public but a lot of people do may said and i think thats really starting to create an intolerance in our society to whats happening instead of thinking im the

an investigator from the metropolitan police specialist sex crimes unit has admitted failing to investigate the alleged rapes and sexual assaults of women by faking police reports failing to pass on forensic evidence and not interviewing suspects the activities of detective constable ryan colemanfarrow who pleaded guilty to counts of misconduct in public office on wednesday focus attention once more on scotland yards sapphire unit which is supposed to be the gold standard for rape investigations across the country colemanfarrows omissions in rape and sexual assault investigations over three years have left men suspected of rape and sexual assault at large and his misconduct means the cases are incapable of full and proper investigation and will always remain unsolved his case was one of four major investigations into the unit by the independent police complaints commission ipcc which is due to publish a report on sapphire in the autumn it emerged in court that over the time he was involved in investigating rape cases colemanfarrow was ill and according to the judge the recorder of westminster alistair mccreath he was not looked after properly however the ipcc which carried out an independent inquiry into colemanfarrow after concerns were raised in about his performance said their investigations had not found any supervisory failings within the met police they will publish their full report on october when colemanfarrow is sentenced colemanfarrow who was dismissed from the met police in april last year stood in the dock at southwark crown court to answer his name and pleaded guilty to charges of misconduct in public office by wilfully engaging in conduct amounting to an abuse of public trust between january and september when he was working at the sapphire unit in kingston upon thames surrey the cases he failed to investigate the court heard involved rape cases and three sexual assaults and included inquiries he carried out after scotland yards radical overhaul of sapphire following a series of scandals involving serial rapists who were not investigated mark heywood qc prosecuting said the case involves investigations by this defendant a serving police officer into allegations of sexual offending the indictment alleges against him offences of misconduct in relation to each of the investigations carried out behind the evidence stand complainants and suspects in total in almost all cases no proceedings resulted and certainly no conclusion adverse to anyone was ever reached the court heard that colemanfarrow repeatedly made false entries on the police computer to report that the crown prosecution service had advised no further action in cases he also failed to view cctv footage on a number of occasions failed to submit forensic evidence for analysis lied about taking a statement from a victim falsely claimed one victim had withdrawn support for a prosecution falsely claimed to have interviewed suspects when he had not falsified a witness statement and failed to interview key witnesses heywood said a thick line had now been drawn by the met police under all investigations as a result of the failures by the officer he said there is now no prospect of these matters being progressed in any further respect colemanfarrows activities first emerged in when the cps became concerned that information and evidence from cases he was involved in were not being passed to them in september of that year two sex workers jaime perlman and riley lisontaylor gassed themselves to death in a suicide pact at a flat in putney south london and left notes which accused the metropolitan police of not properly investigating their complaints against clients who had stalked them during the internal inquiry following their deaths colemanfarrows name came up again as an officer who was involved in investigating perlmans stalking allegations in colemanfarrow was cleared of the allegations made by perlman but after an independent inquiry by the ipcc he was charged with the misconduct counts relating to other cases it is understood the officer was interviewed four times during the ipcc investigation and said that he had been suffering from cancer during the period they were investigating the court heard on wednesday that his ill health would be key to the court assessing his culpability heywood said that issue was likely to be common ground between the prosecution and defence he said a significant part of the offending took place between september and september and the relationship between his conduct then and his health at that time was an important factor the judge gave the former officer bail before sentencing on october a spokeswoman for women against rape said this is a very serious case because at least victims have been denied justice and at least rapists have received impunity as a direct result of this mans actions every single case this specialist officer has been involved in should be reviewed the ipcc said colemanfarrow appeared to be a rogue officer and they did not identify supervisory failing however another officer from sapphire is currently under investigation by the ipcc for similar offences of falsifying records to suggest cases were closed when they were not the deputy chair of the ipcc deborah glass said ryan colemanfarrow was entrusted to investigate serious sexual offences and support some of the most vulnerable people in the criminal justice system he let them down by his calculated abuse of their trust his actions are beyond belief the mps metropolitan police service have told us they reviewed all cases where mr colemanfarrow was officer in charge and i understand that where cases required further or reinvestigation this has been done our investigation did not reveal systemic or serious supervisory failings while dealing with rogue individuals must always be a concern in any system supervisory systems will not necessarily pick up on an officer who has concocted evidence to cover their tracks,2012-09,investigator metropolitan police specialist sex crime unit ha admitted failing investigate alleged rape sexual assault woman faking police report failing pas forensic

radio s womans hour is a reliable source of rational discussion and interviews that has captivated listeners for almost years so why is it clinging on to social relevance by touting a pseudofeminist poll on the subject of female authority the womans hour power list was launched yesterday it is a list of the most powerful women in the uk as suggested by listeners and judged by a panel of generic respected women amongst them conservative mp priti patel crime writer val mcdermid and dawn oporter shes younger and therefore culturally relevant right so what exactly is the point of the power list we already know that girls run the world that gambit came courtesy of beyonc not a radio polemic doesnt forbes already have the whole powerful women list thing covered a list like theirs makes more sense on a global scale here are women who we know have power the hilary clintons and christine lagardes of the world moreover theres an irony in being implored to vote for the most powerful women in our society if their power was anything more than wholly perceived then surely we would be able to identify them without the help of a list why then is the poll looking for the most powerful women what is the fixation with power over influence or something more quantifiable the power list is unfortunately not a groundbreaking piece of anthropological research it is a perfunctory womens magazine feature rebranded for the thinking mans crumpet a way to praise already established figures in areas including retail sport and media the focus in said commercial magazine awards seems to be to gaining exposure for yourself on the website of one glossy the winner of a similar award describes her own business plan as extraordinary how is that in any way objective andor helpful to potential entrepreneurs what advice could this woman actively be giving in lieu of this empty discussion of her own successes ranking yourself against others is just something that humans do but coupled with vanity and a need to defy the negative connotations of female success read shes a bitch the power list may just read as a confused collection of people who a actually do possess the power to bring about any type of change whether that be social cultural political or otherwise like activists and business owners and b people who are perceived to have power but are in fact just celebrities tweeters have already asked the bbc to make sure that female scientists are included but do these people fit the bill are they egocentric enough to put themselves forward or have someone else recognise their potential as a powerful woman running a glorified popularity contest isnt going to help women to find out what power really means its not even going to get the bestequipped people in the country in direct contact with women to mentor advise help and inspire them its going to keep them up on a pedestal rather than dropping that pedestal and finding ways to bring interesting figures in contact with the huge audience that the bbc has wouldnt you rather have an undercover boss or a secret millionaire getting their hands dirty isnt that a more healthy way to treat power to concentrate it rather than focus on consolidating it as part of a pr exercise the bbc can help women at the moment it is looking for experts in fields including science and engineering to become tv presenters allowing a route into the media for new and informed talent the power list however seems to serve no real objective its about as culturally relevant as kony and unfortunately it threatens to make womans hour into a powerless londoncentric talking shop rather than a place for highquality programming yes we should celebrate the efforts of women but patronising them with pointless tokenism only goes to show who holds the true power when it comes to our perception of womanhood joining in with this navelgazing will only make the bbc come up with more lazy ideas rather than

he hit me across the left side of my face and my face hurt so bad he screamed at me and he grabbed my arm and he raped me kori ciocas heartbreaking account of her rape by a commanding officer while serving in the us coast guard is not the most shocking part of her testimony following the attack cioca was told by her superiors that if she went forward with her case she would be courtmartialed for lying her assailant who admitted the attack but denied rape then received just days of base restriction and loss of pay and the us department of defense continues to refuse to pay for the surgery she needs for the nerve damage to her face cioca is just one of the women interviewed in the invisible war a featurelength documentary that lifts the lid on the abuse of women in the us military and which got its first uk screening in the frontline club in london last week the film has raised similar concerns this side of the atlantic that rape is a hidden scourge in the military according to figures released to labour mp madeleine moon a rape or sexual assault is reported by a member of the armed forces every week over the past two and a half years there have been reported rapes and reported sexual assaults in the army the navy and the air force but moon believes the figure is an underestimation and could be as many as an attack a day between ministry of defence figures show members of the armed forces were courtmartialed for sexual offences of these just resulted in a conviction uk screenings of the invisible war are in the pipeline as is its release on itunes in the uk while its makers are urging uk viewers to host their own screenings lifting the lid on the extent of the abuse is vital to tackling the problem of rape in the military says amy ziering producer of the film which was directed and written by kirby dick there is a perfect storm of conditions to keep this secret she says speaking from los angeles there is no incentive to report rape it is not treated as a priority in the military and the nature of the crime means that it is so implosively devastating that many women get the blame or blame themselves the statistics revealed in the invisible war which won the audience award at this years sundance film festival make shocking reading a female soldier in combat zones is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire over of female veterans have been sexually assaulted while serving in the us army of sexualassault reports in only members of the military were convicted at courts martial rape within the military has been exposed before the tailhook association meetings in the aberdeen proving ground in and the air force academy in but it has rarely been done with such a devastating combination of firstperson testimony watertight research and highlevel interviews through the testimony of victims and their families the extent of that devastation is laid bare as well as the failings of a system that sees a rape victims commander decide whether to take action after a rape report ariana klay who graduated with honours from the us naval academy and served in iraq describes her violent rape by a senior officer and her civilian boss he said that if i told anybody that he was gonna have his friend marv from indiana kill me and throw me in a ditch cause thats how they took care of things in indiana she tells the camera when she reported the rape she was told to do what a marine officer should do and thats to ignore it and move on and she alleges the marine corps said she must have welcomed the assaults because she wore makeup and skirts part of her regulation uniform the thing that makes me the most angry says klay is not even the rape itself its the commanders that were complicit in covering up everything that happened the film shows andrea werner who reported her rape to her army superiors only to be charged with adultery even though it was her assailant who was married lieutenant elle helmer whose case against her commanding officer at the marine barracks in washington dc was closed owing to lack of evidence before a new case was opened charging helmer with conduct unbecoming of an officer and public intoxication ziering was instrumental in getting the women to open up about their horrific experiences she readily agrees that her gender invariably played a role i became very emotionally involved in the victims stories it was what drove me and i wanted the film to have that heart and passion she says ziering finds the documentary world more welcoming and equitable for women than hollywood there is absolutely no balance in the movie world it is so bleak there are so few women directors its still very much an all boys club its just horrible she says though she notes the big star directors in documentaries still tend to be mendick and zierings film has already had a farreaching impact offers of financial donations and support for victims have been made after almost every screening and when us secretary of defense leon panetta watched the film earlier this year he ordered military commanders to hand over all sexualassault investigations to a higherranking colonel and announce the creation of a special victims unit in each branch of the armed forces ziering reveals that some commanders are using the film as a training tool showing it to new recruits my real hope is that in years time there is not another film made about this were going to keep the pressure on this cant just be allowed to blow over,2012-10,hit across left side face face hurt bad

amanda todd a teenager who lived in the vancouver area died earlier this month by her own hand shortly before she killed herself she made a youtube video describing the bullying she had suffered both in school and after school that had driven her to abuse drugs and alcohol and selfharm and which would ultimately result in her suicide she described boys tormenting her and girls beating her so severely that when they were done she simply lay in a ditch until her father found her what caused the bullying that pursued her so viciously in seventh grade todd had logged onto a webcam site where she met a yearold man who cajoled her into showing him her breasts when she sought to withdraw from the mans persistent attentions he contacted her via facebook he threatened to send the topless photos of her to everyone if she did not put on a show unfortunately for todd it was no empty threat the man had obtained her personal data including where she lived and went to school and made good on his word when she changed schools to avoid the people who had seen the uncensored photo he made it his profile picture on facebook the media as well as the girls school have stressed the issue of bullying in this story but they must also address adult male cyberstalking and the influence of porn on teenage social interaction the last two issues are often considered too difficult to address in the mainstream even though their influences are very much ingrained in the mainstream in fact todds case is not an isolated one at least two american girls have reportedly committed suicide after their former boyfriends following a breakup forwarded nude photos of them a study in the peerreviewed journal archives of sexual behavior found that almost of high school students boys and girls some as young as acknowledged sending explicit images of themselves on cellphones to other students previous studies had just asked about provocative images which are not illegal nude images of minors are in the survey group of private high school students from the us southwest of girls reported having received an explicit image while of boys did the difference between the numbers of selfreported senders and receivers had to do with forwarding according to the researchers most students left a question that sought to ascertain their awareness of the illegality of this kind of sexting blank in other words the students did not understand that what they were doing was illegal how has the influence of pornography created such an ungated torrent of sexually explicit images that invades lives like todds and why in a consumer culture in which you can buy anything is it so difficult to place real filters against such intrusions as a freespeech advocate i believe that adults should have access to any material they want as a parent and a community member i think people should be able to protect their homes from imagery much of it violent that is i feel a form of child abuse when adult society inflicts it upon children porn is one such example of imagery that has come to be a powerfully negative influence on youth culture the ownership of the porn industry is oddly cloaked in mystery though we know that goldman sachs recently got out of the lucrative prostitution listings business it is also hard to establish the actual money involved estimates for the value of the porn industry range from bn a year to bn for the us market alone neither of these figures is as striking as the united nations estimate of the value of the porn industry worldwide bn with child porn accounting for bn why is ownership and revenue data in this huge industry so opaque authors melinda tankard reist and abigail bray of big porn inc exposing the harms of the global pornography industry argue that porn money has bought up research departments in universities and contributed to governmental lobbying efforts if true that would certainly help to explain the absence of any practical controls that would keep the industry freely available in a strongly filtered adultsonly space this free market inundation of explicit imagery is certainly affecting teens guidance counselors in manhattan schools as well as schools in the us midwest have expressed their concerns with me that online images sexting and homemade erotic videos are all increasingly used to torment and isolate kids especially by slutshaming girls and young women caught in an impossible double bind teenaged girls are encouraged by the ubiquity of porns influence to post suggestive racy pictures of themselves on their facebook pages or via other social media and even engage as amanda todd did in more direct selfrevealing behavior online that is then captured forever in a vacuum of any responsible adult conversation about privacy dealing with porn imagery and chat rooms or appropriate sexual behavior these girls are left to the mercy of an industry setting the bar for their interactions that then becomes the behavioral norm for both sexes in youth culture the outcome this dangerous proliferation of teenagers using technology to paint scarlet letters on girls that are practically impossible to

it was four years after the end of the second world war when reginald davies first began abusing children attempting to rape a young girl of eight or nine she cant now remember which when he himself was still only a teenager for years while living in a series of homes near caerphilly in south wales he continued in the same pattern grooming three other young girls in order to conduct a terrifying regime of abuse including raping a second young girl whenever he got the opportunity repeatedly sexually assaulting another and groping a fourth each of them told by their abuser that they would never be believed or threatened that they would be taken from their parents to a naughty girls school if they dared to complain was shamed and terrified into keeping their silence davies meanwhile moved to australia in to start a new life with his wife comfortable that his secret history as a paedophile would never catch up with him on friday that eightyearold girl now an elderly and visibly unwell woman of was in court with his other three victims to see davies finally face justice for crimes that the trial judge her honour susan tapping described as utterly depraved sitting next to each other in the front row of the public gallery the women clasped each others hands and wept as they heard their abuser now aged and himself unwell sentenced to years in prison after being convicted of counts of rape attempted rape indecent assault and indecency with a child the sentence came years after his first crime in what the metropolitan police believe to be the oldest historic case of its kind ever to be prosecuted in british courts their hope is that other victims of similar crimes will now be encouraged to come forward however long ago their abuse took place the trial as the judge acknowledged had been a highly distressing ordeal for the four women each of them tapping said had struggled to express the enormity of the impact on their lives of daviess abuse with the trauma of the trial over she said i hope that theres peace of mind ahead for them all their courage both individually and together shone through in this courtroom i hope this light will ease their burdens because none of this is their fault throughout the threeweek trial a jury at kingston crown court heard how each of the victims most unaware of the abuse of the others had tried to suppress the memory of daviess crimes and get on with their lives for decades said hanna llewellynwaters prosecuting they had carried a burden of shame selfblame guilt and fear each of the women had told their husbands but a number of the men while supportive had asked not to be told the details one told her mother who didnt want to know one of the victims the court heard had attempted twice to write a fictionalised account of what had happened to her as a child but had been unable to put the details on paper finally in the jury heard one of the victims wrote to davies at his home in australia some years later having found out about

in the shadow of the houses are parliament the chants were cheeky and insistent hey ho patriarchy has to go yelled hundreds of women young and not so young who had gathered for a mass lobby to protest against what they see as an erosion of womens rights they were joined by around a dozen olympic suffragettes who had performed in the olympics opening ceremony carrying banners with the slogan deeds not wordsleading them was helen pankhurst greatgranddaughter of emmeline pankhurst who said she believed her ancestors would have supported the modernday feminist movement it feels like we are a crossroads she said dressed in edwardian clothing and wearing a votes for women pin badge feminist activities is increasing in so many ways but within the institutions in the world of politics it feels like we are in a dangerous moment where repressive ideas could take hold she said looking around at the women surrounding her she added im hoping we will win the argument the women here were gathered to directly lobby their mps on a range of issues including the impact of cuts on women rights of refugee women the representation of women in parliament low rape prosecutions and access to childcare but the issue that appeared to have made many women descend on parliament was a recent call by jeremy hunt secretary of state for health for the legal time limit for abortions to be halved vera head who gave her age as old enough said in her youth her friend had nearly died because of a backstreet abortion im here because i think this generation of younger women dont realise how difficult it was or how we had to fight for these rights and jeremy hunt hasnt got a clue what women had to go through louise morris had come to the march with her fourmonthold daughter charlotte the first either of them had ever been on childcare pay equality opportunity and a lack of women in that big house over there these are all feminist issues they affect me and they affect my daughter she said i feel at last i can stand up and do something and try to make a difference kat banyard founder of uk feminista who organised the lobby said that there was never a greater need for womens voices to be heard in the face of cuts and threats to reproductive rights it feels like progress on womens equality has not just slowed down it has gone into reverse she said cuts are disproportionately impacting women abortion rights are under threat women are still outnumbered four to one in parliament and years after getting the right to vote thousands of women are still victims of rape every year while the rape conviction rate is stuck at its not good enough several women mps turned out to support the rally including labour mps yvette cooper and helen goodman conservative mp amber rudd while caroline lucas represented the green party harriet harman added her voice to the protesters on parliament square i strongly support these campaigners there is this misplaced belief that women have achieved equality and they should just shut up and stop moaning but there is a broad movement here that will continue to call for change she said following a recent netmums poll which found that only one in seven women surveyed by the parenting website would consider themselves feminists there were a raft of articles proclaiming the death of feminism an idea many women at the lobby found amusing and wide of the mark alex morgan who had come to the march with her monthold daughter abigail and her yearold mother catherine said that many of those who would not identify themselves as feminists would nonetheless support feminist issues such as access to childcare and equal pay i think lots of people dont understand what feminism means everyone can be a feminist men can be feminists its sounds radical but it isnt its just asking for equality and that shouldnt be too much to ask for this article was amended on october the original said that helen pankhurst is sylvia rather than

davies had nurtured a fear of disclosing the abuse when they were children the prosecution had told the jury he made them feel that they would not be believed that they were to blame and on occasion threatened that they would be removed from their parents if they were to report the abuse davies had attempted to persuade the jury that the women had fabricated their accounts acting in collusion to accuse him of the crimes in three of the women reported davies to police in australia in september last year officers met him at perth airport and told him there was a warrant for his arrest he was escorted on a flight to heathrow and formally arrested by british police when he landed hilary ryan a senior crown prosecution service lawyer paid tribute to the victims and praised their strength in

a couple of weeks ago columnist caitlin moran interviewed lena dunham creator of hbo series girls set in multicultural new york the ensuing row over morans failure to challenge the shows lack of racial diversity has been raging both on twitter and the blogosphere the continuing reactions and counterreactions to morans tweet about the show have exposed a longstanding rift within the feminist movement running along race lines the most sustained critique of feminism has always been that it is a white middleclass movement this is not true women from all backgrounds stand up to the social forces around them and are engaged in feminist activism the feminist story belongs to all women everywhere but that is not the impression you would receive from the mainstream media where it seems that all feminists are concerned about is a particular type of woman the kind that would benefit from there being an euwide quota for women on boards or has an overriding focus on body image and pornography what is missing from these discussions is a consideration of race poverty and discrimination and how they work with gender to further oppress women strikingly the most recent incarnation of the debate within the mainstream media has been taking place in the main between white women who loosely agree with each other it raises the question why are dissenting voices by black women only on marginal forums it means we keep entering the debate in an adversarial position our critique is yet again dismissed as the ravings of angry selfish black women willing to fragment the movement for their petty desires it is disingenuous to suggest that the movement is fragmented anyway why else would we be having this debate what we need is to move away from dissension into recognition of the diversity of our realities and voices feminism should not be an individualised movement it is not just about me and women like us as a movement we need to adopt a no woman gets left behind policy no woman is free until we are all free this is not a naive fantasy but the bedrock of our movement this is not difficult all it requires is empathy in their article in defence of caitlin moran and populist feminism however rhiannon and holly from the vagenda magazine employ a heady mix of biographical context and antiintellectualism to defend the indefensible morans dismissal of the representation of black women they write that feminism is and to an extent always has been a white middle class movement which must be resuscitated from the dust and the stuffiness it has been cocooned within by reinventing itself to do this the movement has to silence its most academic which is almost incomprehensible and express its ideals in a way that thousands of women understand and identify with so far so good but then it is clear that this high academic language of feminism relates to issues of race class religion sexuality politics and privilege which often end up fracturing feminist dialogue most regularly causing disagreements between those armed with an ma in gender studies and a large vocabulary to match and those without moran emerges as some latterday feminist hero whose beginnings as a white working class woman in wolverhampton in reality trumps those of the many feminists both black and white who have been calling her out to suggest that all those voices should be dismissed because we all have an ma in gender studies and like to use big words is merely another example of how the dominant group always seeks to diminish the voices of the minority such populism risks placing the voices of black women who often face multiple discriminations along the lines of gender race and class as some elite group hankering after something that is far removed from the experiences of everyday women we are both black women without mas in gender studies one of whom grew up on a council estate in bradford the point at which we say we dont care about the experiences of women who are not like us means we care more about power than feminism activists of any movement must be selfcritical and examine their own prejudices and privileges the idea that has been coming out over the past few weeks that gender overrides everything is deeply dangerous we are always being asked whether we are antiracist or feminist activists and to leave one of those identities aside this is just not possible for us this is not some highfalutin theory but our everyday lived experience going on about disability or race or class does not dilute the feminist message it strengthens

an mp who was once told to get out of a parliamentary lift because it wasnt meant for the likes of her told on monday how one twitter wag suggested she and her female colleagues get their jugs out for the boys as otherwise they were too awful to pay attention to stella creasy has only been the labour party mp for walthamstow since but since then she has already witnessed the sort of casual sexism that belies the suggestion that gender equality is an old story in politics her experience and ability to speak out about it act as a counterpoint to all those who feel that the number of female mps is just a reflection of the other choices women have babies lattesipping rather than of any extra challenge a maledominated workplace might present its not just in politics either the research published on monday by women in journalism which simply added up the numbers of men and women appearing on front pages was described as selfpitying whinging piffle by a woman dame ann leslie who possibly believes like many other success stories that if it worked for her it can work for everyone just look at some of the reactions to the jimmy savile stories for more evidence at least before the stories of the hospital beds and care home prowling yes they all cry we were all groped squeezed demeaned and laughed at it was character and careerbuilding stuff you young whingers just dont know how lucky you are perhaps this is why women such as kat banyard the yearold founder of uk feminista who spoke alongside creasy at the women in journalism launch on monday believe we are still fighting for equality more than years after the equal pay act was passed banyard is nearly always mobbed by young women wanting to find out how they can help when she talks at these events it seems to me that groups such as feminista raising awareness through social media as well as physical protest is giving voice to a generation of women who neither want to keep quiet nor whinge this desire by a new generation of young women to speak up is confounding politicians and not just in the uk it goes part of the way to explaining how mitt romney a multimillionaire whose wife has made it clear that she never expected him to help her with her job of looking after house and home could get it so wrong with his binders full of women gaffe trying to paint himself as prodiversity and choice at least when it came to candidates for a job he manages to lump all women together those women who didnt quite make the first cut read this brilliant breakdown of his speech by emma geller within minutes there was a bindersfullofwomen hashtag on twitter a tumblr and a facebook page which had likes by the end of the debate the speed of this reaction also finds echoes in the response to julia gillard calling her opposition rival tony abbott a misogynist an internet sensation watched nearly m times on youtube gillard was able to issue a rallying cry not because of her politics necessarily nor even because many understood what the man she was defending had actually done but because she spoke for all those fed up with the laughing acceptance of sexism whats more she did it with some style the editor of the macquarie dictionary sue butler is even to update the australian dictionary to include the current usage of the term to denote someone prejudiced against women and not just holding a hatred of women the literal translation of the original greek misos hatred and gyny female feminist theorists has long suggested that misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways from sexual discrimination to violence against women and sexual objectification of women but one poster to the daily telegraph accused the dictionary compilers of living out an alice in wonderland fantasy where a word means whatever they want it to mean not what the rest of the world understands evidence from today suggests that perhaps the rest of the world is changing along with our use of language and it is right to expect our political leaders to reflect that change women at least in the uk us and australia make up half the electorate after all the mp who tried to throw stella creasy and her female researcher out of the

in recent days ive been fighting a rearguard action against a disaffected guardian reader in the north of england who keeps telling me hes going to end years of loyal reading since hes been complaining that this manhating paper now has zero interest in male readers except for football he obviously didnt enjoy amelia hills frontpage report on monday the one whose headline asserts front pages still maledominated and sexist look on the bright side i say at least matey is still reading because he emailed me before dawn to complain about amelias article one which reports the findings of a splendid organisation called women in journalism wij or whinge as some of my women colleagues call it the brutes my patient response has been to concede matey some of the other points he makes fleet st newspapers are all too londonfocused most retreated from proper scottish coverage long before alex salmond abandoned england and i agreed we were late in addressing inconvenient challenges to climate change orthodoxy but on the feminist perspective i accused matey of showing signs of his age hes i wrote i agree that the paper is more feminised but surely that reflects the growing and welcome emancipation of women in most societies and in senior positions alas the downside is a bit humourless and pofaced at times well get used to it as we got used to doing the washing up in the hope of making him feel less isolated i also confessed to counting the reporters bylines on the home pages the other saturday the saturday paper is the most feminised of the week thats my impression and there were so many womens bylines at the front of the paper that i wondered if theyd achieved an historic majority but no by my count it was an impressive female to male breathe again boys im only halfpersuaded by the wij report which makes some valid points but also smacks of special pleading and a degree of selfabsorption which teeters on the edge of comic of course angela merkel is currently portrayed in newspapers as looking distressed she is the central player in the greatest economic crisis of her generation even more important than christine lagarde of the imf who is not a bloke either merkel is right to look distressed and be portrayed as such why not rejoice that she and lagarde are women of power rather than complain that they are portrayed as men would be in the same situation albeit probably not as cruelly residual gallantry persists we all know the direction of travel in most parts of the world its towards greater economic political and social power for women much of it at the expense of disadvantaged men so it should be its one of the crucial tests of modernity but as with much else in life there will be an upside to progress also a downside its understandable that some women are impatient about the pace of change and about persistently chauvinistic attitudes among men we see plenty of evidence of that dont we though older blokes know that older feminists sometimes give the impression that some of the younger sisters are crybabies who dont know how lucky they are but feminist impatience is a manifestation of growing success a revolution of rising expectations myself i cheerfully plead guilty to a bubbling trickle of politically incorrect thoughts it can be such fun like making jokes about stalin in the old ussr though that doesnt make me a loutish jeremy clarkson petrolhead nor put me in the predatory uncle jimmy savile camp either but i wouldnt exclude margaret thatcher from my list of highachieving british women as harriet harman once did in government in matters of progress women can as many ruefully admit be their own worst enemies the excellent helen pidds g report on the fallout with george galloway in bradford west allows me to come out from my bunker and say how impressed i was at the way george cleverly courted the hijabi vote in the march byelection and how surprised i was that they fell for him never mind the success of the daily mail one of my regular mustreads rests in significant measure on the catandmouse game it plays with its many women readers build em up knock em down show them powerful show them fat show them looking gorgeous then put the same photo next to a posthangover shot of them at the supermarket in illfitting jeans its great sport and it feeds on a certain type of masochistic insecurity try the mails brilliant femail pages if you dont believe me or its health pages try one of its regular then the bastard left me for a floozy interviews one of the papers most famous victims was not princess di or the duchess of cambridge but clever and successful cherie blair they made her anxious about her appearance then abused her style adviser carole caplin whose conman boyfriend dont ask shopped cherie over his phoney role in her flatbuying venture who led the pack the mail go figure that one out yet the wij report solemnly reports that the mail and expresss employment of more women writers on the front page and elsewhere might explain their high female readership levels hmmm as for porn merchant richard desmonds express having a female byline count there is an economic explanation for that which is so obvious i am not going to spell it out but dirty dick is not a good sister before wishing the wij team all the best ill make two familiar points one is that the advance of women to equal status cries of superior from more ardent partisans on both sides is impeded by profound unresolved ambiguity about womens attitudes towards motherhood my impression reinforced by conversations with women and the observation of children every day is that the desire to have and nurture children is not merely a function of social conditioning however we resolve the allocation of parental responsibilities and duties still a way to go i agree let alone boardroom power women would be more riskaverse less macho which is mostly good the maternal instinct will often prove stronger than mere testosteronefuelled ambition remember pepsis brenda barnes who quit as ceo to raise her kids she always sounds pretty sane and smart my other point is also a familiar one delete women in the wij reports list of the disempowered and substitute working class or black or even white working class and you will probably produce a similar impression of exclusion we can all play that game quite easily i didnt go to oxford or cambridge am i aware of it in my working life oh yes get over it mike get over it too david cameron its not your fault youre a toff and thus fair game how about muslim thats an easy one though jews often feel illused too particularly in the guardian its an old lovehate thing then theres scot or northerner but why stop there people who dont live in north london let alone in bradford or dont work in the media often feel excluded by much of the selfabsorbed metropolitan media in we should all try harder to be sensitive to the feelings of others

if you were to divide something equally between two children would you give to the boy and the rest to the girl few parents and no child would so why is it that when it comes to representation in the media or in politics or so many walks of life gender equality is stuck at in so many areas of public life its as if is an absolute limit that cannot be crossed theres the percentage of mps in the house of commons and the number of boardrooms seats filled by women not the ceo job you understand where just of ftse jobs are held by women theres even a club of chairmen not women of course committed to changing this last statistic its called the club for women in the media the number often comes as a surprise when you look around newspaper offices or tv stations today they seem pretty equally split between men and women and yet todays research led by me as chair of women in journalism is one of several to find that in fact when it comes to writing the news or appearing in it women still cant quite make it up to a third of all contributions not just when it comes to bylines split in this analysis of nine national titles but for those quoted or mentioned as well of the men and women mentioned an astonishing are men and women so it seems that the today programme the flagship bbc news show is not alone with its pathetic record of getting women on air to talk about the news why a study by management consultants at mckinsey suggested that was the point at which a group began to feel allpervasive the point at which people felt there were a lot of them when they stopped feeling like a representative sample of their sex or race or class below that the dominant group accepted their presence there are many other reasons put forward for womens failure to break through the barrier of course does it simply reflect the number of women prepared to work long inflexible hours those typical of a newsroom or a parliament for example does it reflect the fact that it is mothers who are still more likely to choose jobs that allow them to leave at a regular time if they can and lets be honest the sorts of jobs we are looking at here politics and journalism often allow an element of choice and not just financial necessity yet they are important because of their role in setting the national debate in changing the nations laws do i want my daughter to see only serious men as leaders and women and girls as either victims or lucky in marriage the women in journalism research is the first to look at several aspects of the front page bylines mentions or quotes and also pictures others especially the important work done by my colleague kira cochrane studied all bylines or the number of men who were quoted compared with women the th estate research carried out in america earlier this year but we wanted to look at how women are represented on front pages which despite declining readership and revenues still help dictate the days agenda for both online and broadcast news and which are seen on news stands by my daughter even if she cant read them the one area which defies my positing of some sort of magic number was the use of pictures this was the only area in which the number of women broke through the ceiling yet when you consider that the duchess of cambridge was the single most photographed woman pictures compared with for the next most photographed and that her sister pippa middleton and madeleine mccann were the only two other females to make the top most depicted individuals it seems fair to say that this triumph was not a result of any position of authority or individual achievement two women famous for their family connections and one child victim of a hideous crime the three most depicted females in an average month of newspaper front pages in contrast the three men most likely to be photographed in the month in question were simon cowell with a book out nicolas sarkozy with an election to lose and jeremy hunt a scandalhit minister in the way of much research this latest study almost raises as many questions as it answers are pictures of women used to sell papers newspaper focus on the duchess of cambridge suggests the answer is yes but its complicated are women treated differently to men again the analysis of a sample of those quoted also suggest the answer is yes do women buy more papers written by other women if the figures from the mail and the express are anything to go by a higher proportion of female readers than other papers and higher numbers of women writing the front page then again the answer is yes yet it is these two papers that are often criticised by womens groups such as those talking to the leveson inquiry for their portrayal of women evidence from the end violence against women coalition to leveson cites the example from the daily mail in which the words orgy and lolita were used about yearold girls being gangraped in a park this area of our national life warrants further investigation and greater challenge our research certainly offers ample evidence of the sort of thing described by anna van heeswijk from the antiobjectification of women organisation object in her evidence we have to ask ourselves what kind of story does it tell to young people when men in newspapers wear suits or sports gear are shown as active participants while women are sexualised objects who are essentially naked or nearly naked she said the groups are calling for new regulation of the press to ban pictures of naked or seminaked women in newspapers arguing that the images would not be allowed in the workplace and should not be sold in an unrestrained manner at childrens eyelevel would having an equal number of women writing the stories or being taken seriously within

its only when i arrive at the cafe where were to meet that i realise im not sure what kat banyard looks like her anonymity presents an obvious practical problem but the inconvenience is eclipsed by surprise how odd to have known her name for years and not her face but i think that must be just as banyard would like it britains leading young feminist is no andrea dworkin sloganist dramatising defiance via dungarees nor a gladiatorial germaine greer showoff nor another glossy naomi wolf the young woman who presently approaches is selfeffacing serious and so cautiously considered that i think she can see quotation marks waiting to pounce on every sentence out of her mouth i spend the next hour trying to work out whats making her so apprehensive in the end i decide it can only be fear of allowing any impression that she deserves personal credit for reviving the feminist movement in britain today if thats the case then her nerves make more sense than id thought because im afraid theres no way to write about banyard without doing precisely that at only she has pulled off what to me at her age had looked impossible inspiring a fresh wave of feminists without getting into a cat fight with the postfeminists of the s or pretending all the old arguments are boringly obsolete or having to make herself sufficiently sexy to be media friendly uk feminista the grassroots movement founded by banyard will be marching on parliament on october alongside other feminist groups such as the fawcett society led by helen pankhurst greatgranddaughter of emmeline and one of the olympics suffragettes when pankhurst was recruited earlier this summer jacques rogge was hailing the games as a major boost for gender equality and in the warm olympics afterglow a mass lobby in protest at the erosion of womens rights had struck some as anachronistic but since then we have seen the minister for women call for a reduction in the abortion limit to weeks and the secretary of state for health propose apparently off the top of his head a time limit of just weeks suddenly the protest could not feel more timely nor more urgent it shows we can never afford to be complacent about the right to an abortion its easy to become complacent and then suddenly we see these attacks and it brings home how important it is that we maintain a really strong pro choice movement we need to speak out openly about our own experiences because these ministers statements are creating a hostile environment one in three women have an abortion in their lifetime the majority of the uk population support a womans right to choose all the main uk medical bodies support the current term limit so its just not true that the situation has changed in any way it shows you that womens bodies are still battlegrounds it is now years since the abortion act was passed very few young gay or black people or muslims or disabled people would say that prejudice had been defeated yet in the s it was commonplace for young women to declare sexism dead due in large part to banyards activism this is beginning to change but why does she think so many women had been convinced they had no need for feminism throughout the s and much of the noughties we were sold a lie on an almighty scale that equality had been won that the battle was over and now was the time to enjoy our rights i think what really helped contribute to that was how institutions and corporations who rely on sexism who rely on womens inequality adapted and changed and coopted the language of feminism very very cleverly feminists of previous generations really got these ideals of independence equality and agency accepted as standards and values society holds dear so this didnt escape the notice of people like hugh hefner the sex industry the beauty industry they knew that to survive they had to adapt so all of a sudden putting on makeup was a major route to empowerment visiting or performing in a lapdancing club was evidence of your independence and how sexually liberated you were the sex industry held itself up as the promised land of feminism everything that feminists had been fighting for sexual liberation economic independence control over their own bodies and so forth when in fact what they represented was the complete opposite of feminism this neoliberal ideology of choice being the ultimate test of whether or not somethings ok did influence feminism itself and really threatened to derail the movement and the consequences are felt by absolutely everyone in society the sex industry of today she says would be unrecognisable to earlier generations of feminists commercial sexual exploitation has been industrialised on a global scale and the profits for a small few at the top pimps and pornographers are astronomical pornography is literally everywhere yet in reality its a form of filmed prostitution and with the average age of a boys first exposure to hardcore internet porn now just its impact is an issue we simply cannot ignore uk feminista has worked hard with other groups such as object to recategorise lapdancing clubs so they require special sex licences but the implication of campaigns for tighter regulation of the sex industry or better conditions for those working within it might arguably be that it is ok as long as the women are treated properly can there ever be such a thing as an ok sex industry no there cant you cant commodify consent the inherent harm at the heart of this transaction we see evidenced in the astronomical rates of posttraumatic stress disorder which is a result of having repeated unwanted sex because you need the money its often argued that its just like stacking shelves that it is ordinary work just like any other work but if youre stacking shelves is it a bit different if your manager says right before you go at the end of your shift can you give me a blowjob would you feel uncomfortable about that its the inherent harm of having repeated unwanted sex which lies at the heart of the problem banyard regards the sex industrys male consumers as victims too i think their sexuality has been coopted by a predatory sex industry which distorts and exploits it for profit a new generation of boys the vast majority have watched hardcore pornography on the internet so we have a generation of boys coming through whose first sexual experiences will be vicariously participating in prostitution they are watching filmed prostitution and getting their ideas about sex from it this is an industry dedicated to finding ways of getting men to come back and keep coming back for more so it tends to be increasingly violent to keep upping that response another way of looking at it would be less charitable offered limitless choice it turns out that what men really want is the most violent degrading misogynist porn imaginable does that tell us something about men well increasingly we are seeing men who are speaking out about it i begin to see how deftly banyard has learned to sidestep old accusations like manhating which have tangled up so much past feminist thinking one young man a friend set up the anti porn men project because he was using pornography at university as all of his mates did and suddenly started to become very conscious of how it was filtering into his everyday life the way he looked at women the way he thought about sex and this really started to jar with his notions of equality i think thats the only way well start to move forward if more and more men do actually stand up publicly and say this is exploitative and a mans sexuality should not be based on the exploitation of a woman and we need to take our notions of sexuality back from these predatory pornographers everyone who has ever campaigned against pornography comes up against the same problem if they want to stop people using porn they must want censorship and what kind of liberation movement calls for state control of individual liberty in terms of what we do about it i dont think there are simple answers at first this sounds like a bit of a copout until banyard points out that our choice need not necessarily come down to a pornographic freeforall versus nanny state censorship we just havent yet had the resources to develop other possibilities for me its really important just to open up that conversation the organisations that work on this are hugely underfunded so the ability to conduct research to provide a forum to develop policy has been severely restricted people see it as an inevitable aspect of our life that commercial sex is now firmly embedded in society and the point is theres an alternative its not inevitable as a society we can choose whether or not it exists postfeminists became a lot more relaxed about pornography when sex and the city widely celebrated as porn for women came along now were all enjoying it equally the argument went the problems solved banyard offers a witheringly dry smile well equality of oppression is never a great strategy for liberation a similar argument is often made these days about the beauty industry with more and more men getting waxed and manicured surgically enhanced and elaborately styled why are feminists still so bothered about body image but if you look at the statistics of who is and isnt getting surgery it is women who are having their flesh cut tucked pulled to fit the beauty ideal cosmetic surgery fundamentally is about businesses trying to convince people to get unnecessary invasive very risky surgery they know as well as everyone else does that women hate their bodies on a massive scale and the solution they offer is the knife they dont say actually we need to change the culture which is fuelling the selfhate and making women feel like this they say cut up your body to fit the culture some feminists think the solution to a beauty industry that makes women hate their bodies is more diversity if all sorts of different shapes and sizes appeared in adverts and the media women would soon stop feeling inadequate a theory allegedly proven by the sensational success of a dove ad campaign featuring ordinary women but its still this notion that beauty is fundamental to womens identity banyard says its still about objectification and commodification and the product itself they were selling a body lotion promising to firm up wobbly flesh kind of undermined their claims susie orbachs public endorsement of the dove campaign suggested to me tactical feminist pragmatism to challenge an entire culture of objectification is monumentally ambitious to make it slightly less damaging is more doable but it runs the risk of validating the very thing you wish did not exist so i ask where banyard sits on pragmatism versus principle after a long pause and a short uneasy laugh she says fundamentally everybody wants change and im not going to sit here and judge other peoples efforts i do think we need a broad range of approaches to these issues i think shes avoiding saying anything that could be misconstrued as a feminist slagging match no not at all in my book i wrote that im seriously troubled by dove i think it just shows you the lack of work thats going on to tackle this its been completely sidelined as an issue we dont hear many politicians battling it out on whos going to best tackle the harmful cultures which make young girls feel like theyre objects i went to a recent event to celebrate efforts to promote better body image a series of awards and who got up but businessman after businessman after businessman for me thats not what a feminist revolution looks like another perennial feminist dilemma is the tension between personal choice and duty to principle every woman who gets breast implants cant help but reinforce the message that its perfectly normal and sensible to spend thousands of pounds being cut open and stuffed with fake breasts i ask if she thinks feminists who do so are letting other women down it doesnt work like that she says very firmly not at all the whole point is that feminism is about tackling the cultures that led women to feel like they didnt look good enough in the first place i dont believe anyone has the right to judge another woman for the choices she makes in a highly sexist culture women have to find ways to survive and get by each day and how we do that will depend upon our circumstances i think judging other women on that basis is the antithesis of what feminism is about and we need to have our sights set on the structures and the industries which feed this culture who are the ones driving it and reaping the profits from it i dont think ive ever met a highprofile activist so lacking in any discernible trace of ego ive certainly never seen an interviewee approach the photoshoot with greater dread the modesty makes her a somewhat guarded interviewee she doesnt like to talk about her private or family life at all but her achievements are all the more remarkable for it uk feminista is galvanising feminist campaigns across the country training more new recruits in the art of activism one critic who reviewed her book complained that banyard just didnt sound angry enough to stand a chance of making much impact i wondered if that had made her angry but she just shrugs yeah the very notion of anger crops up again and again in feminist discussions either youre too angry or youre not angry enough if youre angry youre irrational if youre not angry you dont care enough she pauses and smiles but ive always found feminism incredibly

putting right old wrongs is never easy the secret casualties of jimmy saviles predatory sexual behaviour probably hundreds of young and sometimes vulnerable women have had or years to carry round the painful and humiliating memory of his assaults savile himself is beyond the punishment that might have been some compensation for his victims but another kind of compensation is possible an investigation that would require the bbc and the other institutions involved to determine whether they tolerated a culture of exploitation and made them confront the possibility that it might still persist they need to interrogate their own attitudes the bbc is belatedly now committed to an inquiry it has promised that it will be chaired by an outsider that person should be a woman preferably someone with experience of the impact of sexual abuse on its victims and the reluctance that is commonly felt in reporting it it should be conducted in such a way that women feel able to describe their experiences that will mean private sessions and a guarantee of confidentiality the priority must be to uncover the full extent of the damage but it must go further the decision by the newsnight editor peter rippon not to broadcast his teams investigation into allegations that savile had abused girls on bbc premises was defended on the grounds there was no institutional failure to explore to outsiders the bbcs own failure to protect the girls from savile would itself seem an important story of institutional failure the inquiry needs to examine not just the allegations against the entertainer but the culture of the bbc itself toppling jimmy savile from his status as national treasure is shattering for millions of people who admired his work it may be that his good works left the victims of his abusive activities feeling unable to complain but they are far from alone the reality is that sexual violence is still not taken seriously enough and that too often its victims are treated as willing participants that was how the rochdale sex grooming gang went uninterrupted for so long it is why the metropolitan polices sapphire sex crimes unit is as we have reported only now to crack down on pubs and clubs with high levels of sex assaults despite being in existence for more than years it may also explain why one of its officers is awaiting sentence for failing to investigate rape allegations properly while the reporting of rape has fallen sharply and an independent police complaints commission report into the units conduct is expected next month conventional expressions of intent are no longer enough if anything good can come of the shock of discovery it must be that a new standard of acceptable behaviour is embedded in the popular

police in the countrys biggest force are to use the licensing laws to shut down pubs and clubs where high levels of rape and sexual assaults take place as part of a radical attempt to create a hostile environment for rapists in his first interview the new head of the metropolitan polices sex crime unit sapphire which has been beset by controversy has revealed a rape prevention strategy that will target men and women it will challenge male behaviour while attempting to speak to women about reducing their vulnerability to rape detective chief superintendent mick duthie is taking action as the metropolitan police investigates a big decrease in rape reporting which has sparked an outcry from victims groups concerned that women have lost confidence in the police because of failings in the unit supposed to be the gold standard for the country this month a former sapphire officer ryan colemanfarrow faces sentence for failing to investigate rapes pursue suspects or submit evidence over a threeyear period his activities have left alleged sex attackers at large at southwark crown court colemanfarrow has admitted counts of misconduct in public office for failing to investigate rapes and three sexual assaults over three years the officer who was based in kingston upon thames southwest london has admitted falsifying computer records to bring cases to an end when no such decision had been made another detective from sapphire is being investigated as part of what one source said was a major inquiry by the independent police complaints commission into almost identical offences to colemanfarrow duthie said he was determined to root out belowstandard officers it is a big responsibility investigating rape if we get it wrong a rapist walks free i dont want that to happen on my watch his tactics to bring more rapists to justice and prevent sex attacks taking place include using the licensing laws for the first time to shut down pubs and clubs which generate a high level of rapes and sexual assaults using covert police tactics to target men who have never been charged and convicted of rape but where intelligence suggests they are perpetrators a hardhitting prevention campaign to target male behaviour and speak to women about reducing their vulnerability increasing supervision of his officers by restructuring sapphire into five or six large regional teams he also pledged to reduce what he says is the unacceptable hours it takes on average for victims to be interviewed and medically examined after reporting rape on the unprecedented use of licensing laws to deter potential sex offenders he said if you were in lewisham high street at night and someone had a glass or bottle stuck in their neck we would use the licensing legislation to close that place down but until now we havent done that for sexual offences we are looking at areas that generate high levels of sexual offences identifying nightclubs or pubs where this might happen and which we can link back to rapes and use the licensing laws against these premises duthie admits using covert policing tactics is unlikely to lead to the male targets being convicted of rape instead he hopes they will be taken off the streets for other offences these are al capone type tactics we will possibly end up prosecuting them for something other than rape we dont want them out there committing sexual offences so if they are disqualified from driving or locked up for having weapons this will help prevent rape duthies new rape prevention campaign takes its lead in part from a strategy launched in scotland last month we can stop it targets young men aged and asks them to consider their behaviour and become role models with their peers to prevent rape duthie is aware that the mets intention to target women as well as men could prove controversial we have to make sure we are not targeting the victims but the suspects said duthie but we do need to educate people that if they go out and get hammered they are vulnerable vulnerable to being assaulted vulnerable to falling over and vulnerable to being raped of our victims have one form of vulnerability or another a permanent or temporary vulnerability through drink drugs mental health age so there are things that we can do to prevent the offence happening in the first place one of duthies biggest challenges is the big fall in the reporting of rapes in greater london over the last year which appears to buck the national trend womens groups blame a loss of confidence in the police due to the highprofile failures by sapphire in the past five years in greater london the latest figures show the reporting of rape is down from april to the end of september to reports compared with for the same period last year this is a concern for us said duthie is that because theres less rape happening is it because we are intervening earlier in domestic violence or is it because there are fewer people reporting if they are not reporting why are they not reporting is it because victims are losing confidence because there is a perception they wont get justice and people wont get charged we are doing significant work at the moment with our partners looking into all of that he said that although reporting of rapes was down detections were up since he had taken over with men charged between april to september this year compared with in the same period last year a spokeswoman for women against rape said the new tactics were a diversion these socalled prevention strategies are a diversion from whats needed thorough unbiased investigations and prosecutions so rapists are caught and convicted and rape is discouraged the spokeswoman said telling men not to rape will have no effect when the reality is that of rapes dont reach conviction victims want their attackers prosecuted for rape not for some unconnected crime what makes women vulnerable is that the authorities side with the rapist rather than the victim victims are disbelieved especially if they have been attacked before,2012-10,police country biggest force use licensing law shut pub club high level rape sexual assault take place part radical attempt create

yesterday i was asked by a group of enthusiastic feminists if i would like to take part in a bit of direct action and help desecrate jimmy saviles grave in my youth i did a fair bit of spraypainting and the like and as a political activist against violence towards women and children i am well aware that when all else fails we do as the suffragettes did and get our hands dirty however on this occasion i declined to take part because a i do not believe in disrespecting a space where grieving loved ones go for comfort and b it is a waste and time of energy what we need the savile legacy to be is a major rethink and overhaul of police and other criminal justice agencies responses to reports of child sexual abuse since this story broke we have heard much about who is to blame for the fact that the rumours and allegations about savile did not lead to action by the police and subsequently the courts why wait until he was dead ask many why did the girls not report at the time how come the tabloids did not publish what they knew that would have not been possible at the time as the newspapers would be subject to libel laws that rightly prevent the publication of unsubstantiated rumours that would harm the reputation of the person involved the fact is had the police and crown prosecution service acted robustly enough in when women who allege abuse by him at the duncroft approved school reported to surrey police those alleging abuse could have had their evidence tested in court and justice may well have been done but the allegations were investigated and the cps decided there was insufficient evidence to take any further action a year later police in sussex were contacted by another woman alleging that savile had abused her as a child and again nothing happened during the time savile was still alive jersey northamptonshire and west yorkshire were all aware of allegations that had been made against him why do we keep getting it so wrong when dealing with these crimes ian huntley the man who murdered two yearold girls in soham in was accused of raping an yearold as she walked home from a nightclub in but although he was charged the cps decided not to proceed due to an unrealistic prospect of a conviction when huntley was he was accused of having unlawful sex with a yearold a year later he was accused again of sex with a different yearold and again nothing happened then came accusations of crimes against a yearold then an yearold and then of four rapes in months there was not one single court case throughout the time of the eight reported sexual assaults he went on to murder the yearold girls one of the victims of the recent rochdale scandal has spoken of how while she was disclosing the most serious sexual violence perpetrated against her by up to men the male detective interviewing her yawned loudly he also made plain his bafflement that after being assaulted once the girl had allowed herself to be sexually abused several more times by the main perpetrator and his cohort if police do not take children seriously when reporting heinous sexual crimes it is no wonder that the cps often makes the decision that the witness is unreliable and when the cps does proceed and the case gets to court the jury and even judges can be awash with prejudice and a tendency to blame the victim earlier this year a man who had sexually assaulted yearold girl was given a noncustodial sentence because the judge decided she had actually initiated sexual contact with the adult claiming she had flirted with him this is war but it is not war against a dead man who can no longer do any harm but against the police and the rest of the criminal justice system who appear to keep getting it wrong i will be using my energy not to daub a headstone if it were there any more with slogans but to campaign against police complacency and poor decisionmaking by the cps it has to stop and no amount of shouting at saviles grave will bring justice to victims,2012-10,yesterday wa asked group enthusiastic feminist would like take part bit direct action help desecrate jimmy saviles grave youth fair bit spraypainting like political activist

i was struggling in so many areas of my life recalls ellie who lived in a foster placement for three years from the age of id go out get drunk get arrested i met this guy from youth offending and at first he was a really nice boy but then things started to change id hold his drugs his money his gun it got really abusive mostly mental he used to say some pretty horrible things and even now i have some confidence issues it was pretty damaging ellies foster mother discovered ellie was in a sexual relationship when she found a used pregnancy test ellie says she was then made to go for tests to see if shed contracted any sexually transmitted infections thats when i found out i had chlamydia she says this was the boy who i thought was the love of my life it was the love i should have got from my parents despite what she remembers affectionately as a close relationship with her foster mother ellie says they never sat down and talked about the implications of her being sexually active i felt really awkward i lost my virginity at and i didnt want to say she explains it was not something that was spoken about its a sensitive time for any teenager when they start to explore their sexuality but almost by definition its harder for young people in care they are known to be vulnerable to sexual exploitation for many the sexual or physical abuse that has resulted in them being taken into care means they start from a different place when they begin to negotiate adult relationships unfortunately the question of who is looking after the sexual health and wellbeing of young people in care is difficult to answer this is partly because the foster carers with whom they are placed do not have legal parental responsibility and cannot keep information to themselves if they are concerned the young person may be at risk of serious harm children coming into fostering families will recognise a level of surveillance about their lives says diane heath membership support consultant at the fostering network though she says its right that foster carers must share some disclosures i think that lack of confidentiality can act as an inhibitor its unlikely that children will feel happy talking about their concerns if theyre worried their most private thoughts will become widely known in the team responsible for their care and though good agencies will offer training in how to handle discussions on sex education and relationships dealing with the daytoday reality of a teenagers burgeoning interest in sex is far more complex than just following a manual says alan wood midlands director for the british association for adoption and fostering and also a foster carer offering placements to teenage boys his approach he says is fairly frank we say this is what the law says this is whats allowed and not allowed the issue is about making sure the relationship between you and the young person is as positive as it can be so we try to offer them as much choice as we can and that means trust is easier its being able to create the atmosphere within the home joanna adande an experienced foster carer who offered placements to teenagers and now works at the fostering network acknowledges that some of the conversations shes had have been very difficult for me when she began fostering adande recalls i had to deal with my feelings around young people being sexually active at a very young age and sometimes being very promiscuous i had to learn not to use language that was interpreted as rejecting you often have to go about things in a roundabout way as opposed to reacting from an emotional point of view you have to be calm and professional all childrens sexual wellbeing rests on their feelings of selfworth says kevin williams chief executive of the fostering and adoption charity tact when children are abused and neglected that has an impact on their selfesteem and so they are vulnerable because of their early experience theyre looking for stability reassurance affection so yes you need a strategy to look at their sexual health williams adds but alongside that you need a strategy to build up their selfesteem and confidence a young person who is looked after may never have seen a healthy consensual relationship in practice points out lisa handy coordinator of the sex education forum at ncb national childrens bureau and because they often move frequently she adds young people in care may not have had the chance to develop positive longterm relationships with friends this gap in their experience may mean they dont have the opportunity to develop the perspective skills and sense of security to stand up for themselves and negotiate whats reasonable and what they want from a sexual relationship when it comes to crunchtime and a child plucks up the courage to open a sensitive conversation foster carers can feel very anxious about what kind of guidance they are and arent allowed to give says heath she says that all services should have an explicit policy on sex and relationships education and foster carers must know about their own services policy on what they can and cant do adande agrees fostering service providers have to get their act together in the training they provide and have a clear policy regarding the tension between enabling young people to make choices and protecting them often were left not knowing what the policy is and doing things from instinct which isnt the best way even though there are some professionals who will respect confidentiality gps and other sexual health services it may be that some young people would prefer to have the discussion no matter how fraught with potential embarrassment with someone who knows them i wish id had that conversation about the consequences with my foster mum says ellie i think it was her job to bring it up its going to be an awkward conversation no matter who you have it with but we had a really close relationship and she could probably have got through to me some names have been changed,2012-10,wa struggling many area life recall ellie lived foster placement three year age id go get drunk get arrested met guy youth offending first wa really

when i was a student at the university of california los angeles i took a class titled european intellectual history taught by a wellknown historian he promised to talk about womens contributions at the end of the semester as i was intent on making a mark on art history i was eager to learn about what women before me had done finally the last class arrived my professor strode into the room and arrogantly announced womens contributions they made none his assessment made me feel a freak how dare i think that i could go where no woman before me had trod but i had such a burning desire to make art that when i got out of graduate school where i had many skirmishes with my male professors because they hated my biomorphic imagery i worked hours a week in my studio the la art scene was extremely macho in the s and few women were taken seriously for a decade i struggled to make a place for myself but to accomplish this i had to adopt male drag that is make work that looked like that of my male peers and echoed their concerns by the end of that time i was fed up and wanted to be myself as a woman i decided to look into history to see if there had been any before me who had encountered similar obstacles this was before there were any womens studies classes so i had to ferret out information entirely on my own what i discovered changed my life it also enraged me because my professor was completely wrong unfortunately ignorant convictions like his continue to hold sway exemplified by caitlin morans recent book how to be a woman even the most ardent feminist historian cant conceal that women have basically done fuckall for the last years she writes the truth is that for centuries women have struggled to be heard writing books making art and music and challenging the many restrictions on womens lives but their achievements have been repeatedly written out of history i set out to chronicle this ongoing erasure in my installation the dinner party a monumental symbolic history of women in western civilisation it created a major stir when it premiered in originally slated to travel to a number of museums the tour collapsed in the face of vitriolic reviews sometimes sadly written by women then an amazing thing happened people in the us canada the uk germany and australia began to organise resulting in a worldwide tour that eventually brought the dinner party to venues in six countries on three continents and a viewing audience of more than a million when i first created the dinner party my goal was for it to be permanently housed as this would be the only way to overcome the repeated erasure of womens history that the work recounted it took years for my goal to be achieved thanks to the vision of dr elizabeth a sackler who acquired donated and in housed the dinner party at the elizabeth a sackler centre for feminist art at the brooklyn museum where it draws people from all over the world i am often asked if things have changed since i was a young artist obviously there are many changes worth celebrating for example women and artists of colour are exhibiting widely and are free to be themselves in their work in ways that were completely impossible when i was young at the same time many young women artists do not wish to be associated with the feminist art movement of the s that opened the doors of opportunity to them this situation is the result of womens art womens history and the feminist art movement still being marginalised in our educational institutions and museums most schools continue to run a malecentred curriculum and a survey showed work by women artists makes up only to of major permanent collections in the us and europe the new york art critic jerry saltz created a furore on facebook when after counting the work by women in the museum of modern arts painting and sculpture galleries he accused the museum of practising a form of genderbased apartheid when i was at work on the dinner party only one half of one percent of art books dealt with women more recently it has risen to given that it is major exhibitions museum collections and art publications that will define the historical record it is clear that at the top level of the art world it is pretty much business as usual when it comes to women however the dinner party demonstrated the power of art in that it overcame enormous resistance and is now part of art history inspiring generations of young people with the stories of courageous women and my david and goliath story is not the only one think of pussy riot and the havoc wrought by three young women and a feminist song the moral of this story is that even if theres a long way to go art can still strike a blow for freedom for everyone,2012-10,wa student university california los

new york is a leader in the legislative fight against sexual harassment in the subways and its newest proposition is a law that aims to upgrade unwanted sexual contact from a misdemeanor to a felony the escalation also turns sexually motivated touching into a sex crime with the possibility of jail time i applaud lawmakers effort to address this critical issue but i am not convinced that harsher punishments for sexual harassment on the subway will yield the desired effect the most lamentable aspect of taking public transportation as a woman is enduring the unsavory boys and men who exploit the shared space and put our safety in jeopardy masturbation sexual assault rape and whatever you call what this guy was doing are the more invasive not to mention illegal behaviors that disrupt our journeys women understand that most men dont engage in this brand of sexual violence and we applaud the many men who take action to disrupt this injustice when it occurs but the number of guys who are doing these things is sizable enough to make most women suspicious and uneasy during our commutes subway harassment isnt only a problem for women in new york city boston chicago and recently washington dc have all implemented ad campaigns to raise awareness about the issue and encourage riders to report incidents and across the globe in beijing a furious debate erupted in august after the shanghai no metro operation company issued a public statement blaming harassment on women who wear sexy clothing transportation in cities in egypt japan and india have womenonly sections where the hope is that separation might actually equal increased public safety still the problem persists across cultures and national borders by the time women become teens we are intimately familiar with the dangers that come with entering public space though lets be real our homes schools and workplaces arent that safe either weve been harassed and assaulted weve been dismissed by police after being harassed and assaulted weve been harassed and assaulted by police weve been blamed by judges after being harassed and assaulted by police weve been jailed for defending ourselves against harassment and assault for women as a bengali idiom deftly states theres a tiger on land and a crocodile in the water when lawmakers cut taxes on the wealthy that fund public transportation it results in service decreases that mean riders spend more time in the transit system it also leads to layoffs of transit employees who could be monitoring safety and holding violators accountable for infractions instead crime is increasing in the new york city subways not because our laws arent tough enough already but because the ones that exist arent adequately enforced hence my skepticism about the effectiveness of the newly proposed legislation a statement from public advocate bill de blasios office reads the city police department receives over complaints a year for public lewdness or forcible touching only complaints in the new york weekday subway ridership averaged m with millions of women taking the subway every day the number of complaints police receive seems implausibly worryingly low according to a survey about sexual violence in the subway conducted by the manhattan borough presidents office only of people who are sexually harassed on the subway report the incident this finding fueled a citizenled advocacy effort that prompted public service announcements on buses and trains but five years later the numbers still strongly suggest that a majority of violated riders do not make formal complaints in a climate where republican elected officials make scientifically unsound statements about legitimate rape and blame an yearold gang rape victim because she was dressed like a yearold prostitute its no surprise that victims of sexual violence choose to remain silent they may post blurry cellphone photos on blogs with semianonymous stories of outrage but precious few resort to the institutional mechanisms that have been established to ensure their safety until we get to the root of what the barriers are and take the steps necessary to remove them creating harsher legislation is simply spinning wheels some groups like collective action for safe spaces cass are already leading the way by drawing on local expertise and creating strategic communitydriven innovative solutions addressing the issues that impact on ones willingness to report a crime recognizing street harassment as a complex and multifaceted issue cass takes a comprehensive approach by combining direct services online and offline advocacy grassroots movementbuilding and education and training it works in coalition with other likeminded organizations in our nations capital and it is creating a model that can be adapted elsewhere in the us and the world our right to be secure in public spaces is at the forefront of justice movements all over the globe its exciting to know that one day this blight affecting us all will come to an end not as a result of tougher laws but because concerned citizens are standing up and demanding the right to live more dignified lives,2012-10,new york leader

no one watching the news in the past few weeks can fail to be distressed by the way vulnerable girls in rochdale were treated by professionals whose job it was to protect them let alone the men who repeatedly abused them the unfolding story of how jimmy savile is alleged to have sexually assaulted numerous girls is equally disturbing not least because savile appears to have acted with impunity despite the number of people who seemingly knew or directly witnessed abuse we know that men who commit this kind of abuse target women and girls they think are vulnerable whether through age or other circumstance they are adept at manipulating their victims and covering up their crimes from the authorities we also know that harmful attitudes and behaviours are developed at a young age and there is growing evidence about the impact of pornography on young mens attitudes towards women so schools have a critical role to play in keeping children safe by talking to them about issues such as sexual consent and how to hear it what sexual coercion and exploitation is helping shape healthy relationships and respect for one another it is also vital to ensure that young people know they can talk to a trusted adult about these issues and know where they can get support if they are being abused one of the saddest scenes in the jimmy savile documentary this week showed one victim saying that she knew she had to give something back after a nice day out we should ensure that every young person knows they are valuable and have rights this makes labours pledge at its annual conference this week to make sex and relationships education sre statutory in order to tackle abuse of women and girls very timely at present only the biological aspects of sex education are compulsory we cannot bury our head in the sand about the scale of the problem violence against young women and girls vawg is widespread it occurs in every town city and rural area in the uk and is committed by boyfriends friends as well as adults nspcc research shows that one in three teenage girls experiences sexual violence from a partner and that sexting or sharing sexual images between friends is linked to coercion harassment and abuse our own research found that one in three year old girls say they experienced groping or other unwanted sexual touching at school behaviour that would be banned in the workplace or even prosecuted routinely goes unchallenged there some problems are particularly hidden it is estimated that over girls in england and wales are at risk of experiencing female genital mutilation fgm every year and the forced marriage unit deals with about cases of forced marriage every year the impact of abuse on girls and young women is very damaging in terms of physical and emotional harm as well as impact on education and future prospects but many teachers feel they do not have the knowledge or skills to deal adequately with these issues alongside sre we want ongoing teacher training so that teachers have the confidence to deal with all forms of violence they need to be able to spot abuse so that the warning signs in the rochdale case are never again ignored and respond to disclosures appropriately our new campaign schools safe girls asks parents students and others to talk to their local schools to ask them how they are dealing with these issues do child protection policies adequately address sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation for example is sexual harassment and teen relationship abuse addressed in bullying and behaviour policies the department for education dfe is the weak link in all of this the home office leads the vawg strategy and has produced an ongoing teenage relationship abuse campaign david cameron is pushing the agenda to tackle sexualisation but the key department with responsibility for children dfe closed its expert group at the height of the sexual exploitation scandals and has no identifiable lead on vawg just think about that even now after rochdale at the time of writing there has been no response from the coalition government and so the question is with the conservative party conference opening on october how

how many children are abducted in england and wales the possible abduction of april jones has pushed the issue onto the front pages but how common is it the latest crime figures published by the office for national statistics show cases of child abduction reported to police in the figures do not include scotland which has a separate justice system that figure is down on the previous year and much lower than the high of cases in but as overall crime is going down too what do those figures mean if you look at the rate of child abductions per total offences it shows a small increase on last year from up to but how does it compare to other offences against children if you exclude sexual offences it shows that child abductions were of those offences so small compared to child cruelty or neglect which accounted for crimes this only goes back to because the law changed that year and created more child sex offences what do we know about those abductions one of the best sources is this report published last year by the police child exploitation and online protection centre it highlighted a home office report from which looked at police reports of child abduction in england and wales just over half were attempted abductions out of the reports involved a stranger were attempted abductions by a stranger and of all reports were successful child abductions by a stranger of all reported abductions were parental those parental reports are only counted as a child abduction by police if the children are taken abroad the full data for childspecific offences is below what do you

a home office research study examined police reports of child abduction in england and wales in an effort to map the situations that lead to children being taken just over half of the cases examined were attempted abductions of the total involved a stranger of which were attempted abductions and were successful a further of all reported abductions were parental usually when a child is caught up in custodial disagreements in recorded cases of abductions and attempted abductions by strangers motives for the offence are largely unrecorded but the home office paper says it is reasonable to assume many to be sexually motivated as the most common scenario was male offender attempting to entice a child into a car or physically attempting to drag a victim from a public place data collection on missing children is neither coordinated nor centralised which makes it difficult to understand the scale of the problem reports made by law enforcement agencies child services and other organisations are recorded differently at local national and international levels researchers are forced instead to gather information from missing persons data and related crime reports such as those on trafficking grooming and abduction in there were approximately reports of missing people under the age of research conducted in suggested that of children and young people reported missing had been forced to leave this included stranger and parental abduction and being thrown out of home abduction by a noncustodial parent is an offence under section of the child abduction act the principal source of annual child abduction statistics in england and wales is taken from crime records published by the home office figures for northern ireland and scotland are not annually reported in this document,2012-10,home office research study examined police report child abduction england wale effort map situation lead child taken half case examined attempted abduction total involved stranger attempted abduction successful reported abduction parental usually child caught custodial disagreement recorded case abduction attempted abduction stranger motif offence largely unrecorded home office paper say reasonable assume many sexually motivated common scenario wa male offender attempting entice child car physically attempting drag victim public place data collection missing child neither coordinated centralised make difficult understand scale problem report made law enforcement agency child service organisation recorded differently local national international level researcher forced instead gather information missing person data related crime report trafficking grooming abduction approximately report missing people age research conducted suggested child young people reported missing forced leave included stranger parental abduction thrown home abduction noncustodial parent offence section child abduction act principal source annual child abduction statistic england wale taken crime record published home office figure northern ireland scotland annually reported document,"['home', 'office', 'research', 'study', 'examined', 'police', 'report', 'child', 'abduction', 'england', 'wale', 'effort', 'map', 'situation', 'lead', 'child', 'taken', 'half', 'case', 'examined', 'attempted', 'abduction', 'total', 'involved', 'stranger', 'attempted', 'abduction', 'successful', 'reported', 'abduction', 'parental', 'usually', 'child', 'caught', 'custodial', 'disagreement', 'recorded', 'case', 'abduction', 'attempted', 'abduction', 'stranger', 'motif', 'offence', 'largely', 'unrecorded', 'home', 'office', 'paper', 'say', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'many', 'sexually', 'motivated', 'common', 'scenario', 'wa', 'male', 'offender', 'attempting', 'entice', 'child', 'car', 'physically', 'attempting', 'drag', 'victim', 'public', 'place', 'data', 'collection', 'missing', 'child', 'neither', 'coordinated', 'centralised', 'make', 'difficult', 'understand', 'scale', 'problem', 'report', 'made', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'child', 'service', 'organisation', 'recorded', 'differently', 'local', 'national', 'international', 'level', 'researcher', 'forced', 'instead', 'gather', 'information', 'missing', 'person', 'data', 'related', 'crime', 'report', 'trafficking', 'grooming', 'abduction', 'approximately', 'report', 'missing', 'people', 'age', 'research', 'conducted', 'suggested', 'child', 'young', 'people', 'reported', 'missing', 'forced', 'leave', 'included', 'stranger', 'parental', 'abduction', 'thrown', 'home', 'abduction', 'noncustodial', 'parent', 'offence', 'section', 'child', 'abduction', 'act', 'principal', 'source', 'annual', 'child', 'abduction', 'statistic', 'england', 'wale', 'taken', 'crime', 'record', 'published', 'home', 'office', 'figure', 'northern', 'ireland', 'scotland', 'annually', 'reported', 'document']",16
of all the things that need to be said about hanna rosins the end of men the most significant is that it is not entirely true even before the books us release informed critics were pointing out numerous flaws in the social statistics the international perspective the economic figures and even the accuracy of her case study interviews ive thrown in a little credibility grenade of my own here the apocalyptic case for the end of men is far from made rosins sensationalist hyperbole and slapdash attention to detail are frustrating because as john harris points out the trends she examines are all too real the underperformance of boys and young men in education and employment should be a major concern for us all so too should be the impossible strains being felt by many women to fulfil simultaneous roles as dedicated breadwinner successful careerist and devoted mother as i read rosins account of an exhausted cleaner sleeping in a stairwell after the triple shift of childcare education and paid work or of the silicon valley executives who rush home to put the kids to bed at eight before returning to the office until midnight i was reminded of sarah palins great jibe at the newly elected president obama when she asked her tea party audience hows that hopeychangey stuff workin out for ya on the evidence presented here the brave new world of female triumph aint workin out for nobody to a large extent the newly fashioned workplace is a victory not for feminism but for capitalism since the s economists have used the term the feminisation of labour to refer to the growing premium of communication and interpersonal skills perceived emotional intelligence and other supposedly feminine attributes at work and also to the development of an insecure lowpaid low status disposable workforce feminist theorist nina power has astutely noted that the feminisation of labour has been accompanied by the labourisation of women unprecedented social and economic pressures to become another busy little worker bee in the globalised hive the financial dynamics of employment rates wages rents house prices and living costs have created a snare for us all as power says the personal is not political it is always entirely economic with that in mind suggesting that men take it upon ourselves to reinvent our masculinity is little more than an instruction to pull our socks up and doesnt get to the question of why the socks might be down in the first place rosin argues that women have become better than men at playing the game of modern capitalism harris says the solution is for men to become better at playing by the rules im more inclined to think that it is the game itself that needs changing how could that happen we could start by correctly identifying the problems men are not becoming obsolete in the home and the workplace but a significant proportion especially of working class and poorer young men are being left behind on pretty much any measure of success and wellbeing discussions of masculinity need to acknowledge that a significant minority of men do very well out of the current norms and they are likely to be the ones who attain wealth influence and power as for the others if they feel unsure as to what their role is meant to be it may be because the wider culture doesnt really know either they are no longer needed as a mass workforce or as providers for families they dont need selfhelp books they need decent training and meaningful jobs many of the difficulties in achieving genuinely equal opportunities and social equality for men and women ultimately hinge upon the juggling act of children household and career much of this can only be sorted between couples or within families but employers need to ensure not only equal rights but equal acceptance of fathers and mothers working flexibly taking time off for a childs illness or appointments and of course taking parental leave even among better employers too often family friendly policies still mean motherfriendly habits there are institutional issues too from paternity leave rights to the practices of the family courts even sentencing in the criminal courts our legal framework too readily assumes parent equals mother equals woman and it is dispiriting when even modest proposals for reform meet resistance not least from some feminists many men wish to be or become more active and responsible fathers only to find they have to fight the systems to do so over the coming decades our understanding of what it means to be a man will undoubtedly change the change will not be so much in how men see ourselves but in how all of us see each other our peers our friends our partners and lovers and above all our children portray men as lazy failures and lazy failures they shall become consider boys to be trouble and troublesome boys they shall be concern about cultural misandry is usually considered the preserve of frothy bloggers and unhinged mens rights activists but the routine denigration and mockery of any man who deviates from heroic and patriarchal gender ideals in movies tv and advertising in media coverage and political discourse should concern anyone who desires a more fair and less genderbound society its rather tragic that in identifying some of these problems the end of men has added to them significantly,2012-10,thing need said

i support mark solmss plea for better research into those who sexually abuse children comment november but he makes some difficult assumptions how does he know abusers have almost always been abused themselves in a field where collecting accurate information will always be extremely difficult there is plenty of evidence to the contrary kelly et al cite a range of studies finding that the proportion of convicted offenders reporting experiences of abuse in childhood varies between and hardly almost always although having been abused may well increase someones risk of becoming an abuser the fact that many many people who have been abused do not become abusive suggests that even people who have been abused have a choice about what they do not what they become solms perpetuates the impression that people who abuse children are in the grip of an irresistible medical condition by the use of the term paedophile a beautifully distancing term that sounds technical however the implication that sexually abusing children is a factor of sexual orientation or a mental disorder is belied by what we do know that many abusers have active adult sexual relationships and that they know what they do is wrong because they go to extensive lengths to cover it up i prefer the term abuser because it defines someone by their actions not what we think their motivations are it also does not allow society to rest on the comfortable but false belief that it is about the other not of us our families our communities our societies sally plumb author the socialtrauma model mark solms speaks sense as a psychiatrist specialising in psychotherapy in the nhs for years i was not infrequently asked to see people who lay on that uncomfortable boundary between mad and bad the act of trying to make sense of certain behaviours of which paedophilia would be but one example was often seen by other staff as collusion or going soft on evil i recall being asked to see a mother who had killed her young children and was only too aware that this required a suspension of judgment on my part and an attempt to empathise as part of the act of trying to explain her behaviour i never met anyone who i believed to be beyond understanding however reprehensible the behaviour it usually makes some sort of sense when examined in the context of the individuals history the problem with the bad or evil judgments is that they offer no strategy for intervention other than detection and punishment we need to understand much better what drives these people usually men who use children to gratify their distorted needs then possibly such tendencies could be detected early enough to offer useful interventions before the behaviour has become consolidated into its final destructive form name and address supplied there is in fact ample research quantitative and qualitative which stephen hanvey chris wilson and i summarised in our book a communitybased approach to the reduction of sexual reoffending the challenge is not the lack of knowledge but what we do with it to create effective methods of prevention some of that is being done like circles of support and accountability but

it has now become a cliche to say that the recession has hit women hardest but i am afraid this is literally true reports of domestic violence have gone up since the beginning of the recession last year in england and wales assaults were reported every day thats three women calling the police every two minutes to say they have been assaulted some may say that more women are prepared to report assaults than before and that these levels of violence have always been there but these figures these everyday occurrences these women and children terrorised threatened ground down with fear are shocking how do we not see this epidemic are all these injuries and trauma invisible to us we turn a blind eye we dont hear or want to interfere in london a fifth of murders are domestic there is something in that word that minimises the killing of a woman by a man something we dont much want to talk about this is hardly a sexy issue sure we would all rather discuss fashions in pubic hair or the perfect age to have a baby or the best recipe for fishcakes i am sorry to bring this awkward stuff up for the only way we do discuss it is via rihannas relationship with chris brown she appears locked into this coupling as a rebellion based on some twisted notion of her own taboobusting independence she is unapologetic i suppose confused or abused would not work as a raunchy album title such celebrity defiance remains a far cry from the women too beaten up to leave the house or those who flee in the dead of night with their children numb with fear and who are currently being turned away by homeless persons units this week however in london the metropolitan police want the men who do these things also to feel the fear a series of dawn raids operation athena have taken place across the capitals boroughs warrants targeting prolific and dangerous offenders have so far resulted in arrests this is part of a campaign to remind us that we should interfere if we suspect anything you make the call well make it stop call there are ads and films set in what is meant to be a neighbours lounge where the sound of an incident can be heard it is hoped to show people that a call can save lives the police are to be congratulated on this proactive approach and certainly the last time i called the police when i saw a man threatening a woman in the street they showed up quickly and took it seriously years ago this simply didnt happen the police have realised that bringing the murder rate down is in part about making precisely these interventions but despite public pronouncements last december from the assistant commissioner for the met simon byrne our approach is very simple if you commit a crime and we have evidence then we will put you before the courts and kit malthouse then deputy mayor for policing there is nothing more intolerable than the hideous violence carried out behind closed doors by so called loved ones the harsh reality is that if austerity produces more violence it is also cutting drastically all the services that deal with the effects of that violence a largely male cabinet has pushed through a series of cuts that in effect stop funding to rape crisis centres refuges and services for trafficked women sometimes this is called the womens sector but of course it deals with children too and it is being decimated last year womens aid reported that on a typical day it was turning away women and children from refuges women who had been raped were told to go and sleep at the occupy camp charities that work with the perpetrators of violence essential work have lost at least half their funding cuts in housing benefits and legal aid women now have to prove they are at high risk of violence in order to get it were described in january as a perfect storm by nicola harwin then chief executive of womens aid a crisis for the womens sector that is referred to without irony as a soft target government figures such as lynne featherstone mouth platitudes about ending violence against women while forcing these cuts upon local authorities featherstone the home office minister for equality has called upon local authorities not to make disproportionate cuts its too late women are staying in violent situations because it is a straight choice between that or homelessness where women are abused so are children when you cut off the escape routes for these people you condemn more than one generation to a life of fear reporting domestic violence is one thing giving families somewhere to escape to is another tory moralising about cuts to benefits forcing women into partnerships are another blow once again the effects of recession are borne by those with the least power not only are female bodies always the soft target for the hard man the services that would protect us unglamorous and invisible remain an even softer one fiscal violence is another fist in the face this article was amended on november to clarify that kit malthouse is no longer londons deputy mayor for policing and that nicola harwin is no longer chief executive of womens aid it was also amended to clarify that the quoted comments by malthouse and

in a month where the realities of child sexual exploitation have loomed large in the public consciousness the office of the childrens commissioner occ report of its inquiry into child sexual exploitation last week reminded us of the importance of listening to and taking seriously the voices of children in the midst of increased awareness of the abuse of children it is critical that professionals consider what needs to be done to better protect children and implement many of the reports recommendations many point towards police forces childrens services health education and other partner agencies looking for victims rather than waiting for children to tell someone what is happening to them while this may seem a reasonable and sensible approach to take it is rare the way sexual violence is identified and policed in most parts of the country is that professionals wait for a complaint or allegation to be made then it is investigated it is rare for children who are sexually exploited to simply walk up to someone and tell them what is happening to them particularly in the immediate aftermath of an assault when children do tell it can take them months if not years to feel able to say or even realise what is happening academics and organisations have consistently articulated how many sexually exploited children struggle to understand or identify that they are actually being exploited it is unsurprising therefore that agencies that wait for children to talk before they act reported few or no victims of sexual exploitation in their local areas the report clearly showed that the only difference between agencies that identified hundreds of victims and agencies that identified few was that some were committed to finding victims and others waited for victims to find them a willingness to find crimes in addition to investigate the ones that are reported is a completely different method of policing sexual violence to find the victims of sexual exploitation one has to look for the signs expert guidance to safeguard children from sexual exploitation assessment of localised grooming and the occ report have built up an evidence base on these signs they include going missing repeatedly suffering physical injuries most frequently cigarette burns and slash wounds misusing drugs and alcohol being in receipt of unexplained gifts such as mobile phones offending alongside those who are hurting them selfharm and a rapid change in appearance professionals hold different pieces of the warning signs jigsaw across youth justice education health childrens social care and the police along with parents and carers as a result proactive investigation is the responsibility of many individuals and teams outside of and including the police commitment from a range of partners to lift the stone and work together to understand and tackle all that is hidden underneath is imperative for preventing child sexual exploitation in the long term at the core of last weeks report and the recommendations that it made was a call to change the way we think about describe and identify sexual violence in a way that puts children first listening to what they say through their behaviour as well as their words and taking this seriously through action is the only way to prevent the rape and abuse of children,2012-11,month reality child sexual exploitation loomed large public

one of the things stalkers do explains alexis bowater chief executive of the network for surviving stalking nss is wrap their victims in a cloak of darkness and make then feel no one will believe them bowater should know in a then yearold man called alexander reeve was jailed after launching a sustained stalking campaign against her the former itv newsreader was sent more than emails with violent and sexual content some threatening her and her unborn child and even fake bomb threats she feared she was being followed home and installed a panic button in her house oday her persecutor is out of jail but bowater still considers herself lucky i had an excellent police force cps and a fantastic judge they understood the crime too often she says victims of stalking are not believed or their fears are brushed off this could be set to change after new legislation was introduced this week which makes stalking a specific offence for the first time previously such behaviour was dealt with under existing harrassment laws the same legislation bowater points out that covered neighbour disputes this she says led to confusion among victims but also police officers in properly identifying the crime one of the big problems is encouraging victims to come forward some wait until they have experienced incidents of unwanted behaviour before reporting them then they can find it hard to be taken seriously when they go to the police stalking leads to serious crimes such as rape and murder but it was being lumped in with disputes over hedges part of the problem she says is the fact that stalkers are too often seen as rejected suitors rather than criminals we are socialised through romantic films to think that the guy will always eventually get the girl bowater says but stalking is not a romcom gone wrong it is serious and pathological experts will tell you that most normal healthy people at the end of a relationship will indulge in romantic behaviour begging and pleading and trying to get your partner back whats not normal is when it goes on beyond two weeks thats when you tip into pathological behaviour about half of all stalkers are complete strangers with one in six women and one in men subjected to stalking within their lives bowater says the new legislation which can lead to prison terms of six months or five years for convictions that involve a fear of violence or serious distress could help people realise the seriousness of the crime since working at the nss i have learned stalking is a much bigger problem than i ever realised it is a crime that steals peoples lives from them and sometimes even causes them to take their own lives it is a precursor to so many other major crimes as long as it remains invisible people wont recognise it for what it is victims she says often need considerable courage to break their silence stalkers are highly manipulative people they lock themselves in to a relationship with a victim against the victims will and then frighten them this is why she says the new legislation must not be the end of the road this is just the beginning of a wide range of measures that need to be brought in in order to tackle this problem seriously stalkers will repeatoffend until they are treated so there needs to be mandatory treatment and there needs to be better support for victims when they are going through the courts and also counselling services they need help to get their lives back on track if youve been affected by the issues raised in this piece you may want to contact the suzy lamplugh trusts stalking

the crown prosecution service has announced plans to crack down on those who compel young girls to undergo female genital mutilation a criminal offence for nearly years for which there has never been a prosecution there has been growing concern that the practice continues to take place in the uk and that young girls are taken abroad by their families to undergo it the very few attempts to bring a prosecution have all ended in failure keir starmer director of public prosecutions has now published an action plan in an attempt to turn the tide its critical that everything possible is done to ensure we bring the people who commit these offences against young girls and women to justice and this action plan is a major step in the right direction he said everyone who can play a part in stopping female genital mutilation from the doctor with a suspicion that an offence has been committed and the police officer investigating the initial complaint to the prosecutor taking a charging decision needs to know what to do to improve detection rates strengthen investigations and for the part of the cps to start getting these offenders into court i am determined that the cps should play a key role in ensuring that the impunity with which these offenders have acted will end the first step is to gather good data on the potential scale of the problem says the cps it then intends to look at the allegations that have fallen by the wayside to see what has hindered the investigation and prosecution it will attempt to learn from prosecutions in other countries and ensure police and prosecutors work closely together from the very start of investigations carrying out or assisting female genital mutilation has been a criminal offence since the law was made tougher in with the passing of the female genital mutilation act which makes it an offence for uk citizens of permanent residence to take a child abroad for cutting even where the practice is legal the maximum penalty is years imprisonment but only three cases have ever been referred to the cps the first in and not one of them made it to court in the first case the victim gave conflicting accounts of what happened where it took place and who carried it out in the second there was an allegation that a girl was at risk but no evidence was found to support a charge the third was a sting mounted by a woman posing as the aunt of two young girls who recorded conversations with two doctors in birmingham who were allegedly willing to operate on them the doctors were arrested but the woman refused to sign the draft statement and says the cps there were inconsistencies in her account prosecutions for female mutilation are particularly difficult because they could require a girl to implicate her own parents in a crime there are also cultural taboos and communities may stay silent or close ranks it is also hard to obtain reliable evidence if the crime is carried out abroad but midwives who often see the result of fgm in women in childbirth years later are delighted that the cps is taking a tougher line louise silverton director for midwifery for the royal college of midwives said she warmly welcomed the groundbreaking action by the cps it concerns me that so many uk midwives are seeing cases of fgm and we need to have good mechanisms in place for midwives to report and take appropriate actions about fgm the rcm takes a zero tolerance stance on fgm and will continue to work to see this practice stopped in the uk we look forward to continuing to work with the director for public prosecutions about the action plan she said the labour mp diane abbott said i really welcome this the issue has lurked in the shadows for too long and i think its got to be brought into mainstream consciousness more

the interim report into child sexual exploitation by gangs and groups by the office of the childrens commisioner is timely coming just a week after contentious comments in the house of commons on grooming by kris hopkins conservative mp for keighley in the bradford district his reference to gangs of muslim men raping white kids has certainly earned him headlines which are always so muchvalued by politicians but the report shows that the picture is much more complex the twoyear inquiry finds that children and young people were confirmed victims of child sexual exploitation in gangs or groups in the month period from august to october critically these appalling criminal acts were not carried out against children from any particular background or part of the country but there was a higher rate of victimisation amongst black and minority ethnic children than had been previously identified were from black and minority ethnic backgrounds the inquirys warning against viewing the issue through a racial or religious lens is clear on the basis of the following facts based on current data perpetrators and victims come from all ethnic groups the ethnicity and faith of perpetrators was not recorded by the police the assiduous targeting of nonwhites could explain the high proportion of asian perpetrators relative to the size of the population and finally the model of asian grooming represents just one pattern of child sexual exploitation hopkins has a sizable british asian population in keighley which only recently suffered a visit by the english defence league whose attempts at destabilising our communities are always on the lookout for succour the harm of rash comments goes further in risking serious damage to the carefullyconstructed efforts by all communities and public institutions in bradford to rebuild trust and confidence following the riots in the city kris hopkins knows bradford and the diverse communities that are part of its rich multicultural fabric intimately he was a city councillor between and was the portfolio holder for social services and council housing before taking on the corporate portfolio as deputy leader and leader of the council throughout his career in local politics he has worked closely with the police health representatives and the child safeguarding team alongside the cases of vulnerable young white girls who are at risk of grooming he must be aware that young pakistani and bangladeshi girls in his constituency are as likely to be sexually exploited but much less likely to report this heinous crime for family religious and cultural reasons by presenting the problem primarily through a white girlmuslim gang lens he does victims an injustice and even impedes efforts to keep children safe in the context of west yorkshire the data from the freedom of information request that my organisation just west yorkshire submitted relating to the conviction rate of grooming offences shows that over the last three years to may only five asian men were charged across bradford calderdale leeds wakefield and kirklees the breakdown across ethnic categories is as follows white north european black one and asian five just has submitted a further freedom of information request for grooming figures up to november even if the number of asian perpetrators shows a spike as it most likely will in the light of trials due early next year of eight asian men apprehended on charges of grooming the data should be used to develop clear intervention strategies to tackle child sexual exploitation using best practice approaches rather than making the matter a divisive ethnic issue those who have worked with kris hopkins in local government know him to be a rising star in the conservative party but one with only a slim majority which a percent swing would deliver back to labour in the next general election there are many temptations for a politician in such a position but if he really wishes to scale the political heights he would do well to remembered his maiden speech in which he declared to his constituents that he has the privilege of representing a beautiful place which is immensely diverse with a huge populace and huge social issues that need to be addressed meanwhile the issue adds to evidence that institutional islamaphobia has become part of the political culture embedded in the heart of how governments across the political mainstream have come to view muslim communities as the other senior whithall sources have challenged the reports findings on the grounds that they are halfbaked and fail to acknowledge the problem of pakistani men systematically targeting young white girls this disregard of the reports methodology and analysis which drew on evidence from experts academics and practitioners does victims a huge disservice it also has the potential to undermine the final report which will be published next autumn and will focus on what measures are required to prevent children from being sexually exploited and how they should be implemented ratna lachman is director of just west yorkshire which promotes racial justice civil liberties and human rights in the north

nazir afzal readily acknowledges that his cultural heritage played a part in getting nine men convicted of running a child exploitation ring in rochdale earlier this year he famously reopened the case against the gang of asian men that groomed young girls for sex shortly after his appointment as head of the crown prosecution service cps in the northwest of england and he suggests that being an asian himself made it easier to take that step my pakistani heritage helped cut through barriers within the black and minority ethnic communities he says and white professionals oversensitivity to political correctness and fear of appearing racist may well have contributed to justice being stalled fresh evidence had been uncovered linking sexually abused minors to the accused and afzal felt that only by reexamining the original evidence could the jigsaw be completed and justice be done his action taken against a backdrop of farright propaganda reversed a cps decision taken two years earlier not to prosecute the men much of the local nighttime economy across the northwest the allnight takeaways taxiranks and minicab firms is run by south asians among them a group of men was grooming young teenage girls for sex they were found guilty of offences including rape and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with girls under the age of nationwide problem afzal has always been clear however that child sexual abuse is a problem in all communities pointing out that of the uks sex offenders are white males a hardhitting investigation by the childrens commissioner for england into child sexual exploitation published wednesday demonstrates that far from being a oneoff case grooming such as that uncovered in rochdale could be perpetrated by people in every town and city in the uk regardless of race afzal says the issues centre not upon race but upon crime upon predators and their prey and the difficulties of eking out evidence for these hidden crimes which until recently wouldnt have even reached court in rochdale when some of the teenage girls eventually spoke out against the abusers they had mistaken for friends and lovers their chaotic lives resulted in them being branded unreliable few listened the childrens team at rochdale councils social services was found to have missed numerous chances to stop the abuse afzal outlined societys dismal failure to protect vulnerable young women and girls from sexual exploitation to a home affairs select committee last week he pinpointed the dismissal of victims at every stage by those expected to safeguard them from the school nurse social worker and teacher unwilling to act on information to the investigator or family member refusing to believe moreover as childrens testimony is subject to the same standards as that of adults he said it was unsurprising that the vast majority of child sexual abuse victims required professional help to gather courage for giving evidence one of the young ladies in rochdale said im a tramp why should anybody believe me so we had to build her selfesteem and her confidence never mind provide her with the bespoke witness care that we do he told the committee following afzals role in bringing the perpetrators to justice in rochdale keir starmer the director of public prosecutions appointed him to head his newly formed national network of specialist prosecutors for child abuse and sexual exploitation afzal told the select committee that another men had already been charged in the northwest in relation to this type of activity he is determined to see many more abusers convicted im aware of dozens more child victims and dozens more perpetrators in the northwest wholl be brought to justice if i have my way he says our efficiency and accuracy will be improved by challenging the mindset that believes proving sexual assault is difficult he says we must remove cynicism from our minds and look for the strengths not just the weakness of a case if you begin your decisionmaking with cynicism then the truthful will struggle to convince you the untruthful can always be investigated thoroughly every single victim requires care and support whether were actively helping or not theyre still suffering theres no room for prejudice and making assumptions despite the high profile of recent child sexual abuse cases they constitute less than of afzals caseload when we meet he is jetlagged just back from the us where he has been advising the us state department on how to tackle honourbased violence ten years ago traumatic accounts of womens suffering within his own pakistani community in the uk inspired him to give a voice to the voiceless and champion the vulnerable as the cps lead on violence against women and forced marriage he is the person that television producers consult for advice on honourbased violence and he has worked on eastenders spooks and law amp order uk moreover he was instrumental in getting the home office to work with honourbased violence charity karma nirvana to set up the first asian womens national hotline since up to asian women a year have contacted it for immediate informed guidance that first phone contact is crucial for signposting a woman towards help as risks can escalate unimaginably afzal explains passionately she must be prepared to give up family home friendships city even her country as parents and bounty hunters rarely stop tracking down their errant child the us recognises the success of the hotline and intends to adopt a version with afzals help while our knowledge of tackling honourbased crimes is being exported across the atlantic we have just imported the us idea of politically elected crime commissioners afzal says he will work with the three police and crime commissioners pccs in the northwest elected last week to ensure police priorities are agreed with the cps and informed by them he envisages that the pccs will commission services appropriate to each victims needs in hindsight having a pcc in post might have helped the girls in rochdale he suggests because they might have received better support which would have made a stronger case for the cps but it would not necessarily have speeded up the judicial process because the timing of trials is outside the control of the pccs motivation one of seven children afzal was born in the uk to a patriotic pashtun exbritish army tea wallah he was the first to attend school the childhood he experienced in birminghams closeknit pakistani community developed his thirst for justice countering racist taunts with words unobtrusively sewing together clothes torn by bullies and realising that jealousy greed intolerance and insecurity could motivate anyone of any background to commit crime afzal saw the law as his route to effecting change now he fills his spare time talking to schools interfaith groups agencies and businesses to instil greater trust in the cps as a result he says the asian community which has faced criticism for being in denial about men of pakistani origin grooming white girls for sex is keen to work with the police and the cps to root out miscreants but as he sees it this is just a part of the jigsaw key to dealing with these hidden crimes is looking for them believing the victims and then for agencies to join the dots to consider what that information

thousands of children are raped and abused each year with many more cases going unreported by victims and unrecorded by the authorities according to an official study presented as the most comprehensive inquiry to date of the scale and prevalence of child sexual exploitation in england the disturbing and at times horrific study which describes a range of traumatic and violent sexual crimes perpetrated mainly against girls by male teenage gang members and groups of older men was described as a wakeup call for safeguarding professionals by the office of the childrens commissioner for england occe it draws an alarming picture of serious sexual crimes against children girls groomed then drugged and raped at seedy parties in private homes and warehouses organised by groups of men for profit or pleasure assaults in public parks schools and alleyways by gang members influenced by violent pornography and intent on threatening punishing or controlling young women by means of forced oral sex and anal and vaginal rape the report says that victims commonly suffer serious physical and emotional harm as a result of their experiences including severe mental illness and drug and alcohol problems some victims contract sexually transmitted diseases become pregnant have terminations or suffer miscarriages the reality is that each year thousands of children in england are raped and abused by people seeking to humiliate violate and control them the impact on their lives is devastating said the inquiry chair deputy childrens commissioner sue berelowitz the inquiry was established in to investigate what it saw as mounting concern about child sexual exploitation the inquiry team comprising academics and senior safeguarding professionals from the police nhs and charities collected data and evidence from local authorities police forces and primary care trusts it took oral evidence from professionals and sexually exploited children across the country it concluded that too often police local authorities and other safeguarding agencies have failed to spot or act on the warning signs of sexual exploitation despite what it says is years of evidence that large numbers of children are being sexually exploited in the uk too many child victims are not getting the protection and support they need writes berelowitz in the foreword to the report it criticises safeguarding professionals who labelled victims as promiscuous or asking for it this worrying perspective suggested officials too often assumed that sexually exploited children many of whom exhibited disruptive or aggressive behaviour were complicit in and responsible for their own abuse debbie jones president of the association of directors of childrens services said it is clear that we cannot make assumptions about victims or perpetrators based on their age ethnicity or whether they are in care making such assumptions will risk some children not being identified as being sexually exploited and not receiving the protection that they so desperately need the inquirys interim report published by the occe says that despite media attention surrounding a number of highprofile court cases involving groups of pakistani men and white british female victims sexual exploitation was widespread the available evidence was not robust enough to prove that perpetrators belonged disproportionately to a particular ethnic group the vast majority of the perpetrators of this terrible crime are male they range in age from as young as to old men they come from all ethnic groups and so do their victims contrary to what some may wish to believe writes berelowitz the study found the largest group of perpetrators were classed as white males but because there were gaps in official data recording and because many victims found it hard to identify their attackers it was impossible to estimate accurately who and how many people were sexually exploiting children what all perpetrators have in common regardless of the differences in age ethnicity or social background information on disability or sexual orientation was rarely available was their abuse of power in relation to their victims and that the vast majority were male the report said although it identified children and young people as confirmed victims of sexual exploitation in gangs or groups over a month period and estimated that children were at high risk of sexual exploitation during a month period the report said this was an undercounting of the true scale of the problem the report did not consider cases of sexual exploitation by lone perpetrators anne marie carrie chief executive of barnardos which works with victims of child sexual exploitation each year agreed that the figures were undercounted we agree with the occe that it is likely that the figures of both confirmed victims and those at high risk only show us the tip of the iceberg all kinds of children and young people both male and female and across a range of ethnic backgrounds were sexually exploited the report found although vulnerable youngsters in care or from dysfunctional families were most at risk children from loving and secure homes were also abused by gangs and groups the characteristics common to all victims are not their age ethnicity disability or sexual orientation rather their powerlessness and vulnerability the report states the study found that of the victims reported to the inquiry were from black and minority ethnic backgrounds the report says this information is significant given that the general perception appears to be that sexual exploitation by groups in particular is primarily a crime against white children technology was used widely to initiate organise and maintain child sexual exploitation victims reported being harassed through text messages and perpetrators would often film and distribute incidents of rape via smartphones and social networking younger perpetrators had in many cases been exposed to violent pornography the inquiry found and it speculated that this informed abusers understanding of sexual relationships berelowitz writes we need to ask why so many males both young and old think it is acceptable to treat both girls and boys as objects to be used and abused we need to know why so many adults in positions of responsibility persist in not believing these children when they try to tell someone what they have endured this article was amended on december the original said there was no evidence that perpetrators belonged disproportionately to a particular ethnic group this has been corrected to say the available evidence was not robust enough to prove that perpetrators belonged disproportionately to a particular ethnic group,2012-11,thousand

as many as children a day are at risk of rape violence and sexual exploitation at the hands of gangs who prey on their vulnerability according to the biggest study of its kind carried out in england local authorities police forces and health professionals are ignoring warning signs displayed by atrisk teenagers who are too often seen as problematic or complicit in their own abuse warns the report completed for office of the childrens commissioner the inquiry into child sexual exploitation in gangs and groups said the shocking reality in england was thousands of children were being raped and exploited in gangs and in organised parties but many thousands more were falling through cracks in a system that was failing to protect them the inquirys interim report found that children had been sexually exploited in a month period form august to october but the real figure was likely to be far greater because of lack of data and confusion in reporting sexual exploitation as many as children were identified as being at high risk of sexual exploitation displaying three or more warning signs including running away from home drug or alcohol misuse and criminality the inquiry ordered by the government and launched in october last year has been led by deputy childrens commissioner sue berelowitz who said the interim report had to be a wakeup call there is no doubt that children are slipping through the net right now across england she said too many practitioners are not aware of the warning signs and are failing to take actionit is time for everybody to wake up despite highprofile cases in derby and rochdale of asian men grooming white girls for sex berelowitz warned the focus on ethnicity could see victims fall through the net the largest number of the perpetrators identified were white while just under a third were asian it is desperately important that agencies dont think there is only one model of exploitation because if they do they will miss both victims and perpetrators she said a department for education spokesperson said its action plan was helping raise awareness prosecute abusers and protect children we expect lscbs local safeguarding children

listening to a young person talk about their experience of being groomed and abused is chastening and humbling each story is unique to that child but all are tales of sadness of wanting to be loved and to belong and then of experiencing horrific sexual violence of being violated raped and misused on a relentless basis and often for years our inquiry into the scale and prevalence of the sexual exploitation of children and young people in gang or group contexts which reports its initial findings today discovered more than confirmed victims over months and at severe risk of abuse over months the true figure will almost certainly be higher because we did not receive evidence from all agencies who support the victims the consequences of abuse can be devastating selfharm sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy physical injuries drug and alcohol abuse serious mental health problems and offending and violent behaviour in both gang and group contexts children from as young as are preyed upon by those who are stronger and more powerful they are drawn into webs of sexual physical and psychological violence from which it is extraordinarily difficult to escape one girl we heard from was groomed and raped from the age of and had become dependent on her exploiters for the drugs and alcohol to which she had become addicted towards the end of her seven years of abuse she was expected to provide new victims for her network of exploiters if she failed to do this she was repeatedly raped for most of this time she was in local authority care another girl was sexually abused between the ages of four and nine by several male family members this was not identified by any agency despite the fact that her behaviour was highly sexualised when she was she was raped over three days by a group of ten and yearold boys the violence only stopped when another girl saw what was happening and called the police during the first months of our twoyear investigation we have heard almost unbearable stories of children being violated we have spoken with children who have been abducted trafficked beaten and threatened after being drawn into a web of sexual violence with promises of love we have listened to accounts of children who have suffered in silence for years as they are casually and routinely raped by boys in their neighbourhood as they walk to the shops as they play in the park or as they head home after school the vast majority of perpetrators are male the victims are almost always girls our inquiry raises difficult and challenging questions above all we need to ask why so many males both young and old think it is acceptable to treat both girls and boys as objects to be used and abused we need to consider why professionals still miss the signs of abuse and also to consider the impact of pornography on children this is a not a problem within one particular faith or ethnic group our evidence shows the reality is much more troubling we found the perpetrators of abuse tended to mirror the makeup of the local population so where the population was mainly white the abusers were mainly white and where other ethnic groups lived the perpetrators were likewise there have been recent highprofile cases of pakistani men abusing white girls but focusing purely on this pattern of abuse is dangerous it has inevitably meant that both victims and abusers from other ethnicities have been overlooked those who perpetrate these crimes come from every community and every level in society this report is a wakeup call providing incontrovertible proof that the sexual exploitation and objectification of children must be urgently addressed it includes a list of the warning signs children show if they are being sexually abused all professionals who work with young people including the police health services youth offending teams and childrens social services must look out for these and where they suspect exploitation they have an absolute duty to share this information with each other and act on it but every one of us must also do more to protect children as one child said to me after telling her story i can let go now because you are

it was a simple yet powerful piece of evidence asked what lay behind the failures in rochdale over sexual exploitation of teenage girls sara rowbotham coordinator of the local nhs crisis intervention team paused before answering it was about attitudes towards teenagers she told the home affairs select committee earlier this month it was absolute disrespect that vulnerable young people did not have a voice they were overlooked they were discriminated against they were treated appallingly by protective services since nine men were jailed in may for sharing five girls plying them with fast food drink and drugs so they could use them for sex a picture has emerged of missed opportunities to help young girls being exploited based on a mistaken belief they were simply making their own choices the nhs team has emerged as one of the few services that got it right but staff numbers on the team which offers onetoone sexual health advice to vulnerable teenagers have been cut from to seven over the past three years a guardian investigation this year found the crisis intervention team made more than referrals about girls it thought were either being sexually exploited or at risk of it to rochdale borough council social services and greater manchester police between and the end of a report published in september by the local safeguarding children board scb was damning of the poor response of rochdales childrens social care department it also praised the crisis intervention teams ability to understand that girls were victims of abuse rather than consenting young adults its work rowbotham told the select committee had helped secure the recent convictions because the victims evidence was corroborated by the services case notes the team is mainly funded by the heywood middleton and rochdale primary care trust but the most recent staff member to go in march was funded by the pct rochdale council and the police and worked specifically on sexual exploitation she was seconded to the multiagency sunrise team which includes social workers police detectives family support workers and youth workers and had worked closely with the police bringing the recent prosecution the loss of the post leaves the sunrise team without a permanent member from the crisis intervention team which instead will make referrals into sunrise and provide services for young people sunrise refers to it the sunrise team is currently working with girls under when her explicit referrals werent acted upon rowbotham was asked whether she took further action i did absolutely she replied i told everybody these children were being abused the narrative on what went wrong in rochdale has shifted since the end of the trial in may speaking in the commons last week the labour mp simon danczuk said he believed it amounted to an attempted coverup by the labourrun council with the council leader colin lambert first suggesting it was a failure of informationsharing that had led to the problems soon after with evidence mounting that rochdale councils social services department had suggested these girls were making life choices and were prostitutes the council leader decided to change tack and started suggesting that the problems that occurred in rochdale should actually be laid at the feet of private care homes danczuk said the reality was that only one victim from the recent case had been in a childrens home he pointed out one private care home firm has threatened to sue lambert over comments he made many senior staff have left rochdale council in recent months in july cheryl eastwood director of childrens services since retired early steve garner who as head of targeted services was in charge of childrens social care stepped down a week after the scbs report came out to pursue new opportunities gone too is roger ellis chief executive for years until he took early retirement agreed in in april at the select committee he said he knew nothing about allegations of exploitation until he was told in that the men recently convicted had been arrested he said he hadnt known until then about either the existence of the sunrise team first planned in or the working group on child sexual exploitation set up in which that year identified young people affected by or at risk of exploitation he had simply not been told about these things he said i feel a deep sense of responsibility a sense of regret for what happened embarrassment at the failures that seem to have occurred ellis told the committee but he added that he didnt feel personal culpability the home affairs select committees chair keith vaz told ellis his evidence was deeply disappointing vaz is also writing to the nhs in rochdale about the crisis intervention team im shocked to know that a team that has provided so much very useful information that will enable the police to catch perpetrators has had its team cut vaz told the guardian i dont think thats proper and productive and i hope very much theyll think again about this meanwhile a review of the councils conduct around child sexual exploitation due to report in october has been delayed until january jim taylor the new chief executive at rochdale council says this is an independent review working to its own timescales determined by the reviewer who needs to make further enquiries,2012-11,wa simple yet powerful piece

dr andy tucker in the three previous years there have been a quarter to a third men a better turnout than on many gender programmes yet at the lse this year its not much better out of students on gender studies masters courses eight are men last year it was five out of students as dr jonathan dean a feminist political theory lecturer at leeds university says gender studies degrees and womens studies remain overwhelmingly femaledominated when i started in this field i thought i was the only man doing it why is there such a dearth of male students especially when there are so many male lecturers teaching gender studies after all its not womens studies any more apart from at oxford among others a change that has taken place over the past decade as gender courses in the uk have sprung up aiming at a wider audience both of women and men this imbalance comes as more men than ever among my friends at least seem involved or interested in gender debates at cambridge talks with a gender angle are always packed and nearly half with men whether its a female student philosopher arguing that patriarchy still oppresses women or a university keynote debate on differences between male and female brains the problem is not that men arent interested but for many a fear of feminism and its practitioners persists and thats what needs to change one man i spoke to an international relations phd student said i do not recognise gender studies as being a very important discipline i do think womens rights are important but i think in courses like these they are too critical of what they call maledominated reality another student said he would be put off a gender studies course interesting though it might be because the assumptions made about him particularly his sexuality would be too onerous and uncomfortable to explain if i studied gender studies i would seem gay i would have to justify myself all the time there would be so many really different assumptions about me i would have trouble finding a woman another student echoed simone de beauvoirs the second sex in when he said i wouldnt take gender studies because im a man and we arent different women are the ones who are considered different in reality men when present are greatly valued in gender studies courses not loathed as the living breathing patriarchy it seems to me that the women students are extraordinarily protective of the minority of men in the seminar group says anne phillips head of the lses gender institute in his feminist political theory class about a third male most of deans men seem to be on board or sympathetic to feminism but feminism isnt the only topic in gender studies just as important are masculinities and of course queer theory last year a male gender studies ma student called tom martin tried to sue the lse for offering an antiman course the claim was thrown out tucker at cambridge seems relaxed by this years noshow from men we want the best people and this year the best people who were able to take up places happened to be women in a few weeks were having a whole session on masculinities its important that those on the course engage with a range of theories which includes masculinities and this can be taught successfully whether or not there are men in the group perhaps but im more inclined to agree with the geography student who said to me at dinner recently at some point men have got to get involved or the whole thing will collapse have you ever studied gender were there any men on your course and do you wish there were more zoe strimpel is a journalist who started an mphil last month,2012-11,good job one start postgraduate degree gender study meet men mphil class cambridge contains precisely zero apparently anomalous according course director dr

today is international mens day yes i know you thought every day was international mens day imd but november is set aside as an opportunity to highlight genderspecific issues of male health and wellbeing the conversations that men whatever their positions of power and influence traditionally avoid within just a few years ive noticed reactions to imd follow an interesting trajectory from bafflement through indifference hostility and mockery to a grudging recognition and acceptance its a journey that probably feels familiar to many of the individual charities and campaigns involved a couple of weeks ago i was a guest at the second national conference for men and boys it was mostly an event for frontline workers and activists from the statutory and charitable sectors and as the only identified journalist in attendance several delegates spoke to me of their difficulties in getting their causes and issues taken seriously by local or national press despite that one senses a subtle change in mood as the media book publishers and even soap writers have finally realised that malespecific issues are occasionally worth a mention although it was billed as an event for the men and boys sector conference organiser glen poole used his own plenary session to spell out his dream of a global mens movement ill confess i winced when i first saw his title over the years the term mens movement has described an array of diverse trends ranging from mythopoets who gather in the woods to howl at the moon to those nodalong male feminist academics and activists who are less concerned with problems facing men than those caused by men more recently the phrase has been coopted by the angry antifeminists of the internet as a cover for untrammelled misogyny grievously mislabelled mens rights the vision laid out by poole was very different like the day itself it focused on specific social injustices that specifically or disproportionately affect men and boys mostly wellrecognised and uncontroversial all he did was join the dots he presented the issues as ultimately inseparable how do we pick apart male suicide from mental health then mental health from substance misuse and addiction how do we separate those from homelessness and physical health outcomes how can we talk about the crime and violence perpetrated by men and boys while ignoring the brutality inflicted upon men and boys how do we support boys through early life with good fathering when workplace rights and family courts are so often structured against it if it was really a jointhedots game it would sketch out a spiders web the mens sector as represented that day includes many brilliant organisations in isolation they have done great things but in coming together as a sector for international mens day or for a conference we may be seeing the seeds of a new unity a recognition that the problems they face are often the same one what is it some would call it antimale prejudice or misandry some call it socialisation some call it the workings of capitalism and some call it patriarchy personally i dont really care most of the time it all describes the same effects there may be feminists who find it threatening i believe that is misplaced as i argued on the day of the conference i believe a unified mens sector can not only peacefully coexist with the womens movement but actually complement it feminists want an end to male violence and criminality so do i feminists want equality in the home and the workplace so do i the old refrain patriarchy hurts men too is undoubtedly true but it is not a solution it implies that all we need to do is achieve full social justice for women and malespecific problems will simply wither away thats not only a bit daft in theory it is patently not working in practise mens issues must be considered alongside womens issues not least because our lives and welfare are intertwined perhaps the single most encouraging statement i heard at the conference was mark brooks of domestic violence charity the mankind initiative stressing that they only ever argue for male victims to be helped in addition to never instead of services offered to women to steal from petra to pay paul is not only morally abhorrent but deservedly an unwinnable argument are we seeing the seeds of a new mens movement the phrase seems grandiose but the word sector is not enough to begin to address and reverse these problems will need not only the intervention of specialist services but the engagement of the media politics and the public at large the first step in solving any problem is to identify and acknowledge its existence and international mens day is a very good place to start,2012-11,today international men day yes know

prosecutors recently indicted pennsylvania state universitys expresident graham spanier for allegedly covering up the sandusky child abuse scandal perhaps college administrators across america can now anticipate with relief fading public attention to sex crimes at colleges sandusky rots in prison and his associates are indicted nothing more to see here not so american universities public and private ivy league and mccollege have a rape problem college women have a chance pdf of experiencing attempted or completed sexual assault four times the average risk sexual violence also directly affects men as to of college men over million american men report experiencing rape where the american rape rate fell in years the college rate remains the same sociologists patricia martin and marlene powell termed the series of perverse responses that police medical legal personnel and even rape crisis centers offer survivors a second assault but american universities too exacerbate the problem their responses to rape are also a second assault survivors are starting a national conversation about this second assault and this conversation could not come at a better time recent and ongoing federal reviews of university sexual misconduct grievance procedures by the us department of educations office for civil rights include such prestigious schools as harvard yale and the university of virginia most survivors particularly college survivors do not report sexual assault administrators call nonreporting a problem but nonreporting reflects survivors wisdom in avoiding a second assault comprised of bad information nontransparency and deficient empathy universities maintain an informationpoor decision environment that minimizes institutional litigation risks specifically universities withhold three types of information from survivors first most universities do not inform survivors they can file civil complaints rather they strongly encourage police reporting and also offer an internal university reporting option neither of these options serves survivors best interests instead both set complainants up for failure and further trauma second universities deny survivors control over their own records in these investigations under the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa most universities disclose to complainant and defendant their investigation outcome and not the investigation record this nontransparency magnifies error and abuse potential it means complainants are unable to evaluate the facts that determine findings inhibiting complainants ability to contest these facts and take further informed actions such as filing civil suits it also creates an environment in which survivors experience loss of control all over again once over their bodies and then over their reporting choices and narratives more broadly typical university interpretation of ferpa effectively seals complaint records impairing administrators and survivors ability to connect paper trails thus university rape investigations also fail to protect society from repeat sexoffenders third universities deny otherwise available legal counsel to students involved in disputes with other students if you get arrested for drunkdriving most american universities offer you legal assistance not so if you get raped by another student as in the majority of college rape cases this policy reinforces survivors ignorance about civil complaints because criminal rape complaints usually fail civil complaints give survivors an otherwiseabsent fighting chance in court civil complaints must meet a preponderance of evidence form of burden of proof criminal complaints require stricter standard of proof because the stakes life and liberty are higher this beyond a reasonable doubt standard reduces the likelihood to a singledigit percentage chance that a rapist will be convicted and sentenced to prison so encouraging police reporting of sexual assault can have the perverse effect of demonstrating to survivors that police do not believe and thus will not protect them american universities internally investigating complaints of sexual violence misconduct and harassment apply a variety of standards of proof under pressure from the office for civil rights yale recently formalized the lower preponderance of evidence standard that is gradually becoming more common whats also common is a lack of transparency about what this preponderance standard means in practice the success rates of different types of complaints how administrators classify complaints and possible outcomes sometimes survivors may suggest appropriate possible remedies or sanctions but the criteria pdf for when university complaint processes offer that option are generally nontransparent uncertainty about possible outcomes contributes to the informationpoor environment in which complainants operate if university rape complaint judgments may seem meaningless given shifting standards of evidence and nontransparency about possible outcomes its because they are findings of sexual misconduct are the worst thing universities can determine as noncriminal courts in alleged rape cases yet such findings do not have welldefined consequences for instance they do not affect background checks this means that even if a university rape complaint investigation concludes that the alleged perpetrator did in fact violate a schools sexual misconduct policy that would not affect that individuals ability to obtain a teaching license internal sexual misconduct investigations are also traumatic for survivors because administrators fail to ensure survivor safety most university complaint hearings place the survivor and alleged assailant in the same room at the same time this practice generates legitimate wellbeing concerns for some complainants survivors who report may both rationally fear reprisal and experience traumatic stress in response to triggers such as the sound of an assailants voice this second assault by universities on rape survivors privileges institutional over student interests the motive for this protocol is purely material and reputational colleges correctly perceive they stand to lose millions of dollars and garner bad press as a result of rape complaints this calculation accounts for shortterm interests holding sway and institutional rather than community wellbeing being prioritised withholding information from survivors protects universities from lawsuits in the near term in franklin v gwinnett county public schools the us supreme court established that victims of sex discrimination including sexual abuse may be awarded compensatory and punitive monetary damages but in complaints of a sexual nature universities neuter title ix of the education amendments of the federal law forbidding sex discrimination in education by not informing complainants about the civil option as a matter of policy universities would also be vulnerable to class action lawsuits in cases of serial offenders if they did not effectively seal internal complaint records as recently recounted in the washington post psychologist david lisak conducted a study of collegeage men in which essentially selfreported committing an average of six rapes apiece disclosure of one college sexual misconduct complaint that could be linked to prior complaints would likely result in a multimilliondollar lawsuit against the college colleges prevent identification of such cases by interpreting ferpa in such a way as to render illegal formal disclosure of these patterns to complainants by disempowering survivors and refusing to police their students colleges magnify their peril in the long run civil liability extends from individual offenders to institutions themselves as survivors build better informal support networks and as anonymous digital communication makes it easier for them to share information with relatively low costs patterns of institutional misfeasance and malfeasance in response to sexual assault misconduct and harassment become easier to identify institutional civil liability is a ticking timebomb universities can take the following steps to improve their rape response decreasing that liability first provide survivors with enough information to make informed choices this means informing students of their complete reporting options criminal civil and university and providing enough legal counsel for survivors to understand the possible outcomes and likelihoods of those options more civil complaints against individual rapists will mean higher costs for pattern offenders lowering college rape rates second survivors deserve access to their own complaint records including the investigation record justifying the outcome survivors also have a right to expect their complaint records will be shared across offices for instance student services and police departments at their request and only at their request lowering the difficulty for survivors of reporting across offices increases the likelihood that police can investigate and identify prosecutable criminal cases again increasing penalties for offenders third universities need transparent policies that disclose what judgments produced by internal complaint investigations mean this entails formalizing the preponderance of evidence standard in complaints of a sexual nature and detailing how administrators apply that standard it also means publishing policies on the range of possible outcomes of internal investigations which should include letting complainants suggest possible remedies as they would in civil complaints fourth university administrators investigating complaints of a sexual nature must offer the complainant an opportunity to opt out of being present at the same time and place as the alleged offender fifth universities should be required to disclose relevant offender patterns of sexual assault misconduct and harassment to complainants this requirement would generate a structural incentive for schools to address the problem of repeat offenders before their behavior escalates but this reform will likely require a change in federal law correcting rampant university misinterpretations of ferpa as the rape prevention organization one in four notes rape is a global problem with comparable incidence rates in other places and institutions in many other countries treat survivors worse than do american institutions since martin and powell coined the term second assault in much has changed in american society but not at universities typical university rape responses privilege institutional over student interests in ways that empower predators and

for years women journalists knew their place at el vino banished to a back room away from the bar where they waited patiently for table service by way of defence el vino claimed that they were doing their female customers a favour by upholding oldfashioned ideas of chivalry any woman who dared to question the house rules risked being bawled at by the famously fierce bar manager and even barred all this changed in november when solicitor tess gill and journalist anna coote struck a blow for equality by winning their case against el vino in the court of appeal one of the judges lord justice griffiths said that el vinos popularity amongst journalists made it one of the famous gossip shops of fleet street and confining women reporters to the tables put them at a special disadvantage in picking up gossip of the day several days after the verdict el vino lifted the lifetime ban it had imposed on the two women by winning not only had the plaintiffs breached the male citadel of el vino they startled an industry dominated by newsmen the el vino case also proved that the sex discrimination act passed just a few years earlier in could be a potent weapon against inequality why the victory meant so much to the women says much about the importance el vino once had as a meeting place for exalted editors humble hacks and lawyers sometimes unruly it had its own charm and hosted many a legendary lunchtime session the ban on women standing at the bar was thought to date back to the second world war and was apparently instituted to prevent unescorted women of ill repute from picking up customers what is for sure is that the character of the place was imposed by the owner and prime vintner of fleet street frank bower who reputedly had quite puritanical views about women at the bar he also imposed a strict dress code of jacket collar and tie for men even in when the rest of the world was moving towards equality el vino stubbornly stuck to its rules that summer a group of female journalists marched through its front door and demanded to be served at the bar our money is equal so our rights must be equal said mavis davidson a reporter on the sun before they were sent back through the doors later some in fleet street mocked their protests as a storm in a sherry glass it was sheila gray a photographer on the morning star who sparked wider interest in the womens battle with el vino on the same day that the much publicised sex discrimination act came into force in december gray was refused at the bar with the backing of the equal opportunities commission she tried to sue el vino under the new act her lawyer arguing that the bar operated a petty apartheid westminster county court saw things differently and ruled against gray though her actions drew some sympathy not everyone rallied to the cause this letter from a female guardian reader accused the protestors of trivialising the hard work that went into getting the new law passed as the dispute entered a new decade el vino had fought off at least three legal challenges leading to doubts about the effectiveness of the sex discrimination act the only real hope for the women fell to tess gill and anna coote who had previously lost their case at mayors and city of london court despite this setback they took their case to the court of appeal and finally won in fleet street the womens victory was greeted by cheers even by men women who were once prevented from buying their own drinks whilst standing at the bar rushed to el vino to celebrate a hard fought win leading one exasperated bartender to exclaim

for decades the very means supposed to bring justice to survivors of sexual abuse whether police investigations public inquiries court cases or newspaper exposs have somehow had the habit of inverting justice confirming instead the views of some members of the public that survivors are fantasists liars disturbed and malicious child abuse exists of course it does except when it comes to finding the perpetrators and that ambivalence in society suits paedophiles very well indeed skilful sometimes powerful people who derive some of the pleasure in their repetitive obsessive sexual behaviour from showing their victims that they do what they will because they can it beggars belief that given the scale of child sexual abuse in according to the ministry of justice only people were convicted although police were notified of more than offences something needs to change jimmy saviles casual rapacious use of young vulnerable people meant he was called at one point the countrys most prolific

teenager struggling to give testimony of course tory peer lord mcalpine has suffered hugely his character has been cruelly and falsely besmirched a mans reputation is precious but so too is the need for hundreds of young people to see that justice is done again however they may be pushed aside in current inquiries its not so much that fresh evidence is required as that different questions should be posed we say its historical abuse but actually its alive says keith towler the very able welsh childrens commissioner this is not an archaeological dig were talking to people for whom this is

the child protection system should be overhauled to ensure vulnerable teenagers are taken seriously when they come forward to report allegations of sexual or physical abuse mps have said the commons education committee said events in rochdale where girls were sexually exploited by a group of older men and allegations about jimmy savile typified how safeguarding services too often failed to properly investigate reports made by teenagers it said the authorities were failing to listen to the victims of abuse and instead treating them as criminals or immigration cases the committees report says police schools and social workers are too often distracted by the sometimes disruptive behaviour of atrisk adolescents such as truanting or drugtaking and are illequipped to recognise the signs of abuse or understand the longterm impact on victims older children making allegations of abuse are often not believed and are dismissed by those in authority because of preconceptions about their own behaviour or about the standing of the alleged perpetrator it says the committees conservative chair graham stuart urged the government to review safeguarding for teenagers care for older children is not good enough they are let down too often frequently ignored or not listened to can be pushed out of care too young and insufficiently prepared and supported this has to change he said the report cites evidence from ofsted that apart from young babies children aged or over are the most vulnerable to abuse with a quarter of all serious case reviews between and involving adolescents teenagers often do not recognise they are being abused and those who do are often reluctant to disclose it because of shame embarrassment or mistrust of authorities the report says it says ministers have failed to allay fears over the treatment of trafficked or asylumseeking children childrens charities have legitimate concerns that government immigration policies are purposefully causing destitution among this group of children it would be outrageous if destitution were to be used as a weapon against children because of their immigration status the report says stuart said in all cases these children must be treated as children first and not just as either criminals or immigration cases to ensure this happens we want the department for education to take responsibility for the welfare of all children we also want the government to review the impact of immigration policy upon child protection the report says specialised forms of abuse such as forced marriage ritual abuse female genital mutilation socalled honour crimes and trafficking are too often seen primarily as problems of immigration or community integration rather than child abuse casting them as something other than child abuse can mean child victims are stigmatised or even criminalised and not afforded the protection that the system should offer them it says the committee said it recognised the concern of local authorities that cuts to youth services may jeopardise the route by which some young people may seek help the mps also raised concerns about the effect the governments health reforms on the nhss ability to safeguard younger patients there is a real and urgent fear among health professionals in child protection and their partners about the place and priority of child protection in the reformed

ordinary words struggle to convey the human consequences of child abuse and committeespeak is even less likely to do justice to its victims the home secretary headed for the commons to announce the seventh and eighth institutional inquiries launched since the jimmy savile paedophilia allegations came to light these concerned abuse in care homes in north wales and the possible inadequacy of an earlier report into this listening to the bickering about the scope powers and terms of reference it was hard to recall that the issue here was real individual men violating individual children for their own ends counterintuitive as it may be however this is a problem that can only be tackled by addressing institutions and culture after all witchhunts against individual paedophiles have been tried in the past the news of the worlds name and shame campaign came and went in causing chaos without preventing or even exposing the sort of abuse that is currently coming to light for the reality is that a great deal of the damage is and always has been done behind institutional walls eileen fairweather explains on our comment pages how in care homes these walls are built up out of deference to abusers and disbelief of their wards from boarding schools to the catholic church and now the bbc there are signs of the same story playing out the powerful closing ranks and the powerless keeping quiet or speaking out without being heard the institutional questions that demand a response range from the specific who on earth handed jimmy savile broadmoors keys to more diffuse concerns the weekend remarks by the retired head of the duncroft approved school for troubled girls in which she dismissed former pupils claims about savile as wild allegations by wellknown delinquents tell you everything you need to know about the culture of contempt towards vulnerable youngsters among certain professionals who were supposedly looking after them another problem is the traditional presumption rooted in two centuries of english common law that child witnesses could not be trusted this was overturned by statute in but perhaps it took longer for the culture of the courtroom to change the reported dismissal of abuse claims now back in the spotlight by sir ronald waterhouse the judge who led the original north wales inquiry as embarking on the realm of fantasy could become a totem of that traditional disbelief that however very much depends on the facts that get upturned facts that twittering accusers will not be patient for that is a pity truth will not be advanced nor

a new website dedicated to mediafriendly female experts has been launched in the wake of an embarrassing failure by the bbc to find a woman analyst to debate breast cancer treatment on radio john humphrys presenter of the today programme was reduced during an onair discussion last week to asking a male contributor to imagine that he was a woman because no female experts had been available caroline criadoperez a freelance journalist and blogger immediately took to twitter and found several female experts within minutes again and again the bbc doesnt try hard enough she said seemingly it doesnt think fair representation is particularly important this weekend criadoperez is overseeing the official launch of thewomensroomorguk she and her cofounder catherine smith hope the website will become a constantly expanding register of women who have personal experiences to relate and relevant expertise a trial run last week as women unite was an immediate success as more than women signed up in hours with expertise in standup comedy entrepreneurship new media personal finance domestic violence trade unions and feminism criadoperez and smith hope that female virtuosos of engineering motor racing science maths medicine and bridge building will eventually come forward or be nominated weve had a few critics saying why do the bbcs job for it says criadoperez and why do it unpaid but when a problem exists and nothing happens for years then its time to take the initiative its time to do it ourselves radio s womans hour has also begun a longterm project to give a higher profile to women in diverse areas of society last week it launched a search chaired by eve pollard a former national newspaper editor for britains most powerful women nominated by listeners the aim is to see how far women have come and the areas in which they still play no significant part we are hoping to hear from women weve never heard before pollard told womans hour host jenni murray in academia science research all sorts of areas that dont catch the eye of the media criadoperez who is doing a masters degree in gender also runs week woman a magazine for people interested in a world thats more than celebrities shoes and even socalled womens issues and she plans to establish a uk feminist party she points out that on the day before the breast cancer discussion the today programme had again brought two men together simon blake from brook offering sexual advice to unders and dr anthony seldon headmaster of wellington college a public school to discuss teenage girls and contraception i dont know if the bbc called a headmistress of an expensive girls boarding school but statistics suggest that she would have been less likely to say yes and less likely to consider herself an expert says criadoperez and that female reticence is something to be tackled women dont define themselves as experts and they dont put themselves forward but as someone who had been a teenage girl herself the headmistress would still have been preferable too often expert is defined as a white middleclass man that doesnt reflect the huge expertise and variety of experiences we have in society instead the media again and again draw on a small privileged group and the knockon effect is that all those other voices arent heard their needs arent reflected in public policy and citizenship is defined by a very narrow strata and is far from inclusive thats what makes me angry the bbc says it cant find female experts we say youre just not looking hard enough a spokeswoman for the bbc said we welcome the endeavour to help identify women experts today does accept like the rest of the bbc that we can do more however we are also at the mercy of the professions involved in stories for example the research into breast cancer screening was undertaken by male scientists criadoperez points out however that whether or not thewomensroomorguk takes off the bbc should in future break the habit of a lifetime and always ask a female cancer expert to comment,2012-11,new website dedicated mediafriendly female expert ha launched wake embarrassing failure bbc find woman analyst debate breast cancer

october was a devastating month for the bbc we learned that in jimmy savile the corporation inadvertently created and fostered the career of a prolific sexual abuser of children young people and women the bbc commissioned shows that provided savile with unusual access to potential victims and an unimpeachable celebrity aura it is true that the bbc was only one of many institutions where young victims were abused but these crimes have left physical and mental wounds that time rarely heals the accounts of many victims bear witness to the longterm tragic consequences of childhood sexual abuse many have gone on to suffer psychiatric illnesses and many need help but there is inadequate provision of such care so it is no wonder the realisation of the bbcs moral responsibility for savile weighs so heavily on george entwistle the director general of the bbc last week he was as bowed with horror as oedipus when he realised that the plague on his city arose from the secret stain on his lineage the uk has a painful and profound experience of the sexual abuse of girls and boys the very age of the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children founded in is a telling testament to the thousands of children who have suffered abuse in institutions as well as extended family networks where uncles stepfathers cousins parents and family friends predate it might cloud the picture we have built up of savile as a monster but it is quite possible that he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in childhood like saviles victims most sexually abused children do not tell anyone and this silence continues often throughout their lives or until their lives are interrupted by a tragedy that pinpoints the psychiatric illness that has spread like poison from the wounds of long ago the nspcc estimates that even now between and of all sexual abuse of children goes unreported and undetected wider recognition of the magnitude of our national affliction is long overdue but the public also needs to recognise that the silence and muffling of victims voices is pervasive in our society whether the perpetrator is a celebrity or not the savile scandal has illuminated again the plight of adult victims of childhood sexual abuse summed up by the former england rugby player brian moore the ongoing failure to help us is as much a scandal as the failures of years ago to catch our abusers if everyones starting point is our welfare and we all work outwards from there at least things will be going in the right direction we all have a responsibility to create a culture where no victim of abuse feels they wont be taken seriously it is distressing that a case should need to be made for devoting resources to stopping something as obviously abhorrent as child abuse nevertheless we must we still dont have the architecture of support necessary to deal with every report and to offer the necessary therapy to every person who needs it the case is therefore worth reiterating child abuse frequently underlies adult depression and other mental health problems it is linked to substance abuse and to criminal behaviour every increase in the proportion of abuse reported and investigated is a message to potential abusers that one day they will be caught and a potential deterrent to abusers this weeks revelation in the guardian concerning an emerging new charitable partnership between the bbc and the two charities most directly concerned the national association for people abused in childhood and the nspcc is very encouraging the voices of the adult victims are beginning to be heard it is to be hoped that other institutions affected will also contribute to the first full national provision of care for victims this initiative shows contrition and the acceptance of the right of jimmy saviles victims to restitution the legacy of this terrible national scandal must be to give the charities dealing with sexual abuse the publicity they deserve some of the funding they need and to immensely expand public understanding of the scale of this evil in our midst and of the damage it does,2012-11,october wa devastating month bbc learned jimmy savile

the bbc has released its annual faces of the year list a roll call of those according to the bbc whose fame is really something of the last months sweetie the panda was one of the women honored by the bbc in but thankfully there are no animals in the female category this time round the selections are boxer nicola adams marie colvin the war correspondent killed in a syrian rocket attack and malala yousafzai the yearold pakistani activist shot in the head by the taliban for colvin and yousafzai its the latest in a long list of accolades in yousafzai was runner up as time magazines person of the year and was named as one of foreign policy magazines top global thinkers colvins final dispatch from homs was widely read and she posthumously won more awards this year both inside and beyond the world of journalism than any other in her lifetime while its right that these two incredibly tenacious people are once again being honoured its a shame that brave women seem only to be celebrated once they have become victims there are many bold female reporters and human rights activists around the world who are ignored by the media and public until something goes wrong we prefer to romanticise victims rather than pay tribute to those who survive the most hostile environments unscathed and its the survivors the people who will go back to those environments again and again who need our support colvin was undoubtedly a fearless and talented journalist and our understanding of the world is poorer without her she was the doyenne of all war reporters as skys alex crawford described her when she was part of the judging panel that named colvin one of red magazines hot women of the year but colvin was a veteran a war correspondent for over years not just something of the last months like the bbc faces of the year list why is she only receiving such acclaim now would she have made the bbc list or been named a red magazine hot woman if someone hadnt taken the decision to attack her shelter in homs yousafzai has been an activist since does it take a taliban bullet to her head for people to listen to her there are many unsung heroes who have survived hostile environments on the same night as the red hot women awards i was at the rory peck awards which honour some of the most talented and brave freelance cameramen on the planet safa alahmad a saudi arabian filmmaker was a finalist for her work on frontline pbss al qaeda in yemen she had spent several months in a full burqa embedded with alqaida in the most dangerous part of one of the toughest countries in the world her film shone a light into a place television audiences had never seen but ahmad is unlikely to appear on any highprofile roll call of honour this year my colleague on channel s unreported world ramita navai has taken up some of the greatest challenges foreign reporting can offer shes been undercover both in zimbabwe and in syria where she was among the first to report from inside the conflict in october she was one of the few female journalists prepared to work in egypt reporting on the endemic sexual harassment there would navais films have a wider audience if she hadnt made it back in one piece when journalists and activists put themselves out on a limb to draw global attention to the darkest parts of the world its vital they get the recognition they deserve recognition translates into more opportunities to do their work for a wider audience better supported better funded women shouldnt have to become part of a tragic narrative in order to get that recognition but until we choose to celebrate survival more than we romanticise tragedy our most acclaimed heroines will be victims,2012-12,bbc ha released annual face year list roll call according bbc whose fame

following the horrific gangrape of a yearold student in delhi last sunday an indian police chief has provoked further fury by advising that women can avoid sexual assault by carrying chilli powder to throw at attackers and not going out after dark kp raghuvanshi joins the pantheon of men who have said said useless things about rape taking his lead from the west yorkshire police who in the s advised women not to go out alone at night in order to avoid being raped mutilated and murdered by the yorkshire ripper perhaps inevitably as a woman one can feel the pressure to avoid being raped weighs heavily only this morning i managed to avoid being violated three times on the way into work by walking along main roads and wearing a penguin onesie in order to disguise my tempting femaleness it transpires however that there are other strategies for preventing sexual assault that do not require the entire female population of any given town or country to stay indoors the magnificent feminist law professors blog suggested some a while back and their list written by ann bartow list bears a reread in these challenging times so kp raghuvanshi may i humbly suggest that you peruse the following sexual assault prevention tips they are guaranteed to work and involve no chilli powder or curfewed women whatsoever anne bartows sexual assault prevention tips dont put drugs in peoples drinks in order to control their behaviour when you see someone walking by themselves leave them alone if you pull over to help someone with car problems remember not to assault them never open an unlocked door or window uninvited if you are in an elevator and someone else gets in dont assault them remember people go to laundry to do their laundry do not attempt to molest someone who is alone in a laundry room use the buddy system if you are not able to stop yourself from assaulting people ask a friend to stay with you while you are in public always be honest with people dont pretend to be a caring friend in order to gain the trust of someone you want to assault consider telling them you plan to assault them if you dont communicate your intentions the other person may take that as a sign that you do not plan to rape them dont forget you cant have sex with someone unless they are awake carry a whistle if you are worried you might assault someone on accident you can hand it to the person you are with so they can blow it if you do,2012-12,following horrific gangrape yearold student delhi last sunday indian police chief ha provoked fury advising woman avoid sexual assault

when do we get to stop calling someone a good man or for that matter a good woman and how do we actually stop rape those are just two of the questions being raised by the internet argument du jour which started when the website the good men project put up a post by writer alyssa royse titled nice guys commit rape too the gist of royses piece is that one of her friends a nice guy she says raped a woman in their social circle the man admits that he penetrated the woman while she was sleeping but says he was confused by the mixed signals the woman sent him she apparently flirted aggressively and touched his hair and talked about her own sexuality which made him think that she wanted to have sex with him he waited until she was asleep and could not consent to put his penis inside of her in the piece royse contended that this nice guy is a rapist but an accidental one who was simply confused by societys mixedup views on sex and sexuality feminists including myself pushed back on royses narrative in response the good men project doubled down and then tripled and quadrupled down good men project editor joanna schroeder made the decision to publish under the cover of anonymity the firsthand account of an admitted and unrepentant rapist who enjoys his hardpartying lifestyle and says he has accepted a certain amount of rape as the cost of doing business then they put up several more posts justifying the decision to publish the royse piece and the rapists narrative when women and men who have dedicated their lives and careers to antirape work pointed out the fact that we have some pretty good scholarly sources that look at why men rape the good men project editors responded by attacking the scholarly sources some gmp writers quit the site in protest other gmp editors and writers joined forces with mens rights activists to lash out at feminists and antirape activists on twitter and other social media thankfully a few of the gmps contentsharing partners decided they no longer want to be affiliated with a site that supports the publication of anonymous unrepentant rapists and defends the actions of rapists as complex or unintentional so why am i writing about a relatively insular blog fight in my guardian column because it sheds light on just how toxic our culture is when it comes to rape and sexual assault and how we can fight back we actually know quite a bit about why men rape and especially about the kinds of rapes that the media often calls date rape or acquaintance rape rapes where the perpetrator knew the victim or at least ran in the same social circles academics researchers and sociologists have done indepth studies on sexual assault and found that its actually a small number of men who commit large numbers of acquaintance rapes most of those men intentionally target intoxicated women they socially isolate them ply them with alcohol to incapacitate them and intentionally push their boundaries to make them vulnerable these repeat rapists are more likely to have rigid views of gender roles and are more angry at women than the nonrapist men they perpetrate their crimes intentionally but use our social narratives about rape to avoid prosecution these are clearly not individuals who are simply in need of a little extra education about proper communication with the opposite sex says david lisak one of the researchers these are predators and yet we still image acquaintance rape as grey or murky two of the adjectives used by writers at the good men project theres a social view of rape as a he said she said situation especially when alcohol is involved two people get drunk the thinking goes and they make bad decisions or he didnt know she wasnt consenting or she regrets it in the morning and cries rape we pick apart all of the victims actions she was drinking too she was dancing provocatively she went home with him shes had sex before she has a sexy photo on facebook while were able to situate stranger rape clearly in the category of things done by predatory bad men acquaintance rape is often discussed as a sort of mistake made by a nice guy who just did the wrong thing that dynamic is on display yet again in steubenville ohio where members of the high school football team are accused of sexually assaulting a young woman at a party the woman was intoxicated and alternately passed out or was unable to stand up throughout the night the players allegedly penetrated her with their fingers laid her naked on the floor carried her limp body from party to party flashed her breasts and urged others to urinate on her photos were taken and shared with friends which launched a police investigation in response the town has rallied around the players and it appears the school has done very little the blogger who brought national attention to the case is being sued and blamed for creating local discord apparently its not the rape itself that rocked the boat but having the nerve to talk about it one of the volunteer football coaches yearold nate hubbard told the new york times that the rape was just an excuse i think because what else are you going to tell your parents when you come home drunk like that and after a night like that she had to make up something now people are trying to blow up our football program because of it the head coach reno saccoccia is no better he refused to suspend any of his players despite the serious allegations of groping and stripping an intoxicated young woman and taking and disseminating sexually explicit pictures of her because he said they didnt think they did anything wrong the police chief in charge of investigating the case complained of the national attention saying everybody wanted to incriminate more of the football players some because some of the other schools in the area are simply jealous of big red family members of the accused young men say that they didnt do anything wrong and were just in the wrong place at the wrong time attorneys for the young men are also quick to rely on the narratives that place blame on the alleged victim one of the attorneys adam nemann told the times that the girl was able to consent because she was able to remember her cellphone code after the alleged assault he also added that she had posted comments and photos on twitter and facebook which he says demonstrate she was sexually active and clearly engaged in atrisk behavior apparently you cant be raped unless youre a virgin the narratives on display in steubenville and at the good men project mean that rapists arent adequately prosecuted they allow us to think that real rapists jump out of the bushes while the men who rape many women they know are decent guys who are just confused and unfortunately its often women like the female writers and editors at the good men project who penned and published several of the articles at issue who do the coveringup for these men its a handy psychological defense mechanism to think that if you just dont do the wrong things if you dont get too drunk if you dont send mixed signals if you wear the right clothes youll be safe from assault unfortunately thats not true what is true researchers have found is that cultural opposition to rape myths makes men less likely to commit assault and acceptance of those myths makes sexual assault more likely in social groups where there is wide acceptance of rape myths for example the beliefs that acquaintance rape is a problem of communication or mixed signals that rapists simply cant control their sexual urges that women often lie about rape or that women invite rape upon themselves by their actions or manner of dressing rape proclivity is higher when men internalize rape myths they are more likely to commit rape or see rape as more acceptable when men perceive these rape myths as being widelyaccepted social norms their rape proclivity increases when men believe their peers are using coercion to get sex those men are more likely to engage in the same behaviors but when men see that rape myths were challenged or not accepted their rape proclivity decreases in other words challenging rape myths means less rape but when writers cultural figures mediamakers or individuals perpetuate the idea that rape is a grey area or that acquaintance rapists are nice guys who are just confused or that women somehow bring rape upon themselves that enables rapists and feeds their propensity to rape which is exactly why feminists get so angry when posts like the ones at the good men project are published or when people defend predatory men as nice guys actions have consequences and how we write and talk about these issues matters as wellmeaning as the authors and editors might be and as much as they insist they just want to have a conversation about rape when they inject grey rape and victimblaming into the narratives and when they publish unrepentant rapists who believe that their actions are common these publications are unwittingly or i would argue negligently and irresponsibly enabling rape its not just the good men project or the town of steubenville ohio those are simply the examples that came up today rape culture is so pervasive that if you ask me tomorrow ill be able to direct to you several others buying into social myths about rape is worldwide phenomenon every day conversations are had and articles are published that feed into these myths every day adherence to these myths gets rapists off the hook every day they groom more men to rape challenging these myths is an effective antirape strategy as groups like the wonderful men can stop rape know so we must challenge these myths we must support organizations and media outlets that challenge them and pull our support from the ones that dont we must challenge rape myths in our social circles and in our daytoday conversations and we must do so regularly and consistently almost everyone says they want to decrease the sexual assault rate feminists have been working for years to do just that and if crime statistics are any indication were succeeding so lets do what actually works it might not get you as many page views but thats about the only excuse left,2012-12,get stop calling someone good man matter good woman actually stop rape two question raised internet argument du jour started website good men project put post

lee eggleston was and still at school when she first heard about the rape crisis movement in the late s she had joined a cnd group in thurrock essex from which a group of women soon branched off including her and sheila coates a young mother of two at one meeting says coates all the women were talking about sexual violence and it was quite a shock wed all known each other for some time but no one was aware that everyone in the room had had something happen be it flashing or rape no one had told anybody soon afterwards they went on a group outing to a latenight showing at the local cinema wearing their cnd badges after the lights went down the harassment began the guys behind us started touching our hair stroking our backs says coates one straddled me and said he wanted to fuck me with a cruise missile says eggleston in the end this group of young guys was asked to leave says coates and we thought great when we leave theyll be outside we were trying to work out how we were all going to get home because these guys were so angry thankfully nothing happened but when the women met up again they started talking about how they would have been treated if it had in all likelihood they would have been asked why they were out in the middle of the night what they had done to aggravate the men what they were wearing eggleston says this group experience was crucial because it made them understand sexual violence as something more than simply an attack on the individual which could be solved with an individual response the thread of our lives is that this is a collective experience she says a rape crisis centre had been set up in london in and the thurrock group contacted it visited it and then decided to set up their own they spent three years training and organising before opening on march in a small room in a shared building all the staff were volunteers they had a phoneline for women in the area who had experienced sexual violence and although they advertised it for the first six weeks there were very few calls says coates we thought oh well no one wants to use us and then boosh we were inundated they were surprised how many calls were from women who had experienced sexual abuse as children these soon accounted for at least a third and they hadnt realised how many would want to speak face to face they counselled these women on the stairs in the garden in their cars women were contacting them from outside the local area and in the name of the service widened to become south essex rape and incest crisis centre sericc thats still its name today and i meet coates and eggleston at the unassuming building that houses it beautifully designed inside with some dedicated soundproofed counselling rooms the pair continue to run sericc and also rape crisis england and wales the umbrella organisation that links more than affiliated member centres coates is head of policy and strategy while eggleston is the chair its years since rape crisis began in the us moving quickly to the uk and the need for it is as pressing as ever in its first year sericc took or calls last year it took around as well as undertaking counselling sessions and advocacy hours the latter are necessary coates explains because when women contact us a lot of them have complex needs which can be around rent arrears eviction debt child protection issues children in care learning difficulties drug and alcohol problems complex longterm mental health issues all that has to be stabilised before you can engage in counselling they are currently working on a project that addresses the problems facing women with learning disabilities who are not getting any justice at all she says they report but it doesnt go to court because its assumed theyre not going to make a good witness in the national rape crisis helpline largely unfunded and staffed by volunteers took more than calls this year between april and september alone individual rape crisis centres and the national helpline combined have taken calls that was before the jimmy savile story broke the itv documentary about his crimes exposure was shown on october and afterwards calls to rape crisis spiked by that wasnt a shock they see a rush of calls whenever sexual violence is mentioned in the media but what makes the last few months especially significant says eggleston is that you can turn on the tv and sexual violence is the top three stories on the news i dont think thats ever happened in our year history the effect on those who have been abused is obvious in the police figures reported last week a fourfold increase in reports to the metropolitan polices child abuse investigation teams a increase in reports to operation sapphire the mets specialist rape investigation team compared with this period last year often adult women dont report to the police or speak to anyone about their experience until theres a trigger in their life says eggleston it could be the birth of a grandchild or their own child it could be that their child reaches the age they were when it happened or they might have knowledge of the offender being around children sometimes its exactly what has happened with savile where theres the death of the offender and women feel free to speak rape crisis centres have always provided womenonly space not necessarily dedicated space says eggleston but at certain times of day women tell them this is important that it is easier for them to call in the knowledge that another woman will answer but threequarters of the centres in england and wales work with men and boys too both survivors of sexual violence and those supporting women survivors and all are happy to refer people of any gender to specialist services that can help over the years sericc has had to shift the age of those they work with downwards from to four and were saying we cant work with anyone younger says coates we have had referrals of a mother with a threemonthold baby and a yearold baby and we can work with the mother but we dont know how to work with the child you cant at the other end of the age range they have worked with women in their s and s up to older women are reporting rape by care workers health professionals says coates its often quite recent sexual assault when the centres started opening in the s they took calls from women who had been raped during the second world war who had never spoken about it before kate cook coauthor of rape crisis responding to sexual violence who has volunteered on the phoneline extensively over the years says some of the most difficult calls are the ones where someone is saying the least theyre so upset hurting so much that its very hard for them to speak helen jones cooks coauthor volunteered at a centre in merseyside during the mids and says one of the most affecting calls she ever took was just a few minutes long one sunday afternoon this voice said hello dear i dont know whether ive phoned the right number or not so i said well this is rape crisis and its for people who have been sexually abused at any point in their lives she said yes dear thatll be right well you know when i was little when i was my father did something he shouldnt and he raped me she was quite forthright about it she said he raped me and ive never told anybody and im years old now and i just wanted to tell somebody before i died and so i said to her well im ever so glad that you phoned me and that im the person who you shared that with and so she said yes so am i thank you dear goodbye rape crisis gives women the chance to speak about what happened to them without judgment without pressure to report to the police and with a guarantee that they will be believed the movement started with women speaking about their experiences in consciousnessraising groups in the early s including one attended by noreen connell who was then a member of new york radical feminists women remembered being raped or fondled when they were children and their parents had made light of it she says the women didnt see themselves as victims so much as angry citizens they felt they had been treated worse than the rapist and grilled for the delight of police officers and this seemed to be a common experience rape became the subject of the first ever feminist speakout at st clements a small church in manhattan in january women stood before an audience of and talked about their experiences some of the stories are collected in rape the first sourcebook for women which connell coedited they include a woman who was gang raped by three men then chided by the police for being too coherent too calm when she reported her demeanour meant they didnt readily believe her there was a woman raped by her husband a woman whose teenage brother assaulted her and whose mother simply responded that the same thing had happened to her as a child but worse and she had learned to lock her bedroom door if her brother was home a woman raped by an intruder who was asked by the police precisely how long the mans penis was and told by the doctor she couldnt possibly have been raped as her vagina wasnt ripped the last policeman this woman saw during the rape investigation asked her for a date the writer susan brownmiller helped organise the speakout and says she found it astonishing she went on to speak at the new york radical feminist conference on rape in april and then to write the groundbreaking book against our will when it was published in the mids it was reviewed in the sunday times she says and the reviewer said this is a book by an american journalist about an american crime this outlook was echoed by other british critics one of the first rape crisis centres opened in washington dc in july liz osullivan was involved in setting it up and says they were surprised by the stories of incest domestic violence and marital rape when you look at movements she says they permeate the whole society so they change the dialogue the conversations that arose through rape crisis allowed for the broadening of definitions of sexual assault and rape to recognise the gamut of offences and how they affected different groups in for instance as recorded in maria bevacquas book rape on the public agenda the washington dc rape crisis centre hosted the first national conference on third world women and violence the centre also worked with men who were incarcerated locally who had formed a group called prisoners against rape in the years since the movement started rape in marriage has been recognised in law in the uk and oral and anal penetration have been included in the definition of rape the latter as a result of strong successful lobbying from gay rights groups but the chances of victims being believed getting proper support and securing justice remain low according to the home office more than women in england and wales are sexually assaulted and raped each year yet a report by baroness stern in estimated only of rapes came to the attention of the police of those rapes that are reported a very small proportion usually quoted at around end in a conviction on that charge this is largely due to cases failing to get as far as court of those that do reach court end in a conviction of rape serious sexual assault or a violent crime and in a conviction of rape but the process is so lengthy and so bruising that many of those who report drop out and others have their case dropped by the authorities jan mcleod started volunteering at rape crisis glasgow in the late s when she was still a student and is now on rape crisis scotlands board of directors she says that back then the police often aggressively questioned women who reported rape and would justify this by saying we have to be tough because theyll get asked worse in court there was some truth in this she remembers circulating a petition regarding the situation of a young woman who had been raped it must have been by more than one man inside a motor vehicle the jury made her reenact it because the defence was saying it would be impossible for one person to rape another in this confined space so they actually in the trial made her get into the back of the same car and lie in the position in roger graefs bbc documentary a complaint of rape caused a furore regarding the treatment of rape complainants the flyonthewall programme showed a woman reporting a rape by two men to which police responded with aggression and incredulity this is the biggest lot of bollocks ive ever heard said one the woman was accused of being a willing party of not being upset enough was asked if she had ever been on the game and how many sexual partners shed had in its wake it was no surprise to eggleston and coates in that most women didnt want to report when they supported those who complained the police could be quite antagonistic says coates but that began to change these days they often work closely with the police and have had good experiences but i think its still a bit luck of the draw says coates there are some officers who are fantastic others who are not that was demonstrated in recent cases involving the metropolitan polices sapphire unit supposedly the gold standard of rape investigation in september detective constable ryan colemanfarrow pleaded guilty to counts of misconduct after failing to investigate rape cases and three sexual assaults they included a yearold woman allegedly raped by her son last week in a separate case the met paid out to a woman who reported rape in when she was after it was claimed a sapphire officer had failed to investigate properly still if women didnt feel confident reporting to the police says eggleston the numbers would be even lower at that stage what can be more problematic is the journey to court which can easily take two years and were saying unless that changes the attrition rate will never change sericc supported a yearold girl last year who reported her case to the police in september it wasnt until christmas day itself that they finally interviewed her four years ago rape crisis england and wales faced a crisis of its own affiliated centres had closed since down from to in all of those left did not have sustainable funding to the surprise of eggleston and coates that picture changed when the coalition government came to power both the conservatives and liberal democrats promised up to new rape crisis centres before the last general election and by the end of january they will have delivered that figure does not include the three new centres that have opened in london and threeyear funding has also been set up to make all the existing centres sustainable in those terms the picture is improved but the national organisation rape crisis england and wales is seriously underfunded as is the national helpline which runs on a voluntary basis there is no money for the very basics you would expect such as the ability to expand the hours the phonelines stay open reduce the waiting lists for counselling sessions and reduce the postcode lottery for services wales for example has only one affiliated centre there is certainly no funding for the campaigns they would love to run which could target public attitudes in an amnesty international poll found of people thought a woman was partially or totally responsible for being raped if she was wearing revealing clothing held the same view if a woman had had many sexual partners in a survey by haven a service for people who have been raped found a third of women polled thought a victim bore some responsibility if they had gone to their attackers house for a drink when they try to raise money the donations are generally minimal they suspect this might be partly because people assume the organisation is fully funded already but the issue seems to go deeper the organisers of some of the countrys major telethons have told them donations plummet when they run segments on violence against women they need more people to volunteer and not just for the helplines but accountants solicitors journalists and other professionals who could support management teams they are trying to train women so they understand the history of the movement so the torch can be passed to staff who continue its ethos i wonder if the work ever upsets them eggleston says every woman who comes in is a survivor theyve got to the door and that fills us with hope sometimes says mcleod you can see the change in a woman who comes to speak to you just instantaneously where she thinks its not just me there are other people in the world who know what im talking about back in the early s when rape and certainly child sexual abuse was barely ever spoken about the birth of the rape crisis movement felt as if the world had cracked open says connell now institutions such as the catholic church are being revealed theres the bbc scandal and in the united states there was penn state a college where they tolerated a pederast football coach and an assistant coach actually saw him raping a child savile has been accused of rapes seven men have been questioned as part of the ongoing investigation operation yewtree and there is a stream of allegations regarding the late mp cyril smith could this be a watershed moment i hope so says coates she has tried in the past to raise the subject of adults who were sexually assaulted as children and no ones ever wanted to listen now they are but whether that is sustained or not i dont know it will be interesting to look back in a year months and ask has anything actually changed the rape crisis national helpline is open daily pm and pm call,2012-12,lee eggleston wa still school first heard rape crisis movement late joined cnd group thurrock essex

hi i am a student peer health adviser who has been trained to work with victims of sexual assault i am here to listen to your story as your advocate and let you know that you are not alone you can trust me just one small technicality to note before we get started if asked in court i will have to repeat every word of this conversation your parents your professors your siblings your teammates your future employer your roommate your rapist will know what you say here i hope we have a good talk this introduction is probably not exactly how sexual assault consultations go down at princeton university but add the odd im so sorry and this must be so hard for you and youve got a fairly accurate transcript of the typical conversation at the majority of us universities when a student goes to see a peer sexual assault counsellor shell get sympathy shell get respect but shell also get a clear message nothing that we say here today is guaranteed to be confidential by now a lot of universities have some kind of peertopeer sexual assault counselling programme and so they should peer counselling programmes offer the comfort of shared experience counsellors who understand the social pressures of student life at the university but while well intentioned the vast majority of these programmes are not supported well enough to become what they need to be confidential sources of advice and encouragement without a certain level of training an advocate does not have whats called legal privilege he or she can be forced to relay all information in a courtroom in order to guarantee confidentiality at the beginning of a discussion a peer health adviser needs to have undergone extensive training by a federally recognised organisation i am a member of the sexual assault response team at womanspace a sexual assault and domestic violence nonprofit organisation in new jersey last semester i completed hours of training when it was over i understood the steps for getting a restraining order the specific effects of all kinds of drugs and alcohol and the myriad of emotions someone might be feeling in the weeks after an assault that training gave me legal privilege unless a victim talks about harming herself harming others or reports child abuse everything we discuss stays between us at princeton university where i am a junior victims of sexual assault are encouraged to seek support from a share sexual harassmentassault advising resources and education peer adviser these undergraduate advocates complete hours of training annually they know what options are available to students and they give excellent referrals but thats it the share peer advisers involvement ends there so why is this a big deal after all princeton along with most universities in the us employs professional counsellors to talk to student victims of sexual assault these professional counsellors have privilege so everything said to them stays confidential the problem is this college women are prone to wonder whether their experience with sexual assault was real or warranted theyll ask questions like was my skirt too short did i drink too much was i asking for it chances are they wont want to ask these questions to an adult theyll want to talk to their friends or at least someone their own age without collegesanctioned programmes that fulfill the requirements for legal privilege these peer advocates cannot promise confidentiality and without that promise victims are much less likely to want to share those most vulnerable moments they end up feeling alone ashamed and guilty but students should not have to choose between empathy knowing that their counsellor understands and can sympathise with the context in which their assault took place and confidentiality at rutgers university sexual assault response teams offer both members from all branches of the university community faculty administrators and most importantly students participate in hours of stateapproved training that stateapproved training gives these advisers legal privilege and the power to promise your story will remain confidential as an advocate confidentiality is the most important thing that you can offer to a survivor said laura luciano assistant director of violence prevention and victim assistance at rutgers there are so many dangerous legal ramifications when a victim talks to someone without privilege heres whats scary rutgers is one of the only programmes of its kind in the us most schools have no peer resources at all for victims of sexual assault and the vast majority of the schools that do dont offer programmes that are statecertified to train rape crisis counsellors to become statecertified programmes need to require a certain number of training hours this varies from state to state and use a governmentapproved curriculum to cut a long story short programmes like the one at rutgers require more university staff and more university money for most people who have experienced it a sexual assault is the most vulnerable moment of their lives when they are feeling that thoroughly shaken they are going to be scared to talk people might judge or criticise or worst of all might not believe them thats why universities need to give victims easy access to the people that they will be most likely to trust trained peers who can promise confidentiality,2012-12,hi student peer health adviser ha trained work victim sexual assault listen story advocate let know alone trust one small technicality note get started asked court repeat every word conversation parent professor sibling teammate future employer roommate rapist know say hope good talk introduction probably exactly sexual assault consultation go princeton university add odd im

rapists and sex attackers should be given longer prison terms the sentencing council recommends as courts take into account gang attacks and new technologies exploited by offenders the filming of rapes combined with threats to release humiliating images and internet grooming of young children are both becoming more widespread according to the councils report released on monday the impact on the victim including physical and emotional harm must be central to any judges determination of the level of sentence the page consultation on guidelines for sexual offences says length of prison terms given for such offences have been rising and the updated guidelines reflect a tougher approach to sex crimes under existing guidelines for example repeated rape of the same victim over a course of time or rape involving multiple victims attract the highest guideline sentencing levels years but the new guidelines suggest that level of sentence should also be available for a single rape other guidelines are recommended to rise similarly within the legal limits set out by the sexual offences act the existing guidelines for sexual assault the council says take too narrow an approach and focus too much on the nature of the physical activity done by the offender launching the document lord justice treacy who is a member of the sentencing council said were improving guidance for courts to help them deal with these incredibly complex sensitive and serious offences the perspective of victims is central to the councils considerations we want to ensure sentences reflect everything the victim has been through and what the offender has done we are looking at the whole context not just the physical offence but also the tactics employed by offenders like grooming activity the targeting of vulnerable victims or abuse of a position of trust no one wants more people becoming victims so protecting the public is a vital part of our proposals whether this is by jailing offenders or through rigorous treatment to stop them reoffending judges are asked to take into account factors such as stalking and previous abuse by offenders and the targeting of vulnerable victims such as those in care the council said the guideline review has come about because the nature of offending has changed there is a greater understanding of how perpetrators use technology in offences involving indecent images of children and in cases of sexual exploitation and child grooming the guidelines reflect these developments so they cover the ways these crimes are committed today the council said the consultation quotes comments during a sentencing last year by the lord chief justice lord judge who said a pernicious new habit has developed by which criminals take photographs of their victims often just to show off to their friends often just to add to the humiliation which their victim is already suffering and sometimes either as a form of pressure to discourage any complaint but also possibly for the purposes of blackmail we make it clear that from now onwards the taking of photographs should always be treated as an aggravating feature of any case and in particular of any sexual cases those who target vulnerable victims such as people who have experienced habitual sexual abuse previously which makes them especially prone to be victimised will also be treated more harshly on indecent images of children the council proposes recognising new aggravating factors related to involvement in paedophile networks or abuse of a position of trust to create images or videos a total of

the police have to mix things up a bit with their christmas campaigns you cant tell people not to drink and drive every year one day well all wake up thinking stay sober just to drive but thats so so this year the met is going with two messages one about theft and one called my decision for the victims of rape you think a campaign about rape called my decision should have been directed at rapists the people whose decision it might be yes me too but thats not really what the campaigns about rather it walks victims through the aftermath whether they go immediately to the police first to a haven or just to a doctor this came about through conversations between the met and concerned charities about what stopped people reporting that they had been raped these highlighted a number of barriers such as victims feeling they will not be believed being confused about where to go for help and feeling that they would lose control of the process once in the hands of the police the mets specialist crime directorate in cases of sexual abuse is called sapphire this was the unit responsible for the myriad failings that left serial rapists john worboys and kirk reid free to attack women for years reid who raped or sexually assaulted at least women is one of the most prolific rapists in britains history the unit called it their mcpherson moment and promised profound changes to the way in which sapphire was run this year an unnamed officer involved in rape cases was arrested on charges of perverting the course of justice his colleague ryan colemanfarrow was charged with counts of misconduct in a public office including falsifying statements and reports in short if women think that by going to the police they will cede control to a kafkaesque system in which realities shift and transparency is a joke they are dead right if women think they will not be believed it is actually slightly worse than that if they get the wrong officer they wont be believed and then their statements may be altered to make sure no one else believes them either this website has been set up to address a breakdown of trust between two specific groups victims of rape and sapphire officers yet where on the floating infographics is the frequently asked question what do i do when the policeman in charge of my case is arrested for misconduct in a public office nowhere like almost all public information campaigns about rape this is all about the victim the perpetrator whether thats the rapist or the person who destroyed peoples faith in policing is so invisible so faceless that he is not so much a man as an act of god you would no more address him than you would address a tsunami and ask it to spare the major towns ann bartow of the pace law school in westchester us parodied this peerlessly with her sexual assault prevention tips guaranteed to work of which my favourite though do read them all is always be honest with people dont pretend to be a caring friend in order to gain the trust of someone you want to assault consider telling them you plan to assault them if you dont communicate your intentions the other person may take that as a sign that you do not plan to rape them in real life tips for women on how to avoid being raped range from this neutralsounding but actually quite bizarre nugget on the sapphire website appoint a nominated drinkswatcher someone stays sober all night just watching drinks how is that fun what if there are only two of you to campaigns that blame women outright for what happens to them if theyre drunk the strapline on an advertisement from the pennsylvania liquor control board reads she didnt want to do it but she couldnt say no i suppose the argument runs that anybody can be raped whereas rapists are at the extreme end of the human spectrum that is debatable in itself what the rapist profile is and how ubiquitous but nevertheless you can make the case with a public infomercial that you should aim it at the widest possible pool which must be that of victims however the message is false there is no such thing as perfect invulnerability from sexual attack or at least there is no way you could make yourself invulnerable without that interfering with your freedom and selfdetermination this acronym of the mets prepare look confident avoid risks never take safety for granted plan doesnt leave you inviolable at all all it does is maybe make you less likely to be raped than someone who didnt plan and will be raped instead theres nothing in this advice to reduce the incidence of rape theres just a steady attempt to normalise hypercaution so that we can tacitly work towards the situation in which victims arent normal theyre vulnerable or chaotic even before theyre raped they exist in a state of prerape thats the culture that makes victims afraid to go to the police even if they dont think the police will fail them then the police so often do fail them then the police produce a website telling victims not to be afraid of police failure without mentioning how often they have failed the met has some brass festive neck ill give them that twitter zoesqwilliams,2012-12,police mix thing bit

a littlediscussed development in the recent resurgence of feminist activism is the increasing presence of men in spaces that had been designated womenonly when i became active in the s groups like uk feminista and go feminist believe it is important to include men in their events because they need to be part of the solution while some spaces should still be women only i agree its time that men are allowed into our conferences so that they learn something if only they listen for long enough to hear what is being said often men still continue to dominate debates in feminist gatherings even though this was one of the original reasons for us organising autonomously its great that men are becoming sensitive to the power they exercise over women and hold it in check we should celebrate them showing their solidarity to women fending off sexual assault and violence even if you would have thought that any demonstration of male solidarity would be surprising enough not to require further gimmicks but during the days of activism against gender violence campaign which is taking place between november and december this year men in toronto came up with a new tactic walk a mile in her shoes in which men walk a mile in womens stilettos this has morphed into these heels are made for walking in britain awarenessraising marches held in hebden bridge by the white ribbon campaign and by local councils in peterborough and bromsgrove amp redditch i asked the uk organisers why they had chosen high heels wasnt there a danger of perpetuating the stereotype of giddyheaded women addicted to the kind of fashion items that make them more vulnerable bev houghton of redditch was at pains to point out that there was no compulsion for men to wear heels they could walk in flipflops bedroom slippers or trainers the photos do indeed reveal a variety of footwear in any case the local shoe shop that donated high heels for the event could not supply more than pairs of womens shoes in sizes large enough which restricted the number of men participating and there i was wondering what had happened to their commitment it seemed to be mostly women who were involved in organising these events cant men get up and do this for themselves again houghton thought this was purely coincidental she proudly announced that they had both male and female domestic violence workers who worked with both genders did she mean that men worked with women victims of violence yes she confirmed we are very gender neutral here she rushed to add that of course they dont see both the men and women together phew they still recognise the importance of safe spaces for women but gender neutrality is spreading like a virus through state services and weakening the fight to tackle violence against women pragna patel of southall black sisters which took ealing council to a judicial review to establish the importance of specialist services such as theirs believes that this is a serious serious problem when the state latches on to these issues it depoliticises and corporatises them this raises the wider question of whether local councils should become involved in campaigning at one level it might be desirable that they have an understanding of gender politics but time and again they leach it of its radical edge this is not to deny that a minority of men suffer violence and will need services but to assert that it mainly affects women how else can we explain that the days devoted to women becomes gender neutral when local councils get their hands on them for this reason i much prefer the politics of the bromsgrove and redditch campaign these hands are not for hurting this refocuses our attention on the origins of violence rather than appearing to mock those whose shoes we are meant to be filling this article was amended on december it originally listed london feminist network alongside uk feminista and go feminist as a group that includes men in its events in fact the only large

the opening night of the london feminist film festival last friday seemed like a huge success myriam fougres lesbiana a parallel revolution about lesbian separatist communities in north america in the s was originally going to be screened at one of the smaller screens at the hackney picturehouse but was moved to the biggest one after it sold out and then sold out again unfortunately the film didnt end up in the centre of the event chair femi otitoju managed to introduce the panellists director fougre politician and activist linda bellos and antiporn activist and academic julia long but even before the floor was opened for questions long raised her hand and asked all the men in the audience to leave there was an instant uproar lots of clapping but also lots of booing many men and women got up and left visibly disgruntled long then elaborated on her point saying how politically disastrous it had been to allow men to attend feminist events and conferences in recent years although she did not specify what the harm actually was she made some further controversial claims such as that heterosexuality can be a death sentence no thats conflating it with abuse or that in the face of off the scale sexual violence and misogyny theres nothing more threatening than women withdrawing from men completely how very progressive and changeinspiring meanwhile most questions from the audience rather than referring to the film opposed longs request some men were here to learn and its not a simple binary not all of us are men or women said one audience member you have to know your allies said another changing the dynamic of what is a public screening was not fair your invitation was not in my name some voices managed to come through about the actual film people asked how women managed to fund their communities which inspired fougre to share some incredible stories about building houses simply from surrounding trees or about how some women were split between still working out in the world but coming back to the communes as their homes she made a comment that could have inspired a huge and fascinating discussion you did it for a year or two but you cant be an activist and separatist forever you move back to your functioning toilet at home an audience member talked about the history of the lesbian line and another underlined the importance of archiving and oral history fougre replied saying she will leave all the material she used for the movie interviews in a new york library and thats what the whole discussion should have been about yes lesbiana is a film about s lesbian separatism and the film examines the relief that not having to deal with men at all has brought to the women involved like any other perspective its worth hearing out its also worth debating but in context what was said in completely different circumstances years ago cannot by default apply to the here and now especially if the open film screening wasnt advertised as a womenonly event its not even about the fact that people paid to attend its about outreach inclusivity and intersectionality i agree with bellos when she says womenonly spaces are important i agree with her when she says women cant hold men by the hand that theres work to be done by men to redefine masculinity i agree that its not obvious what role feminist men can assume within the movement without derailing it and taking power away from women however patriarchy hurts men too something that does not erase the damage it does to women but underlines how important it is to reject bankrupt binaries when they are damaging the london feminist film festival has since apologised to anyone who was offended saying they were not aware that the panellist would make this comment and while respecting the politics of the panellist do not condone her comment all are welcome at all lfff sessions in my view what long suggested completely derailed the nights debate not only was it offensive to assume the authority to change the dynamics of the space but also deeply unfortunate to take the time and attention away from the artist and her film and all the people involved they deserved better,2012-12,opening night

carla brunisarkozy is under fire for declaring to a magazine that she has no use for feminism we dont need to be feminists in my generation she told french vogue so not just her but her entire generation thats quite a few who dont need feminism later after much uproar and a twitter campaign detailing why feminism might still be necessary bs clarified her remarks by saying that pioneers had already done the work she added i am a feminist if being a feminist is demanding freedom well yeees but only in the context of feminism as a vague multipurpose rock lyric im free woowoo love that if too hinting that for carla any other definition would be a dealbreaker if we wanted to be nasty we could just call bs a spoilt blinkered moo who clearly doesnt know her la perlaclad derriere from her chaneladorned elbow more charitably it could be that she appears to have conflated her own gilded life model singer wife of a former french president with that of everywoman shes so dazzled by her ivory tower that she cannot see beyond to the real world where not everyone is married to a former head of state with all attendant socioeconomic privileges in short carla has exposed herself as being what i would term a bespoke feminist which is someone for whom feminism has no true core no root or ideology certainly nothing as tedious as facts or stats these types seek to customise feminism to fit in with their own life experiences and worldview ergo if theyre not suffering discrimination and stuff poverty lack of autonomy insufficient childcare lower pay exemption from boardrooms government and other maledominated echelons not to mention domestic violence sexual assault and murder then it isnt happening to any other woman either well how could it be when its not happening to them this is where the likes of carla spend their days in a fluffy moneyed space suspended somewhere between myopia and solipsism carla doesnt subscribe to feminism rather carlaism or its all about meism but then cant we all get a bit bespoke at times im a practising barbaraist how do you do its only human to be drawn to some issues over others even to succumb to the odd empathy disconnect the single mother drowning in childcare costs may find it difficult to sympathise with the hotshot businesswoman being denied her rightful promotion and vice versa in a way all feminists are bespoke feminists just as they are bespoke humans however what irks about ms brunisarkozy is that she is all bespoke and no feminist not to mention obstinately delighted by her cosseted worldview where womens issues are concerned she comes across like a onewoman three unwise monkeys see no evil hear no evil speak a lot of illinformed claptrap is la brunisarkozy even aware that france has never had a female president likewise while it was sweet of her to give a curt nod to those pioneers it would have been even better not to discredit feminism as no longer necessary merci beaucoup how does this cast other women still fighting as outmoded hysterics and manhaters women so dumb they didnt even have the good sense to marry a world leader like carla did this kind of attitude goes beyond any concept of bespoke feminism it makes such women resemble overindulged idiots with no interest in or empathy with others it also emphasises that the real threat to feminism is not to end up as a dirty word but as a forgotten word thrown out by the likes of carla with other dated fads popping candy the hula hoop female suffrage come to think of it perhaps its fine that brunisarkozy doesnt feel she needs feminism feminism is going to do fine without her oh no ono leave britains blokes alone who else is thrilled by yoko onos range of menswear theres something for everyone just in time for christmas man bras with lights on jockstraps that resemble sampm origami trousers with black hands over the crotch and the arse panel couture term cutout and a musthave for the guy about town nipple bells leastways i think the collection is for men it could be for drugraddled smurfs and i say that in a fashiontastic way ono reveals that she first drew the designs in for john lennon as a wedding present hmm revealing at first glance this collection appears to be aimed at the avantgarde gay market but i smell hetero in her conceptual artistic way yoko was only doing what women have done since time immemorial restyling her man another woman might have chosen a nice hampm jumper that brings out his eyes ono goes for an anorak with a bum painted on it different route same ultimate goal which is lady control over what your man wears yeah sister all of which explains why lennon was so happy to get naked for the bedin now weve seen the alternatives it was the vanilla option butling certainly doesnt ring my bell even if i were famous or in any way interesting i could never go on who do you think you are it would depress everybody my family wasnt doing that well when i was born so it wouldnt be five minutes before wed be getting on to workhouses infant mortality and sexual molestation by the local squire for people like me fetishising the past isnt an option we know wed have been in the scullery blacking the hearth and sleeping on hay however other people have big ideas about themselves downton abbey has sparked a surge of interest in the services of butlers some of whom can earn a year they are hired by people keen to show off their wealth and replicate a bygone age how pathetic not the butlers mind if some nouveau riche goon is willing to pay k for a shoddy impersonation of john gielgud fill your boots its the employers pompously ringing their butler bells what kind of deep selfloathing would have to set in before having a butler is the only way you could feel good about yourself there must be a limit to how bullied anyone could have been at school poor lost fools however at least they can afford to live out their strange fantasies of barely disguised western slave culture what about those who could never have a butler but yearn for one anyway people who watch downton and relate to those upstairs thus encapsulating the relentless shabby chicifying of the past that is both hilarious and nauseating when are people going to realise that in eras such as downton the odds are that they wouldnt have been ringing for their butler at best theyd have been the butler and not on k either,2012-12,carla brunisarkozy fire declaring magazine ha use feminism dont need feminist generation told french vogue entire generation thats quite dont
