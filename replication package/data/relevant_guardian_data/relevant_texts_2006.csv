the following correction was printed in the guardians corrections and clarifications column tuesday january the above headline was a case of statistical simplification leading to exaggeration in the report below we said that of women are paid less than men in equivalent jobs of a sample is fewer than one in six almost one in five of the countrys biggest employers are breaking the law by paying women significantly lower wages than their male colleagues according to research by the equal opportunities commission a study by the commission of employers all of whom have reviewed their pay structures to check if they are paying equally found that are unlawfully discriminating against their female workers by paying them less than men to do the same job the eoc said that the true proportion was likely to be higher as these organisations were among the more enlightened employers having voluntarily undertaken pay reviews jenny watson chair of the commission told the guardian its bad enough that have found a pay gap that could be the subject of legal challenge following their equal pay review but even these figures mask the true extent of the problem the of companies which were breaking the law were found to have a gap between men and womens salaries which could only be explained by the workers gender in some cases women were routinely being paid less for doing the same job as their male colleagues the survey also revealed that women were routinely missing out on senior jobs starting on lower salaries and taking longer to get promoted largely because they were more likely to take career breaks to have children a review of lloyds tsbs wage bill revealed deep divisions in pay with highflying men reaping rewards in bonuses because the bank feared it might lose them men were also more likely to negotiate higher starting salaries when they joined the bank lloyds tsb has since overhauled its pay structures the new figures come as the government prepares to announce the full findings of the women and work commission which was charged by the prime minister with making recommendations on narrowing the gender pay gap tony blair is expected to launch its report next month equality campaigners are waiting to see whether experts who have been working for months on a plan to tackle unfair pay for women will recommend making pay reviews compulsory something which is opposed by many employers the eocs survey also reveals that the government is likely to miss a target designed to tackle discriminatory pay against women because employers are dragging their feet in conducting internal reviews of the pay gap between male and female workers only of large employers have conducted a review of salaries the governments target is for of large organisations to have reviewed pay by last year the pay gap between men and women was for fulltime workers and for parttime workers compared with and respectively five years ago in much of this is explained by women choosing to take career breaks to have families or opting for lower paid jobs socalled occupational segregation but a proportion of the gap is still attributed to employers discriminating against women susan henderson head of human resources policy at the confederation of british industry said that their own internal research revealed a different picture she said that of large employers had so far undertaken reviews and found little evidence of widespread discrimination of course there are some issues but it is not as great as the eoc suggests she said firms are stepping up to the issue they are talking about flexible working encouraging women back to work after having children and how we get young girls to consider different careers pay audits will not solve those problems ms watson said the eoc was calling for employers to carry out equality checks a lighter touch audit which would prompt a full pay review if discrepancies were found other causes of the pay gap such as job segregation and a lack of familyfriendly policies would be identified and employers would have an amnesty period in which to change pay systems a spokeswoman for the department for trade and industry

from the moment they give birth women get stuck on a mummy track of low pay and low prospects as their wages fall and never fully recover even when their children have left home a new study has found far from being a liberating release the point when their children start school marks another sudden slump in the average growth of womens pay compared with male wages according to the report by the institute for fiscal studies before they have children the average hourly wage for female workers is of the male average but declines to for working mothers juggling jobs and childcare their wages relative to men then stagnate for years before showing a modest recovery reports the study newborns and new schools but even when children have left home the average hourly wage for their mothers remained at of the male average rather than facilitate a largescale return to the workforce for women the moment their children enter fulltime school accelerates relative wage decline the average wage growth over two years for women before having children was but fell to for women with newborn children while it recovered to for those with preschool children it fell again to less than when their children entered school the aggregate proportion of mothers in work before their children began school compared with afterwards only rose slightly from in june to when term began in september there is a huge assumption that suddenly because the child is at school the mother can return to work said gillian paull a coauthor of the study for the department for work and pensions but school hours are far too short to cover most jobs and school brings with it a new set of responsibilities in terms of children needing input from parents and parents being involved in school life finding childcare that fits around school hours and the holidays is difficult unless you pay for expensive fulltime care only a small part of this gender wage gap is because mothers choose to work parttime for fulltime workers the gender wage ratio suffered a similar slump between childless women and working mothers with a decline from women commanding of male wages before children to just for those with children and for the group after children when researchers took account of other factors which might determine the gender wage gap such as gender differences in demographic background educational attainment and work characteristics and conditions they still found a substantial unexplained gender wage gap of for those before children for those living with children and for those whose children have grown up or left home the milliondollar question is are the wage levels different because working mothers are treated differently or is it that they choose a different way to behave in the labour market dr paull said working mothers could be suffering a wide pay gap because of pure discrimination or controversially some employers claim they do not pay as much because working mothers are not as productive as men thirdly dr paull said it could be that women were choosing jobs that fit in with the demands of motherhood finding work that was less physically demanding for instance so they could devote more energy to their families too many women get stuck on a mummy track of low pay and low prospects the pay gap for women working parttime at nearly has barely improved since the sex discrimination act was introduced years ago said caroline slocock the chief executive of the equal opportunities commission many women choose to work parttime but they dont choose low pay four in five parttime workers million people most of whom are women are working in jobs which do not use their potential because flexible and parttime work is too often lowstatus and underpaid this is a colossal waste of talent for employers and the economy as well as individuals the ifs study is published days before the women and work commission reports to tony blair after spending months looking at the problem of the gender pay gap the prime minister is expected to help launch the report next month which is expected to outline radical proposals to help women return to wellpaid work children represent a major part of the gender pay gap according to margaret prosser who chairs the women and work commission once women have children their job choices are hugely constrained either because they have to choose local work which provides fewer options or choose parttime employment where there are few jobs at a professional or senior level lady prosser said she was not surprised that figures showed womens pay stagnating even years after they have raised young children the majority of women who have children want to spend some time with those children what they would like is work that is sufficiently flexible but what they do not want is work that is always at the bottom of the ladder there is no silver bullet answer to this there has to be a whole range of policy proposals

the companies listed on norways stock exchange face being shut down unless they install women on their boards over the next two years in a radical initiative imposed by a government determined to help women break through the glass ceiling after a week in which the equal opportunities commission in britain has warned that it would take years for women to break into the ranks of the ftse in the same way as men norwegian companies face a twoyear deadline to ensure that women hold of the seats of each company listed on the oslo bourse new companies have to comply now with the rules and the government is considering extending the law to familyowned companies as well the requirement came into effect at the start of this year after companies were given two years to embrace the demands voluntarily following the passing of the law in stateowned companies are already obliged to comply and now have female representation on their boards the failure of companies to act about half of the companies on the stock market are estimated to have no women on their boards has prompted the norwegian equality minister karita bekkemellem to take the draconian step of threatening firms with closure from january i want to put in place a system of sanctions that will allow the closure of firms she said i do not want to wait another or years for men with enough intelligence to finally appoint women more than half of the people who have a business education today are women it is wrong for companies not to use them they should be represented it is a cry that is familiar to organisations such as britains equal opportunities commission which are trying to promote the elevation of women to boardrooms in britain the eocs report last week sex and power found that women make up only of directors in ftse companies and painted a bleak picture for the prospects of much improvement the british government tried to tackle the problem after a report into boardroom behaviour by the city grandee sir derek higgs highlighted the pale male phenomenon in companies there was an attempt to draw up a list of women who might be candidates for boards though laura dandrea tyson an academic and former adviser to president clinton who was charged with finding candidates decided in the end that such a list was unnecessary norways imposition of quotas seems unlikely to be embraced by britain the few women who have reached senior roles in british firms appear to oppose a target system deanna oppenheimer the american banker recently appointed to run barclays branch network says

uk retail operation and is one of two women holding executive positions on the lloyds board where helen weir is finance director ms weir wonders whether her job a profession requiring numbercrunching makes it easier for women to achieve a senior role however she is a reluctant role model for women eager to progress in business partly because of the worklife sacrifices required the tradeoffs i make wont necessarily work for everyone else she says adding that of her time is divided between work and her three children with the remaining fought over between her husband friends and herself ms oppenheimer acts as a mentor for men and women and believes women need to be very articulate to form points well and should work in environments that value performance if they want to get on like ms weir ms oppenheimer who has moved her two children to britain thinks a supportive home background is crucial i have two children and have a career she says you need a support structure a husband who is involved in norway women have been very successful in reaching top positions outside business in politics for instance a third of the countrys mps are women and nine of the cabinet ministers are women in britain of mps are women and the equal opportunities commission has warned that it could take another elections for equality with men to be reached the nearequality of norwegian women in politics might explain the determination to tackle underrepresentation in business where of company directors are women the law being implemented was the brainchild of the former businessman ansgar gabrielsen a trade and industry minister in the former government the law was not about getting equality between the sexes it was about the fact that diversity is a value in itself that it creates wealth from my time in the business world i saw how board members were picked they come from the same small circle of people they go hunting and fishing together they are buddies he said perhaps unsurprisingly the norwegian business community is opposed to the governments attempts to interrupt the status quo businesses would prefer a more flexible approach such as organising networking events where companies can meet potential candidates the confederation of norwegian enterprise nho has a database of women and claims that a quarter of them have been offered management or board positions sigrun vaageng of the nho said the punishment is completely disproportionate it is far too harsh to close a company just because it lacks one woman she doubts whether the government will carry out its threat it is science fiction to think that the government is going to shut down a company that employs thousands of people over this she said some companies are completely opposed to the law and are waiting to see if the government will use the sanctions according to marit hoel head of the centre for corporate diversity but ms bekkemellem the equality minister seems convinced that firms will not risk it are there companies that will risk closure just because they lack one woman they have another two years to fix the situation she warns,2006-01,company listed norway stock exchange face shut

why did you help set up the network i felt it was important to pay homage to the highspirited females who have struggled throughout the ages and who continue to struggle while championing the interests of black women and their families across the world the network is there to provide support advice and training in leadership and management for black women from all walks of life my role is to manage the network does a glass ceiling exist for black women managers we know its there but unfortunately we are too busy trying to keep our feet on the first rung of the ladder are black women managers stereotyped black women are still typified as caterers and anything to do with the hospitality hair and beauty profession the perception is that we are single parents without any support network therefore we cant be successful businesswomen how does the mentoring programme work it will allow successful women to work with young women going into business and professional women to give them some support and encouragement professional women and women in business are often isolated within the workplace how will the network operate with employers we will be making links with employers across the region to encourage them to enrol black women employees on leadership and management training programmes we will offer advice and guidance where its needed on issues pertaining to culture race and gender do the public and private sectors have different attitudes towards black women managers more black women are to be found in the public sector this might be because of equality policies even if it is not true equality recently several black women brought in to tackle difficult schools and projects found themselves out in the cold after achieving success the private sector wouldnt discard managers who turned their company around they would offer longterm contracts and bonuses maybe the public sector needs to learn from the private sector about valuing good staff and the private sector from the public sector about working towards true equalities what is the best piece of management advice you have been given not everyone has to be your friend they dont even have to like you

women of childbearing age will be turned down for jobs because of government plans to increase maternity leave the tories have claimed in what will be seen as a uturn on promises to stop being the voice of the business lobby the conservatives are threatening a showdown later this month over plans to give new mothers nine months paid leave instead of the current six and let men take more time off after the birth of a child they will demand changes when the legislation comes before mps to ease what they say is an unfair burden on employers which could backfire by encouraging them not to hire young women who might get pregnant just before christmas the confederation of british industry announced it could not support the plans the move comes despite david camerons pledge to the observer only two weeks ago that he did not want to be the mouthpiece of business which he followed with femalefriendly calls for an end to unequal pay eleanor laing the conservative spokeswoman on womens issues insisted the party was not opposed to longer leave in principle and it was precisely because her party had womens interests at heart that she expected to table amendments to the governments work and families bill we need to make sure we dont put too many burdens on business she said if we make it so difficult for employers then they just wont employ women of childbearing age the governments bill would allow women to take nine months paid maternity leave from april once the first six months were past some of that leave could be transferred to their partners if the woman went back to work although the cost of maternity pay itself is met by the state the cbi argues that for small employers the system will be expensive and difficult to administer and had wanted the government to ensure the inland revenue would do it for them the chancellor rejected that idea late last year saying it would cost the taxpayer million a year under cameron the tories have striven to shed their oldfashioned image as the party of stayathome mothers his own wife samantha works as creative director of the stationery firm smythsons and the couple have spoken about the pressures of juggling careers and children however the work and families bill represents the first concrete test of new thinking in practice a source close to alan johnson the trade and industry secretary said it

britain must reeducate schoolgirls to chose higher earning careers or condemn another generation of women to the pay and opportunities gap a governmentbacked commission warned yesterday female workers suffer one of the biggest pay gaps in europe for full time staff and for part time because they are more likely to be in low paid jobs and then slip further down the career ladder after having children the women and work commission found schools should challenge gender stereotypes by teaching allgirl computer classes for example while employers should improve the options for women who want to work parttime after having children it concluded but the commission was last night accused of shortchanging women by failing to recommend new legally binding ways to force companies to tackle discriminatory pay the commission made up of members from equality groups industry and education and backed by tony blair recommended better careers guidance to prevent girls falling into lowpaid womens jobs such as catering and cleaning a m package to improve womens skills and a m initiative to promote quality parttime work more parents should have the right to request flexible working without penalising their careers and the chancellor should consider incentives to make it possible for smaller employers to meet such requests it said the commission was split on the issue of compulsory equal pay audits which some unions argue are crucial to exposing discrimination in pay and making employers accountable for making it fairer katherine rake director of the fawcett society said by not introducing mandatory pay checks the commission had pandered to employers this report has shortchanged a generation of women if this government wants to go down in history as having closed the pay gap its going to have to try a lot harder the time is long overdue for rigorous measures john cridland deputy director general of the cbi told a press conference i was staggered at how poor careers advice and education has become we are failing a whole generation of young people essentially young girls he described the report as a winwin for businesses which did not include any additional burdens the report argues that there is a bn advantage for businesses in narrowing the pay gap because of the improvements in retention of staff many women are working day in day out far below their abilities said the commission chairwoman lady prosser this waste of talent is an outrage the commissioners also encouraged the ongoing discrimination law review to look sympathetically at allowing women workers to take class action suits rather than having to take individual pay claims to a tribunal and to use hypothetical comparison points in complex cases where women were unable to compare themselves to male workers the nhs and local government have thousands of little actions class action would make life much easier said lady prosser they have been seen to be successful in other countries jenny watson chair of the equal opportunities commission welcomed the report she said thirty years after the sex discrimination act we need to think about the law too where modernisation is needed the wwc proposal for the governments discrimination law review to consider the adoption of class actions and hypothetical comparators is a good place to start mr blair described the report as a superb groundbreaking piece of work as he appointed tessa jowell to produce an action plan to take forward its findings the tories said unequal pay based on sex discrimination was completely and totally unacceptable the shadow chancellor george osborne announced a review of the partys childcare policies he said in the past the conservatives have given the impression that young mothers should stay at home today the labour party gives the impression that all young mothers should work both are wrong we should support the choice that mothers make for themselves the partys social justice policy group would examine ways of offering wider childcare provision recommendations government action to tackle gender stereotypes at school encourage skilled

to fight or to conciliate conciliate most lowpaid women decide put off by the complexity involved in a claim for discrimination seasoned with the fear of being branded troublemakers the governments women and work commission faced with a similar dilemma and a deep split among its members has opted to conciliate too hence its report yesterday ducking the compulsory pay audits that campaigning organisations believe are the single most important weapon to resolve the grotesque inequality of mens and womens pay the commission paints a predictable but still shocking portrait of the continuing ignorance and unchanging assumptions it highlights the damage caused by occupational segregation and low expectations it is easy to mock but the stereotypical characters of books for preschoolers remain a key influence along with a childs own experience of a world of women carers women cooks women cashiers and women checkout assistants the commission found these early impressions are reinforced all through school by teachers who know nothing of other work subject choices that duck computing and sciences and feeble adventures in work experience no wonder even women graduates are earning less than male counterparts within three years of leaving college so the attention to cultural change is necessary and desirable but it is not enough privately trade union members on the commission admit they thought they could get further by avoiding a fight at this stage they believe the onus is now on employers to prove that as the cbis john cridland insisted pay inequality is not their fault but they must act quickly to make it clear that they believe pay audits are likely to be indispensible this is especially so if they are expanded as the equal opportunities commission would like into equality checks that examine other barriers like access to flexible working the poor quality of most part time work and the insistance that more senior positions are full time without this there is a risk the whole report will be dismissed as another exercise in cosying up to business the commission will regroup in a year to investigate progress but this should be an annual event perhaps an even bigger danger is that the government now working on a onceinageneration review of discrimination law feels it is off the hook before they heave a sigh of relief ministers should

an elephant the size of several cabinet tables remained skilfully unmentioned when tony blair and gordon brown jointly launched the women and work commission report today at no writes polly toynbee the facts about womens unfair pay are wellknown because they never change much women are paid less than men and if they work parttime then they are paid less per hour they inhabit the bottom rungs of most ladders which is why the minimum wage did more to help their pay than anything else in the years since the equal pay act was passed the commissions chair trade unionist baroness prosser calls it an outrage and so it is the report makes plenty of useful suggestions why arent more women engineers why dont they do sciences at school leading to higher pay why dont they aspire to top paid jobs if only girls would be more like boys there would be no problem this is the one thing all the members of the commission from the cbi the unions and the government could safely agree on blame the women themselves for making such silly choices but the elephant is this women are lower paid than men because the work they do is undervalued why should the valuable work a woman does caring for small children in a nursery or looking after the bedridden in a nursing home be rewarded at a far lower rate than say a lorry driver pay rates are set by pure tradition and prejudice nothing to do with skill and certainly not social value if women all do as they are instructed retrain and move upwards to higher paid work then who will clean the hospital floors take classroom assistant jobs and serve in restaurants presumably yet another wave of new immigrants destined to be just as poor and probably mainly women too in these service sector jobs it is no answer to gross inequality the only answer is to pay people fairly why do women congregate in cooking cleaning caring work mothers have few choices its easily available work at flexible parttime hours whereas the report points out more senior jobs are rarely ever parttime but the report discusses at length the ways girls and boys are pushed into gender stereotypes just think of the choice in childrens toys and how hard it is to find anything genderneutral everything is branded spiderman or barbie from infancy role models matter girls are naturally drawn to what they see other women do all the same heres a report whose recommendations will probably be taken up by the government and most of them are good if inadequate there will be more audits of whether women are being fairly paid in the public sector they want all jobs to be made part time with flexible hours women will get better retraining chances at work but in the end if women are really to be paid more then the work they do will have to be properly valued

the pay gap between men and women in britain is one of the worst in europe but this is not the fault of employers a governmentappointed commission concluded today a report by the women and work commission made businessfriendly recommendations aimed at boosting pay and opportunities for women after it found that women were paid on average less than men the gap among parttime workers was it found tony blair responded to the report which he commissioned in by appointing the culture secretary and minister for women tessa jowell to produce an action plan to take up the recommendations but the report has angered trade unions and equality campaigners by failing to call for companies to carry out compulsory pay audits to ensure that women are not paid less than men the equal pay charity the fawcett society said the report had shortchanged a generation of women john cridland deputy director general of the confederation of british industry and one of the commissioners said the pay gap was absolutely not the fault of employers instead the commission focused on poor careers advice for girls in schools mr cridland said he was staggered at how poor the guidance was in secondary schools speaking at a news conference to launch the report he said that by concentrating on the most disadvantaged children school careers services had degraded the quality of advice to the majority of boys and girls the commission calculated that the economy was losing up to bn a year because womens talents were being wasted many women are working day in day out far below their abilities the commission chairwoman lady prosser said she added this waste of talent is an outrage at a time when the uk is facing increasing competition in the global marketplace and an outrage for those women personally if we do not make the fundamental change necessary to our school and workplace cultures those new jobs and opportunities will be filled in the same old way and women will continue to lose out the report pointed out that countries such as sweden and denmark had much lower pay gaps despite having similarly high levels of female employment diana holland national organiser for women race and equality at the tampg union was disappointed by the report she said being a woman still means being paid less a quarter less than men without pay audits employers will be vulnerable to thousands of individual costly equal pay cases recommendations included innovative schemes to give schoolgirls a better understanding of pay and prospects in different careers as well as improved training for women returning to work after having children work experience should also be transformed so as to encourage girls to consider nontraditional jobs and to promote apprenticeships for women in professions where skilled workers were in demand the report said it found that womens work was undervalued with jobs in caring cleaning and catering being less well rewarded than mens jobs such as labouring or driving that required similar levels of skills the commission urged the government to back a m package to raise skill levels among women and help them change careers its report said we found no single easy solution or magic bullet rather we identified a set of solutions which taken together will lead us towards a fairer society and a more efficient economy dr katherine rake the director of the fawcett society said these measures alone will not bring change quickly enough for women up and down the country who are currently being paid too little if this government wants to go down in history as having closed the pay gap it is going to have to try a lot harder the report came on the day the conservatives admitted they were wrong to suggest the only place for young mothers was in the home but

womens childcare responsibilities are the key cause of the pay gap employers welcome the reports recommendations to ensure that parttime work is not seen as a second class option and to give women returners the training they need to access better paid jobs girls outperform boys at school and university but too many choose lower paid occupations in caring and clerical professions the reports recommendations to overcome occupational segregation a major cause of the pay gap will require educators and employers to work together to revolutionise careers advice and work experience old

still lags behind the rest of europe this is not a lack of understanding it is a lack of political will to do anything about the problem not only are parttime women workers lower paid they are often

equality campaigners and trade unions have attacked a report into women and work before its publication this morning because its recommendations do not include any demands for legal changes such as mandatory pay audits the longawaited paper by the women and work commission will warn that the pay and opportunities gap is damaging the economy and propose a range of measures to tackle problems such as occupational segregation but derek simpson general secretary of amicus said the report shaping a fairer future had deliberately missed the point by not demanding compulsory pay audits senior labour mps were also surprised it had not gone further simply encouraging employers to change is not going to work fast enough said katherine rake director of the fawcett society which campaigns for greater opportunities for women women have waited too long for this government to take action at the current rate it is going to take more than years to close the fulltime pay gap and around to end the parttime pay gap fulltime women workers earn less than their male counterparts while parttime workers suffer from a gap lady prosser head of the commission and a former president of the tuc has warned that unions misunderstand the issue and blame direct discrimination unequal wages for the same work for the pay gap underlying issues include womens concentration in lower paying occupations and in the lower paid ranks of most fields often because it is easier to find part time work a source close to the commission said members had split on issues including pay audits but added they havent gone for a quick fix because there isnt one but a senior labour mp said equal pay audits are not just a gimmick they are absolutely critical the division of labour in the home is one of the things which holds women back at work they will always need to be the ones to take the time off if men are getting paid more some of the report is useful but i dont exactly think its done as much as it should have

womens pay is being held back by stuffed shirt bosses who do not back them for the most senior jobs according to the chair of a major investigation into the pay gap the women at work commission will warn that more than years after pay discrimination was supposedly outlawed there are still too few women in the boardroom and too many stuck in lowly jobs who are capable of much more a syndrome that costs the economy billion a year in wasted talent however it will say that direct sexism is not the main reason why women earn p for every pound a man earns instead a shortage of parttime work at senior levels with many employers reluctant to let managers jobshare or reduce their hours drives women with young children into lowlier positions parttime women earn p an hour for every pound a fulltime man gets the commission chaired by trade unionist margaret prosser will set up a pilot project with bluechip companies offering senior management posts on a parttime basis to prove it can be done without profits suffering prosser told the observer that there were enlightened employers trying to get more women in the boardroom who showed it was possible the more you have these kind of male role models the more other stuffed shirts are going to see that this is not the end of life as we know it the pay gap for parttimers in particular was a disgrace and there was no reason why highflying jobs could not be parttime she said most companies dont offer decent parttime employment you can go to work in a supermarket and do any hours you like on a shop floor but if you want to be a manager you have to do a hour week the commission will also back the introduction of americanstyle class actions for unfair pay which mean that a ruling in favour of one woman automatically benefits others who are in the same position and better school careers advice for girls tony blair who set up the commission will launch its findings tomorrow alongside gordon brown the chancellor said to have been struck by the injustice of the commissions findings will unveil a multimillionpound package in next months budget to help mothers returning to work but the commission found the pay gap had its roots in schools with girls more likely to choose badly paid careers such as the caring professions over lucrative sectors such as science and engineering prosser said pupils interviewed by the commission were being badly advised working women were also less likely to demand pay rises she said but the real pay crisis came with children prosser said research from the london school of economics showed mothers returning parttime to their old job quickly fell behind male colleagues but women taking a new parttime job did even worse youve only got to spend a couple of years parttime and that scars your career for many many years because it takes you so long to catch up the minister for women tessa jowell said too many women with children were being forced to forgo a career we cannot tolerate the pay gap as a fact of life when it means injustice for women and loss to the economy i hope the impact of this report will be profound the road to equality girls outperform boys at gcse a level and now at degree level but within three years of graduating female employees are earning less than men in the year before sex discrimination was outlawed only per cent of managers were women now per cent are female says the equal opportunities commission the pay gap per cent in when the equal pay act came in has almost halved at the current rate of progress says the fawcett society it will be years before equal pay comes in about per cent of women are in jobs beneath their skills and qualifications if traditionally male job barriers were scrapped gdp would rise by up to per cent or

sexual discrimination is rife in certain professions but it affects men as well as women according to research which challenges the traditional notion that women are the only victims of sexism in job applications researchers found significant evidence of a bias against men in jobs for chartered accountants and computer analysts which are already considered more gender neutral than some while women are being passed over for engineering jobs because of their gender men are even more likely to be turned away from secretarial posts the study blames embedded ideas about what jobs men and women should do or occupational segregation judy rich an economist at portsmouth business school and coauthor of the report with peter a riach said these findings raise questions about why men are discriminated against whats it saying about the embeddedness of sexual stereotypes in england it suggests that legislation which has been around to tackle sexual discrimination for years is making no inroad she added there is no legislation which requires affirmative action but perhaps some employers are preempting it in the accountancy and computing sectors or they could be in the progress of resegregating and becoming more female as was the case with bank tellers the economists sent off two fake applications for more than jobs in the four professions each applicant had equal experience qualifications and age profiling but one bore a mans name the other a womans they found women were half as likely to be invited for an interview for an engineering job compared with men and men were nearly four times less likely than women to get an interview for the secretarial posts men also faced significant bias in accountancy where of the workforce is already female and in the computer analyst jobs where one in five is a woman the pay gap between men and women currently stands at the women and work commission will report on monday it is expected to focus on occupational segregation and in particular why women are far more likely to be in lowpaying jobs the report is expected to ask for example why femaledominated caring professions such as nursing and childcare are paid much less than maledominated construction jobs but critics will argue that by focusing on this the report will miss an opportunity to insist that the government should tighten up the gender equality laws and crack down on businesses which fail to tackle the problem kate bellamy senior policy officer at the womens campaigning group the fawcett society said concentration of men and women in different jobs is an issue and we should be about enabling women and men to move into nontraditional roles if they want to but we need more urgent action now to ensure the work women do is valued we want to see the government set targets for closing the pay gap jenny watson chair of the equal opportunities commission said discrimination does occur against men and its important to tackle the barriers however

where has the urgency gone when it comes to childcare i know its an urgent issue and thousands of families know that its an urgent issue debates about it are taking place everywhere from park playgrounds to thinktank conference rooms and yet nothing much seems to be changing every now and again a government reform dribbles out piecemeal shortterm funding to enable betterqualified people to go into nursery work or yet another layer of tax credits or vouchers to give partial help with the costs of childcare to those families who are sufficiently numerate to disentangle their entitlements but the great need that lies at the heart of so many families experiences is still not being addressed i know that childcare is far from the only hurdle when it comes to getting the right balance between work and family life there are vital battles to be fought on getting fathers to participate more in caring on challenging the overwork culture and on providing more financial help for parents staying at home those all constitute essential building blocks to progress but we are often bypassing the continuing need for better childcare the result of the current poor balance between work and family life as the ippr report published this week makes clear is that many women are simply choosing not to have so many babies are they learning from those women who have found that as soon as they do have children their choices evaporate the pressure is intense when you have children either to work like crazy to afford very expensive childcare so losing out on the irreplaceable joy of family life or to stop working altogether and find yourself losing out on the fun status and income of working life feminists novelists journalists and campaigners have been banging on about the need for a better balance between work and home for many years yet it is still a distant dream for too many families i am incredibly lucky in this way since the kind of work i do means i can go on with it and still pick my daughter up from school more often than not but being a selfemployed writer is not what most women do most employers are still dragging their heels over making flexible work viable and most parttime work is not sufficiently well rewarded to allow women to buy in goodquality childcare how can we leapfrog this great barrier to womens equality and inject more urgency into this debate one way is to stop framing the argument around childcare as if its a standup fight between two uncompromising positions neither of which are that enticing those positions are fulltime stayathome motherhood on the one hand and fulltime childcare in nurseries on the other this is the stark alternative sold to us by almost everyone especially guiltinducing experts such as steve biddulph who gets massive attention for saying that the mother should stay home in the first year and that nurseries are no good for kids under two years if you dont buy into this stark alternative then its hard to get your voice heard but most parents do not go for fulltime parenting nor do they drop their kids off at fulltime nursery as soon as they can and rush off to work thats because we really dont need any parenting experts to tell us that nurseries can be horribly cold and unresponsive places for babies many parents do listen to their hearts and dont want to hear the sad cries of their children as they leave them in a room with a stranger run ragged by the needs of three or more babies that doesnt mean we dont want any childcare what does the care we want actually look like looking at my own situation and those of the parents i know i can see that many parents are setting up a kind of patchwork of care it might be parttime nanny or childminder care in the first two years adding in parttime nursery care after that switching to an au pair once the child is older and with friends and ones own parents filling in the gaps where that combination of care works and it can work wonderfully well it does so because it puts the needs of a child to the fore of course young children need a close loving bond with their carer but the best childcare workers know this and succeed in providing it what parents want is to be financially enabled to make various choices at various times which necessarily entails tax relief on all forms of childcare at the moment the financial help on offer for homebased care is absurdly overcomplicated a mixture of tax credits for lowincome families and vouchers delivered through companies in its baroque stinginess it is failing too many families it is also failing too many childcare workers who are forced to work for low pay or in the black economy because parents still cant afford to pay them properly we badly need a more straightforward and generous system of tax relief that delivers for all families using all kinds of carers so that women can make the choices they want to make one reason why the urgency has gone out of this debate is because women feel ashamed talking about their desire for childcare at all its ok to argue for better funding for parents to spend time with their kids which yes has to be part of the equation but it makes you feel like a bad mum if you also talk about employing other care but we shouldnt feel ashamed of wanting to bring in other people to give our children love and care alongside us at its best good childcare need not impoverish childhood and can provide a wider circle of people for a child to love and enjoy the shame that has surrounded this issue means that what i think is the best kind of care for babies other than parental care nannies based in the family home are still the preserve of the wealthy minority but its horribly elitist to say that it should stay that way and that more families shouldnt be enabled to buy in homebased care if they want to this issue also suffers from the overpersonalisation of all feminist debate women who struggle to set up the right childcare for their families tend to see it as a purely personal struggle and a purely personal failing if they cant find the right care at their income level that means we have lost sight of the need for the state to enable parents who are not hugely wealthy to make the choices they want i have said that its women who struggle to set up the childcare because by and large this is the case you dont hear many men talking about the cost of childcare about how they worry about whether the nursery workers are giving their child enough love about the problems of leaving their own child with a childminder about

britain is suffering a baby shortage with potentially disastrous consequences as work pressures force young women to shelve plans for a family according to dramatic new research urging an bn campaign to boost parenthood women have not turned against becoming mothers and if they could have the number of children they actually wanted more than extra babies a year would be born according to calculations by the respected thinktank the institute for public policy research but the report says the professional and financial penalties of childbearing a midskilled yearold who gives birth will earn less over her lifetime than a childless counterpart as motherhood narrows her career options mean many are delaying pregnancy until it may be too late to conceive the baby gap emerging between maternal desire and reality now threatens a demographic crisis as too few children are born to support future elderly dependants the study warns by the year when many born now will be retiring the pressure on public spending from an ageing population could require an p rise in income tax if births are at the lowest end of official forecasts with childlessness now forecast on a scale not seen since the mass male fatalities of the first world war destroyed many womens hopes of motherhood the ippr urges government intervention to raise the birth rate by making working parenthood more appealing to both mothers and fathers it advocates free nursery places for twoyearolds paternity leave paid at per cent of a mans salary and three months of paid parental leave to be taken at any point before the child is five with one month reserved for fathers that would cost up to bn a year by about for every british man woman and child this is not a report that says to women stay at home

commission on working women to be published shortly and has been struck by evidence of mothers being trapped in deadend lowpaid parttime work jenny watson head of the equal opportunities commission said the baby gap partly reflected women changing their minds or not meeting the right man but she added it should tell us that we dont have a very familyfriendly culture and it should concern us britain has too many women remaining involuntarily childless the report concludes while high fertility and early childbirth is systematically associated with severely reduced prospects if women had had by the age of the number of children they wanted when they were aged between and the birth rate would be per cent higher it calculates only five per cent said they did not originally want children yet four times as many were childless by their late thirties mike dixon coauthor with julia margo of the report said there were very similar patterns for male hopes of fatherhood although data is less

how do we maintain harmony in our family business do you have any good advice for members of families who work in the family firm in particular where there is a conflict around the working relationship between parent and child where the parent is the major decisionmakerfinancer of the company but both do the work it seems to be an opportunity for creative ideas but also negative feelings ive always had great admiration for family firms that make it work on the face of it the difficulties would seem to be far greater than in conventional companies in a family firm the parent figure is very often the founding figure as well so it follows that he its usually a he has a deepseated and understandable sense of proprietorship to him his company is as much his child as his actual children he is even more of an authoritarian than your average boss in a normal company when a principal takes on an assistant thats when their association starts the assistant is first encountered as a thinking able adult and accepted as such in a family company the principal takes on an assistant hes known since birth and whose frailties and adolescent embarrassments remain in recent memory its hard enough at the best of times for fathers to allow their sons and daughters to emerge from the playpen and become real people its harder still when they become working members of the family firm but with all that early baggage still attached and theres another complication thats unique to family firms in the minds of everyone founding father siblings and nonfamily workers alike there lurks an unspoken question would jack or natalie ever have been offered these positions had they not been the children of the founder where it seems to work best is where all members of the family shed their family identities whenever theyre at work father doesnt refer to his daughter as a daughter and she doesnt call him dad its ron and janet just as it would be if they were unrelated come sunday lunchtime of course they can and should relax and revert if this doesnt happen instinctively try suggesting it itll probably seem very contrived and uncomfortable at first but after a time it should become habitual and greatly reduce tensions it also allows for a freer sense of healthy competition trying to be creatively competitive in a family firm can be worse than playing scrabble with your parents my senior managers leave me out of the decisionmaking loop i run a semiautonomous division of a larger company we are performing adequately in financial terms although we could do better we have come under scrutiny by some of the companys senior managers who believe our division needs a serious overhaul this may be true but i hate the fact that much of the decisionmaking is done behind closed doors and i am informed of decisions rather than involved in them its hard to run something when the controls are taken out of ones hands is there a way to bridge this them and us situation without alienating senior managers i dont like the sound of the phrase semiautonomous its not exactly halfpregnant but its heading in that direction it certainly opens the door to endless ambiguities and fuzzily defined areas of responsibility much your best chance is to reclaim the initiative which youve clearly lost you say your division is performing adequately another ominous word theres not much space between adequate and inadequate you also say it could do better so what are you going to do to make sure it does draw up a proper business plan with benchmarks action points and milestones make sure its tough but achievable ask for a meeting with those senior managers present your plan and request authority to proceed you certainly cant be criticised for trying to take management back into your own hands its what you think and hope youre paid for and their response to your proposals should settle the definition of semiautonomous once and for all just dont expect autonomy to be granted as a right sorry to be so obvious but it has to be earned are there ad agencies that value skills in the developing markets three years ago i went freelance to combine my brand advertising experience with communication work on hivaids projects in the developing world india and nepal among other places the latter is on track and i would now like to use my experience to target ad agencies in london with global networks who may need someone like me whats the best way to go about this i want to get on with it if only i knew how your timing for once may be to your advantage you might still be a little bit premature but your prospects i suspect may be better than they were even a couple of years ago london agencies and at least some of their clients are taking more notice of issuebased marketing the brighter ones are also waking up to the fact that communications techniques employed in the socalled developing markets might just have a great deal to offer us as you know social marketers in the regions with which youre familiar have had to employ a great deal of imagination and originality with few of the conventional media that we take for granted and with a confusion of languages dialects and illiteracy improvisation has been the answer today in the socalled developed markets questions are being asked about the efficacy of many conventional media new media thinkers talk about experiential marketing and buzz marketing viral techniques and ambient media are presented as if they were fresh out of the new media oven in the socalled underdeveloped markets of course by one name or another theyre tried and tested id start by making your number with some of the bigger media planning and buying agencies serving the bigger

its almost as if sexism has gone out of fashion not apparently sexism itself but any discussion of what to do about it on monday february however tony blair will make an attempt to focus attention on it again with the launch of a report he commissioned to find out why in years after the sex discrimination act there is still a pay gap between men and women even this does not tell the whole story according to the equal opportunities commission eoc when you look at the gap between male and female parttimers it is a shocking the prime ministers women and work commission in which the eoc has played a leading role will recommend ways to close that gap its proposals are expected to attempt to reframe the debate about the pay gap arguing that direct discrimination is only one part of the equation and that the major cause of unequal pay is a structure of working that is designed for and by men caroline slocock chief executive of the eoc says discrimination is just one of three major factors responsible for the pay gap the others are womens responsibilities at home which means they work parttime take more time off work and cannot commit to an obsessive culture of presenteeism and something the eoc has labelled occupational segregation women taking lower paid lower status jobs there is a big class issue women who go to university have more knowledge about whats available to them and more time to mull it over slocock says its important that schools give these options to girls who dont go down that route but she adds relatively recent graduates earn less too its not just an issue that affects workingclass women one key element is childcare this phenomenon of trading down to fit your family affects graduates as much as anyone at the moment women see it as inevitable if i want a family i will have to work differently that shouldnt be the case professor marilyn davidson a management psychologist at manchester business school says there is direct discrimination we know that during job interviews women are offered less money from director level to people on the shop floor this is related psychologically to women being worth less than men but sometimes women dont equate the importance of pay with status as men do a study often quoted on this subject advertised for a senior management role at a year they did not get one female applicant when they readvertised the same details but with a price tag they were inundated psychological barrier women are offered lower starting salaries then are less likely to negotiate than men and once in a job are not as adept at asking for pay rises says davidson there is a psychological barrier men ask for perks while women ask for satisfaction its a socialisation thing men are still regarded as breadwinners its the fault of organisations if they did pay audits to ensure equality of pay this would help narrow the gap sandra not her real name works in an advertising firm she knew the money she was offered when she started was not great but it was her first fulltime job and the job she wanted above all others she did not question the wage six years on she regrets the decision which she now realises means she is always going to be on a lower rung of the ladder than she ought to be theres always rumours of what other people earn and i cant believe how much more it is than me she says if i think about it too much it does my head in but i love my job and just focus on that i feel lucky to be doing what i do jacqueline granleese an occupational psychologist at the university of east anglia school of management strongly rejects any notion that women themselves might be responsible for being underpaid but she does recognise that the nature of power structures in some workplaces can work against them women tend to underestimate their abilities speaking very generally they look for people managers externally to reinforce their belief in themselves men have a greater internalisation of their own confidence women talk about their weaknesses men talk about their abilities last week i was with a firm that has partners and only one woman another woman was offered partnership and turned it down because she thought she was being overpromoted what man would do that slocock is dismissive of the idea that women are not making the same demands as men theres not much evidence that supports that she says preferring to point towards the more measurable issues of working hours and childcare responsibilities it may be an element but our research shows there are very concrete things at play worklife balance issues and occupational segregation and its important that women stand up for themselves on those what the women and work commission will do is likely to be strongly influenced by the eoc its interim report focused on the parttime jobs on offer to women who want to balance their work with a family so many of which are lowpaid and lowstatus a focus on education to shift the stereotyping of schoolleavers and give young women a chance to do more highly paid jobs is likely to feature prominently but such recommendations are likely to bring with them accusations that the report has been watered down to make it palatable to the business element that has been involved in the commission the pay gap is not only bigger in the private sector but there are already laws in the pipeline to narrow it in the public sector initial soundings on recommendations for compulsory equal pay reviews which would expose inequalities and force bosses to address them are understood to have been dropped institutional changes what is important slocock says is that there should be a shift towards institutional changes and away from the current onus on individuals to go to tribunals to challenge unfair pay we need to move in a different direction at the moment women are forced to tackle this as individuals we need a more preventative model that has more flexible working and choice for women the government has to do that women often see these issues as a personal thing its a public policy thing that the government needs to lead on she says but others say a carrot is not enough to change such entrenched issues and a stick is needed to beat bosses into shape dr katherine rake director of the womens organisation the fawcett society which is not on the commission says women have waited nine years for action from this government and we fear the women and work commission report will not go far enough encouragement for businesses to change will not be enough we need the government to introduce strong enforcement measures to combat discrimination and narrow the pay gap were years on from the equal pay act and we cant put up with this any longer the fear is that the biggest opportunity to address the issue of sexism in the workplace will be missed so you think you earn less than your male colleagues cary cooper professor of work psychology at lancaster university says before you do anything let the boss know how well youre doing for a period of weeks before you approach him or her drop them emails pointing out things youve done that deal worked out well im really pleased or we got the new contract arrange to see your boss but dont let them know why ask for five minutes for a chat they should be intrigued when you get in there start out positively i love what im doing its working out well talk about your recent successes again tell them you feel youre worth more perhaps compare yourself with what you think people elsewhere are earning make sure youre right but not with colleagues within the organisation its unlikely you can be sure of what your colleagues earn and if you get it wrong you will look bad comparing your earnings with other companies might also hint that youve been offered something else lots of people would go in and say ive got something else i wouldnt recommend that in case they say fine i cant compete go you might also say you want more challenges and with that more money if they say no then go if youre doing a good job you will get work elsewhere have confidence the equal opportunities commission says if you think you are being paid less than a man for doing the same job or a job of the same value in the first instance you could approach your employer informally to discuss it many employers are forwardthinking and will adopt a positive approach towards finding a solution to your problem if this doesnt work you should write a letter of grievance to your employer and wait days for a reply your employer should set up a meeting to discuss your grievance you have the right to take a trade union representative or trusted colleague with you if your grievance is not upheld you have the right to appeal against the decision and should exercise this right if all these measures fail you may decide to take a case to the employment tribunal you will need a solicitor which your trade union can provide or the eoc can

lefties bbc made me feel quite nostalgic for a bygone age of womenonly households where male cats let alone male children were unwelcome and where the catering my spies told me consisted largely of pulses and unidentifiable meatfree slurry last nights film told the story of the revolutionary feminists who decided among other things that men were the enemy as well as being potential rapists and that penetration was fundamental to the system of oppression they split the human race along gender lines men bad women good and from then on their story was a tragedy or a comedy depending on your point of view from that fundamental split came others and it was soon clear that while all women were good some women were better than others everyone seemed to agree that the points system whereby a disabled black workingclass lesbian trumped all comers undermined the movement and led to everyone fighting for oneupwomanship one woman blamed the glc which poured m of public money into womens projects over four years for funding the movement out of existence thats not so much biting the hand that feeds you as gnawing it off to the elbow the witnesses to this process of disillusion spoke with varying degrees of understanding to some revolutionary feminism was a staging post on the way to maturity they could laugh about the sartorial and linguistic dogma of the period flat shoes no makeup and the stillhilarious concept of herstory others however had changed little and were still proud to be angry even after decades of selflacerating ideology in the name of freedom they cherished rage as the focus of their identity i always thought that hatred and egotism were male vices but apparently not i knew and worked with a few of the women featured in lefties and remember an awful lot of walking on eggshells as well as some hairraising meetings in lambeth town hall while they shed their high heels and wiped off their makeup there were dozens of men in their wake just as eager to put them on which led to some very entertaining nights in pubs round brixton and kings cross a wellscrubbed feminist friend once succumbed to the lure of cosmetics it was like that scene in black narcissus when the nun puts on lipstick most of these women seemed on the evidence of lefties to be much saner and happier people today as we all should be in middle life but for all that their ideology was undermined by identity politics its hard not to miss the bracing farsighted critique that revolutionary feminism brought to popular culture they tripped up over porn and became procensorship a conundrum that was never resolved but watching television in with its routine contempt for humanity in general and women in particular its easy to long for the simplistic arguments of youth lets take a rev fem look for instance at who do you think you are bbc in which director gurinder chadha bend it like beckham traced her family tree from southall back to india and pakistan via kenya her focus throughout was on the male line from her father through his father his father before him and right back to the army of maharajah ranjit singh the lion of the punjab while home to chadha meant southall and her mothers delicious pakoras identity was exclusively patrilineal i could practically hear the banshee wail of the few remaining revolutionary feminists out there was her mothers story not worth telling and what of the men and women who didnt have children considering the shame that surrounded a mixedrace relationship in chadhas ancestry one can only imagine the deeper silence that would surround any kind of sexual heterodoxy chadha seemed like a very nice woman and her family story was a gripper full of global travel political disaster and personal adversity i hope she makes a feature film about it one day as presented in who do you think you are though it told us most about the very selective way in which we construct our identity even more shocking was the

how important should childcare strategies be for employers very in terms of staffemployer relations recruitment and retention encouraging women to return to work after maternity leave and general staff loyalty what are the dangers of not having a good childcare strategy managers might invest a lot of time and resources in training people and then lose them to a rival employer with a more flexible and positive approach to employees childcare needs how can managers who view childcare issues as a burden be changed impress on them the business case for having good childcare strategies in place not least that the organisation will be viewed as an employer of choice particularly by women who though they shouldnt have to be are so grateful for an understanding employer what advice would you give managers looking to devise and implement childcare strategies first conduct a survey of employees needs and then provide fact sheets making it clear what is on offer from the employer and other agencies in response to those needs workplace nurseries childcare vouchers and salary sacrifice schemes are options what can private sector and public sector employers learn from each other on childcare provision there are models of best practice in both the nhs and bt for example generally the public sector is better at being flexible for all staff not just senior managers but some private companies have backup centres that help staff if they are having problems with childcare cover what about the voluntary sector it tends to be more flexible in its worklife balance approach but in all sectors there is a long way to go you were leader of a local authority how important is childcare provision for councillors and people participating in local communities its essential if we are serious about getting more young women participating in local democracy what are your own experiences of childcare when my three children were all under five i was first elected to the council there was no childcare then i relied heavily on my parents now im a granny but two of my children live in the us and the third in another part of england they are all concerned about childcare costs do you

guoqiang lam works eight hours a day in his chinese takeaway business helping in the kitchen and delivering food his wife ying works as the chef she spends two hours every afternoon preparing food and keeps the takeaway open from pm to midnight when their daughter yuetching aged comes home from school they are just getting ready to open the shop yuetching helps with kitchen work and food wrapping it gets busier at the weekends and they work at a faster pace they have no social life to speak of when theyre not working they try to recover from work and catch up on sleep like of the chinese people in britain the couple work long antisocial hours behind the takeaway counter several years ago conscious of their worklife imbalance they moved from glasgow to greater manchester where they bought a takeway business with an apartment over the shop this they hoped would enable them to spend more time with their daughter it didnt as further demands were placed on their time and patience ebbed away the couple found relations between them and yuetching becoming more difficult attitude transformed then guoqiang joined the uks first chinese parenting project run by manchesters chinese community centre also known as wai yin there he began to get a fresh perspective on family issues twoandahalf years later he has become an enthusiastic support worker for the project devoting three hours each week to helping other chinese people cope with their parenting problems his attitudes to have been transformed he admits childrearing is very much the fathers job as well as the mothers some fathers should really change their attitude sylvia sham director of the community centre explains why the takeaway life can cause family problems life is completely cut off from the world outside she says not only language but also the social awareness required for integration cant be learned by a child kept inside the takeaway doors many chinese parents working in takeaways speaking little english themselves only use chinese media they only watch chinese tv channels and videos which means their children use no english at home as a result these children find it difficult to mix in with their peer group outside the confines of the takeaway the perception of takeaways as a ghetto occupation and the chronic problem of being the target of racial abuse and attacks have created two worlds isolation confuses the children while chinese parents like the lams are trying to bring up children within two interacting sociocultural contexts the kids themselves are struggling with two contradicting methods of mentoring one within the takeaway and one at school the longterm inability of the parents to resolve these conflicts has led in a number of cases to poor mental health and many suffer from serious depression the project aims to address these difficulties and has helped chinese parents learn the skills they need to adjust themselves to the british context and to communicate with their children in a suitable way says mei yuk wong the wai yin project coordinator one important aspect is positive discipline we discuss emotional growth and discourage parents from using physical punishment chinese parents who think social services are ignorant of their cultural background find that this fills a gap for instance smacking a child is not an unusual childrearing practice and they are confused when they are labelled child abusers and when their children are taken away by social services guoqiang says through the training and parentsharing we exchange experience and learn how best to educate our children about their cultural and historical origins so they will be able to resolve their identity crisis which is often a result of the lack of minorityculture teaching in mainstream schools we need to learn the way to show our children how to know themselves he believes that the catering families desperately need help and advice but have little access to local services and no one has started to ask why chinese parents dont use them we dont know the language we dont know how to get information about local parenting schemes guoqiang says and when there is such a service they dont know how to deal with chinese parents not knowing anything about our culture and our specific problems despite the needs of the chinese parents home office funding of the project is coming to an end in march frustrating parents and community organisations we are extremely concerned that this will deprive us of our needs and access to services guoqiang says desperate need to provide access to chinese parents the community believes that local authorities should reach out and work with community organisations guoqiang says the priority for some local authorities does not lie with the chinese community organisations because we are believed to be selfsufficient they have this imaginary idea that every chinese is an achiever and were a wealthy community so we dont need parenting help the truth is that were not all rich and happy and we desperately need resources guoqiang has become what he calls a fulltime dad he puts his daughter first and is committed to the parenting project the project has hugely improved my relationship with yuetching he says ive been taking her to the museum to swimming and doing all sorts of things together i used to be very strict with her i used to just shout at her when she did something wrong i used to not allow her to watch any english tv after pm the project has changed my attitude now i always try to explain things to her and she listens now i know how to talk to her i go through her homework with her every day we spend a lot more time together she really trusts me now shes full of ideas about her future and she tells me what she wants to become her ideas do keep changing but its clear that she doesnt want to run a takeaway when she grows up,2006-02,guoqiang lam work eight hour

a law which protects a brutal serial sex attacker who won m in the lottery from compensation claims by his victims will be challenged in the court of appeal today as a denial of human rights a yearold retired teacher who was subjected to a vicious rape attempt by the lottery rapist iorworth hoare years ago will ask three judges to overturn a high court ruling barring her damages claim against him the claim by the woman mrs a is one of three test cases to highlight the strict sixyear time limit for launching compensation claims for deliberate assaults the law commission the official law reform body recommended five years ago that the law should be reformed to prevent further injustices the government has accepted the case for change but has failed to legislate meanwhile thousands of victims of child abuse rape and sexual assault have been told that they brought their cases too late hoare attacked mrs a in broad daylight in a park in leeds in february sentencing him to life imprisonment in mr justice rougier told him for every moment you are at liberty some woman is at risk now hoare has spent most of his life behind bars for rape attempted rape and indecent assault alan newman qc mrs as lawyer told the high court which threw out her case last october that there was something very wrong in the law if his client was not able to claim compensation for hoares attack in the most vicious and disgusting manner he proceeded to sexually assault the claimant it was a most degrading incident and included fairly unspeakable acts on the part of mr hoare he said of her ordeal mrs a did not sue earlier because hoare had no money or property but in august while on weekend leave from leyhill open prison in gloucestershire he won m after buying a lottery ticket he was freed on parole last march mrs a received less than compensation from the criminal injuries compensation scheme and says her main aim in suing hoare is to repay the public purse the appeal court judges headed by the master of the rolls sir anthony clarke will consider mrs as case and two others involving alleged sex abuse by teachers the time limit causes the biggest problems in child abuse cases where it may be many years before victims appreciate the devastating effects the abuse has had on their lives this sixyear time limit for claiming compensation for a deliberate assault starts to run when the act happens or at if the victim is a child it contrasts with a threeyear limit for suing over negligent acts such as road accidents which starts to run when the victim knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim judges have a discretion to extend the threeyear limit but not the sixyear one when parliament set the sixyear limit in the effects of child abuse were little known and it did not occur to legislators that someone could be harmed by a deliberate act but be unaware of the injury done to them among those who have benefited from the current law is the millionaire former businessman william goad dubbed britains worst paedophile who is serving a life sentence for child abuse few of his many victims over years of abuse some as young as eight at the time are likely to see any compensation from the fortune he amassed through a chain of discount stores and indoor markets the association of child abuse lawyers which is campaigning for a change in the law argues that it denies victims the right to a fair trial guaranteed by article of the european convention on human rights current law claims for negligence have to be brought within three years of the date when the victim knew of the injury though a judge can extend this time claims for a deliberate assault have to be brought within six years of the assault this limit is strict and nonextendable if the victim is a child the time starts running from age which means that no victims over can sue their attackers for compensation lawyers acting for abuse victims say the law encourages perpetrators to intimidate victims into keeping quiet in the law commission recommended a threeyear limit running from the date the claimant knew or should reasonably have known the facts about the injury for most types of legal claim with a discretion for the judge to extend it but the recommendation remains unimplemented,2006-02,law protects brutal serial sex attacker lottery compensation claim victim

women are strong characters who can get on with everything they are asked to do without making a huge fuss men in comparison are silly flibbertigibbets who are prone to bouts of fantasy more precisely they are prone to bouts of sexual fantasy it would surprise me if women sit on the tube and think about sex all through the journey like men do they are far too sensible when i was growing up the only woman in my life was my mother i was an only child and spent most of my former years in public school where homosexuality was the only thing on the menu that didnt interest me very much im afraid my first encounter with the female sex was via two wonderfully eccentric lesbian neighbours who dyed their dogs pink and read a lot of exotic novelists like jean cocteau they introduced me to literature as well as to the person with whom i had my first sexual encounter i met the girl at one of their parties when the lesbians caught us kissing they were incensed we were thrown out of the party and onto the common so rather painfully my first sexual encounter was in a field of bracken i have always preferred female company women are more interesting and less predictable than men women and men can be platonic friends but there is an additional element to the relationship something hovering in the atmosphere the two women ive had longterm relationships with both strangely named penelope were far more organised and capable than myself i sat around at home having flights of fancy while their energy put me to shame my current wife penelope is often taking herself off to dive with sharks or to shoot a rabbit she is certainly far more active than most men i know almost all the women i come into contact with are downtoearth and productive and do well in executive jobs their reputation for being unnerved and highly strung is completely unfounded i think men suffer from these characteristics with a far greater intensity and frequency womens levelheaded nature must be because of childbirth now that is certainly the most realistic and painful thing you can go through you cant be a fantasist when you know that pain and blood produces life men drift off into fantasy because they dont have that experience which females do i most admire well definitely not ann widdecombe i admire all the women in parliament who have rejected tony blair like clare short i have huge admiration for muriel spark for her humour and originality i see her about once a year in italy weve also had some fabulous queens elizabeth i and victoria were wonderful they were definitely more grounded than the kings ive noticed womens ability to stay grounded makes them much better criminals and jurors than men from my experience as a barrister male criminals always say that they dont want women on their jury presumably because they know they are good at it women jurors are more rational than their male counterparts they also make better judges as male judges are often in their own world of dreams when it comes to writing female characters i have always found it very easy to slip into a womans skin while working on my last book quite honestly viking i felt far more comfortable writing as the female character lucinda purefoy rather than my male character terry keegan im sure lots of male authors feel more at ease writing female characters look at dh lawrence and ibsen for example shakespeares women are wonderful rosalind in as you like it and portia in the merchant of venice are the best characters in their plays he understood that women are more realistic than men in fact i cant think of anything that men are better at doing than women except having sexual fantasies,2006-02,woman strong character get everything asked without making huge fuss men comparison silly

despite the governments laudable efforts to improve childcare provision many parents with young children continue to face a dilemma does it make more financial sense to stay at home rather than return to work in england there are more than full daycare places at nurseries and with childminders according to the daycare trust the typical fulltime cost for a child under the age of two is and a week respectively that equates to a third of the average gross weekly pay for british workers nursery costs have risen by over the past five years and this was one of the main reasons why rachel wigglesworth decided not return to her parttime job as a charity development worker following the birth of her second child a year ago we didnt have a life says the yearold who lives near cheltenham

as a teacher wigglesworth is setting up her own business as a freelance community and public health consultant ill plan my work to suit me and work around the nursery hours she says the government helps working parents with childcare costs through tax credits and childcare vouchers the maximum childcare element of the working tax credit is capped at a week for one child and for two or more children however the average working parent pays threequarters of childcare costs the government has spent bn on childcare reform over nine years with tangible results one in four children have access to a childcare place compared with one in seven in but with of mothers with a child aged under five now in employment fulltime professional childcare is an option only for a minority the most common type of childcare used by families with working mothers is close relatives says mike brewer at the institute for fiscal studies childminders are used by a small number of working parents while nannies are used by an even smaller proportion the complexities of childcare provision in britain mean there is no set income threshold that can tell parents whether they are better off financially by working

the way we parent our children is undergoing a rapid and profound transformation where once mothers did virtually all the caring today there is greater sharing of that task by dads typically where a mother is working outside the home fathers now do a third of parental childcare an eightfold increase in a generation for fathers of preschool children according to the equal opportunities commission this revolution from oneparent to twoparent care in the uk is a direct consequence of women taking a greater role in the workplace and the falling away of gendered roles in our society these changes can bring great benefits where fathers and mothers are both doing a good job with them children are more likely to excel at school stay out of trouble and grow into balanced welladjusted adults care from both parents also helps girls and boys to question gender stereotypes that so limit what they think they can do in terms for example of future careers these social changes pose important questions if fathers are now looking after children including small babies for lengthy periods of time fathers need the same skills and knowledge that we have traditionally expected mothers to have and this means services which support parents should be geared up to supporting fathers as well as mothers these changes also challenge family support services that have in the past typically assumed that when it comes to children its one parent only mum that they should be focusing on the task now for these family services is to modernise to support other significant carers in the family notably fathers who have or want to have a more active role in daytoday care of their children we should not however underestimate how difficult this task can be thinking generically about parents will not be enough we must think distinctively about reaching fathers men are typically not accustomed to using many of these services and may lack confidence in coming forward when they do they may find themselves in environments that feel perfectly normal to women but which may unconsciously suggest to men that these are places for mothers not fathers we need to do much more to encourage fathers to feel at ease and welcome such creative thinking has been pioneered in a number of sure starts for example the awardwinning daddy cool programme at a sure start in southampton has developed saturday morning breakfasts for male carers and their children it has a special magazine for fathers visits fathers and their children at home runs a weekly fiveaside game for them as well as other activities the result is a large increase in the number of dads at the centre learning about childcare first aid debt management and a host of other issues vital to the lives of their children successes at this and other similar sure starts lie behind the practice guidance the government issued last november for its new flagship childrens centres the guidance makes clear the need to think carefully about ensuring that services are fatherfriendly the message from the government is clear for the best interests of our children public services need to think afresh to ensure that dads are supported

theres an advert emblazoned on the sides of doubledecker buses for a computer game paste your girlfriends white bits here another irritating sexualisation of public space another insistent insidious message of how culture shapes expectations of our sexuality another reminder of ones own powerlessness to assert other images of sexuality with anything like comparable prominence imagine could i have an equivalent number of double deckers trumpeting the message that sex is the magical experience of mutual giving boring duh the problem about our pervasive cultural sexism is that the debate is tilted all one way pornography is colonising all other forms of media occasionally a brave voice such as that of the new york magazine writer ariel levy speaks out but despite the force of her arguments a multimillionpound industry will carry on churning out the websites dvds and magazines that are distorting our sexual mores they may recruit a naive cheerleader such as kate taylor on these pages last week but shes only a token this phenomenon is driven by the market while the cash rolls in millions of lives are muddled sometimes even ruined by the multiple misconceptions being peddled men and women plot their way with bitter bravado through a minefield of sexual mores that bear little relation to their own desire for sexual fulfilment they recount the mismatched expectations the lack of romanticism and the huge quantities of alcohol required to mask the selfdoubt peer pressure engineers a culture of sexual availability men no longer need to seduce women theyve outsourced that role to a media culture while womens capacity to consent has been culturally massaged long before they ever get near the bed the rise of raunch the explicit flaunting of ones sexuality is all about how weve been persuaded to market ourselves to advertise our desirability the latter is no longer a process of conscious and playful revelation but must be in yer face im sexy geddit its as boring as preferring to eat slabs of meat off a chopping board than a plate of pleasingly arranged deliciously cooked food another of the many concepts of the market that have infiltrated intimacy is an instrumentalism i get this need met in return for meeting her need on that when people talk honestly about their relationships you can often hear the totting up of an emotional account at its crudest there is no responsibility to the other person beyond the striking of the deal that instrumentalism absolves the individual from any wider consideration of their lovers wellbeing the only responsibility is to pop the question and register the oneword answer yes or no it is a very thin concept of consent so a woman can defend her decision to sleep with a man she knows to be deeply in love with her because shes feeling lonely and wants a bit of sex on the grounds that he consented he knew the deal hes left feeling heartbroken and abused she has exploited his emotional vulnerability the inadequacy of this truncated responsibility was made clear in the collapse of a rape trial in swansea last november because drunken consent is still consent arent the ethics of all intimate relationships especially sexual ones based on responseibility you cant divorce responding to a person which sex is from responsibility for the lovers wellbeing as well as your own there are other metaphors of the market distorting our behaviour the compulsion to compete and excel is now as true of the bed as the office or the housing market weve deregulated the market in intimacy over the last or so years as the taboos and inhibitions have been dismantled so the pressure to sexually perform has emerged can you provide the best orgasms ever looking ahead one can see how the proliferation of virtual reality will only multiply current confusion as porn technology becomes ever more sophisticated the boundary between relationships with real people and fantasy creatures will become increasingly blurred hence the sense of foreboding prompted by the aforementioned bus advert in the future we may look back on loaded with a degree of nostalgia twodimensional pictures a more contained experience than the smells physical sensations and images pumped out of a computer virtual realitys fantasy is control how will that further confuse the capacity of a yearold to decipher consent the intriguing question is why we have been susceptible to this reconfiguration of our sexuality in line with market principles the answer is that weve been seduced by a dream of sexual liberation but what weve ended up with is a tatty cardboardcutout version perhaps the people who are the most promiscuous are the least liberated the least likely to have a purchase on the total abandonment of sexual pleasure theres been no golden age when people succeeded in matching their desire for sexual pleasure with their needs for emotional fulfilment and security this has probably been the arena of human relationships most riven with conflicting and contradictory irrationality throughout history just dont make the false assumption that we are more liberated than previous

the equal opportunities commission is scrapping plans to test new spot checks to identify unequal pay for women after its funding was cut the equality watchdog is having to scale back its work from april after it was informed this week that it has lost from its m budget the cuts raise doubts about the commissions ability to help local authorities hospitals and schools meet new legal duties to tackle the pay gap between men and women campaigners last night called it a scandal which further shortchanged women the gap between men and women is currently for full time staff and for part time last month the woman and work commission failed to agree on whether to recommend equality reviews of payrolls to identify pay gaps something campaigners believe is the route to exposing the extent of unequal pay instead they asked the eoc to pilot a lighter touch equality check of employers but this work will now be dropped altogether as the eoc said it required extra funding to do it also at question is whether it will be able to take on new responsibilities for implementing and enforcing a legal duty from next year for public sector employers to tackle sexism in the workplace sources close to the eoc said we are shocked and concerned this is much worse than expected and at such an important time for gender equality with new laws and the women and work commission to implement there

three decades ago one out of three rape attacks reported to the police ended in conviction today it is just one in worse still the variation between police force areas is huge some of reported rapes in northamptonshire end in conviction fewer than in gloucestershire even margaret thatcher no fan of equality believed there should be equality before the law but in england there is a fourteenfold variation in the chances of conviction this is a postcode lottery just as serious as the one over medical treatment thanks to the fawcett commission on women and criminal justice which produced its annual audit of its justice and equality proposals yesterday the shocking statistic is getting better known why has the conviction rate dropped so dramatically it is a convoluted story made more complicated by improvements that have been made in both police and court procedure some police forces have introduced special rape teams take rape training seriously and made available suites where victims can be interviewed judges are less likely to allow intrusive or overaggressive questions by defence teams there are more rape crisis centres sexual assault referral centres witness care units the law has been tightened yet the conviction rate has continued to drop remorselessly in the latest statistics only four out of forces had rape conviction rates of more than there has been a large increase in reported rapes from in to in but even with this number the british crime survey suggests another go unreported yet of the that are reported some twothirds never get to court onethird because victims decide they do not want to go ahead with what they regard as a traumatic process and onethird because the prosecution believes the case will not stand up even then only of those that go to trial end in conviction one reason for the latter result could be prejudices of juries a survey by amnesty international carried out late last year as part of its stop violence against women campaign found one third of british people believed a women was partially or completely responsible for being raped if she had behaved flirtatiously as the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald noted this was shocking what the latest fawcett report shows is that until now reforms within the different arms of the criminaljustice system have been too piecemeal only of the police forces in england and wales had dedicated rape investigation teams the number of sexual assault referral centres where victims can receive counselling medical examination and not be forced to report their attack to the police has only risen from three to in the last three years but there are signs that momentum is picking up ministers are exploring whether to provide more protection to women who are raped when drunk onethird of rape attacks on women happen after they have been drinking currently the law only presumes there has been no consent when a woman is asleep unconscious or her drink has been spiked a consultation document in proposed it should include women who were drunk but this was vetoed by david blunkett it is now being revived so is the idea of expert witnesses used in australia and canada who can explain to juries the different responses women have to rape and why some delay reporting attacks what is missing is the sense of urgency under a act courts could have been using the videos of interviews given by rape victims when they first go to the police so that the jury can see how traumatised the victim was and have a better understanding of the enormity of the allegations but the section has not been introduced because of a shortage of transcribers courts need transcripts the plan was refloated this week as though it was a new idea it is not what it

is anyone else sick and tired of hearing announcement after announcement from the home office about new changes in the law to improve the numbers of rape convictions today the news is full of how new measures will improve the dire conviction rate in reported rape cases less than in the last years we have had several promises that yet another tweak or minor alteration in the way the rape law is framed will mean more women will come forward and report the crime and more rapists will be slammed in choky well it has just not happened in there was a major kerfuffle over defendants in sexual assault and rape trials defending themselves do you remember the ralston edwards case it was horrible for the victim she was made to endure six days of her rapist who was eventually convicted grilling her about the clothes he was wearing what he smelt like etc in a clever ruse to make her relive her attack and therefore break down in the witness box as a result of this case and one or two similar ones the media have latched on to the government called for a ban on defendants in sex crime cases representing themselves this was supposed to be a milestone that would result in a sea change for victims enduring the hostility of a rape trial i was dead against the proposed change that may sound odd as i am known to be an outspoken campaigner against the complacency surrounding sexual violence against women but i knew that a only a handful of rapists defend themselves and yet barristers defending rapists are allowed to use the most hideous methods raking the complainant through the alleged sexual mud of her past and thus putting far more women off going to trial b in all known cases where men have defended themselves they have been convicted which is a good thing and finally c no exceptions in law should be made aside from the anonymity for complainants when dealing with sex crime cases or the human rights boys will start shouting unfair and the rest of society will get them impression that convicting a rapist is impossible unless exceptional methods are used in court since there have been several more proposed and actual changes none of which has made any difference to the conviction rate which continues to fall all of these however have been presented as radical and cutting edge one that continues to be touted is the introduction of a twotiered system for date and stranger rape making rape by a man known to the victim less serious than cases in which a hooded madman leaps out from behind a bush in new legislation was introduced making it more difficult for defence lawyers to grill complainants about their previous sexual history the government bragged and swanked about how this would be the change that ensured the odd rapist did actually get convicted the result it has not worked because it has been left to the judges discretion and guess what he usually allows such evidence to be presented because of the potential challenges under the human rights act and because he is persuaded that it has some relevance to the case women and children are still asked in court what underwear they had on and whether they have had abortions or been promiscuous i have been in court and heard these questions as have colleagues of mine the introduction of special measures where particularly vulnerable victims of sex crimes could opt to give evidence behind a screen or via video link was the next intervention in the law obviously those on witness protection programmes or children desperately need this protection but there is anecdotal evidence that jurors hate not being able to see the complainant give evidence as they find it difficult to empathise again this shift made no difference to the number of convictions then in it was the change in the definition of consent that was supposed to result in an increase in convictions because it would mean a man could not get away with rape if he had been reckless as to whether or not the woman had consented to sex the uselessness of this change in the law was highlighted by the case last year of the acquittal of the swansea student who had sex with a comatose woman on the floor of the halls of residence so now mike obrien is on the tv saying that the law of consent should be clarified so that the swansea case is not repeated but the definition of consent was supposed to have been clarified in the sexual offences act why are we going through it all again because despite all the changes i have mentioned the one that could make all the difference is not forthcoming and we are going round in circles clutching at legislative straws no change in the law will make any difference to rape convictions until men are taught that rape will result in prison and at the moment they know that it is unlikely that they will be convicted if they rape someone they know however slightly they may know them there is no point in appealing to their better judgment as rapists are unlikely to have much of a conscience they need to know they will lose something major the love of their family their jobs and their freedom if they commit rape this means that we have to stop making excuses for men who commit these crimes or we may as well give up now and decriminalise rape stop perpetuating the idea that young women out on the lash and dressed in next to nothing are asking for it no one asks to be forced to take a penis in her mouth vagina or anus by one of more men alcohol is being paraded as the new short skirt lets stop putting the onus on women and look more closely at mens disgusting behaviour when out boozing with their mates and looking to score it would help if the prosecutors in rape trials did their jobs as carefully and vigorously as defence lawyers i have seen shoddy work from the cps including falling asleep during the trial and on one occasion laughing with the defence about the underwear a yearold complainant had been wearing when attacked alok jha writing in todays comment pages is right unless we challenge the messages in lads mags and popular culture in general which depicts women as sexually available objects constantly gagging for a shag we will get nowhere young men today are led to believe that men are led on by slags acting provocatively and that these men cannot control themselves when confronted with a combination of alcohol and female flesh these messages suggest depressingly that all men really are potential rapists feminists did not proclaim that men who cannot keep it zipped up and their apologists did until we begin to unpick and destroy the myths about sexual assault and start to hold men and not women accountable for rape no change in the law will make the slightest bit of difference,2006-03,anyone else sick tired hearing

the number of rapes reported to police that end in a conviction depends on a postcode lottery which sees convictions fluctuating between and depending on where you live the home office figures for were released yesterday as ministers put forward a package of reforms aimed at boosting the plummeting conviction rate for rape now at an alltime low of of crimes reported in england and wales the figures show that just of rapes reported to police in gloucestershire end in a conviction compared with in northamptonshire as part of the reforms videotaped interviews by police with rape victims possibly conducted within hours of the offence will routinely be shown to juries in an attempt to secure more convictions at present videotapes of interviews with child sex assault victims can be shown in court as a substitute for the childs evidenceinchief questioning by the prosecution counsel but while the law was changed in to allow the same treatment for adult rape victims implementation has been held up by a shortage of resources for transcribing the tapes ministers said they hoped to bring the measure into operation within months the reforms would also allow expert witnesses such as psychologists to testify to dispel myths about how genuine victims behave after rape this would include explanations about why victims often delay reporting a rape blame themselves and have incomplete or inconsistent memories of the event another proposal is for new legislation to define when someone is capable of consenting to sex to clarify when drunkenness makes a person incapable this follows a case at swansea crown court which was dropped by the prosecution midway through on the basis that drunken consent is still consent ministers argue that a decision on whether a woman is too drunk to be capable of consenting should be left to the jury mike obrien the solicitor general said he hoped the reforms would help to reverse an unacceptable drop in conviction rates which now sees only one in every rapes reported to police ending in a conviction rape conviction rates have dropped steadily from of reported cases in to only in the percentage of rapists brought to justice is much lower because only about of rapes are thought to come to the attention of the police mr obrien said the key problem on conviction of rape cases is that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt we do not intend to change that what we can do is improve the way the prosecution get the best evidence before the jury the fawcett societys commission on women and the criminal justice system will launch a report today calling on the government to adopt an integrated strategy to tackle all forms of violence against women it highlights the rape postcode lottery and unequal access around the

the government is proposing to shake up the way rape trials are conducted in a bid to boost the number of convictions the solicitor general mike obrien said that while the number of complaints of rape had risen sharply convictions had only increased slightly speaking on the bbc radio today programme he said an awful lot of people who are committing rapes are getting away with it the proposed changes are contained in a consultation document aimed at increasing the conviction rate last year rapes were reported but only one in resulted in a conviction the home office minister fiona mctaggart said there is clear evidence that the mismatch between convictions and reports suggests there are people who have raped who dont get convicted one of the proposed changes is to make video interviews with rape victims automatically admissible in all cases currently they are only allowed when the victim is under these recordings which are often made within hours of the alleged offence might give juries a more detailed and accurate account of victims experiences the consultation document said i am trying to give juries the best possible evidence available if that evidence is the interview given to the police shortly after reporting the rape then the jury should be able to see that said mr obrien another proposal is to allow experts to give evidence about an alleged rape victims general behaviour after the attack this would bring the uk more in line with the way rape trials are conducted in the us canada and australia the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald said last year he was in favour of introducing expert witnesses to the courtroom to challenge the myths about victims behaviour for example jurors often find it difficult to understand why battered wives return to their abusers and fail to grasp why a victim might not report a rape for many weeks or months such apparently puzzling behaviour is often used by the defence as a basis for questioning in order to make victims appear unreliable or untruthful the government would also like to redefine the law on when a person consents to sex particularly if drugs or alcohol have been consumed what we need to do is make sure that where alcohol has been consumed and it affected the capacity of the victim then that matter should be put before the jury said mr obrien he pointed to a number of cases where judges had decided that a rape case should not be put before a jury because the alleged victim had been intoxicated and her evidence was hazy that is she could not say with absolute certainty that she did not consent,2006-03,government proposing shake way rape trial conducted bid boost number conviction solicitor general mike obrien said number complaint rape risen sharply conviction increased slightly

naomi eisenstadt has kept her new york twang and with it her nononsense practicality despite years living and working in the uk back in the days when she was working on early years projects running nurseries and employing people she says potential childminders always lost the chance of a job if they said they loved children children are individuals she explains some you like some you dont eisenstadt might not like every child but she has spent her entire professional career caring for them one way or the other first in early years settings then academic through the voluntary sector and eventually at the heart of this governments early years reforms up until february she was responsible for sure start the governments flagship scheme to provide family support services in britains poorest areas now she is chief adviser on childrens services to the education secretary ruth kelly eisenstadt is clearly thrilled at the prospect and smiles broadly as she describes what the job involves whereas before she was responsible for implementing policy and making it work on the ground her job now is to draw on her experience and come up with ideas about how things should work with childrens services at something of a crossroads theres plenty of demand for bright new ideas and shes faithful to the agenda in place that she must build on she dismisses any notion that the integration of education social services and other childrens services isnt working indeed she warns that shes fierce to those who question whether they should come together at all much of the structural change for integrating childrens services and education at a local authority level has been done for example she says that out of local authorities have a director of childrens services in place we have been very successful in creating the conditions for integration she says my job now is to work out how that translates into frontroom services its the nittygritty of making sure children are safe happy and thriving that eisenstadt has been asked to work out she compares it to the grassroots work in education about how teachers teach and how children learn in wider childrens services there is still much to be worked out about how families should be supported what works and what doesnt so whats the ideal arrangement the dream scenario is about making the services we currently have much more sensitive to the holistic needs of families she says the classic one is safeguarding so that any professional if they have any concerns at all should be able to know what to do and who to call if a child is at risk my dream scenario is to get that in place perfectly and then to widen it to the things people pick up on in their daily interactions holistic approach if a pregnant woman is visiting the midwife with her fouryearold son and in the course of the conversation it transpires that the son has a different father i would want the midwife to be able to say to that woman how are they getting on just that question might alert them to a problem that could get them some help its a holistic approach rather than just thinking about the bump eisenstadt is well aware of the public interest in childhood and parenting take the issue of childcare where she is frustrated by the debate about the extent to which too much childcare might be damaging for young children yes there is consistent evidence that fulltime care under the age of two has a small impact on the development of a small number of children she says we cannot ignore that because those children even small in number will be harder to manage in later life but i think that it has been greatly exaggerated if you look at the vast majority of working women they are middleclass women who are choosing to go back to work and if they make that choice we accept that and its our responsibility to make sure that childcare is as good as it possibly can be indeed there are benefits other than financial to having working parents a headteacher said to me once that the parents get a job and the children come to school on time theres a routine in the family the debate is too dominated by middleclass worries she says when the real work to be done is with poorer families you have to look at the effects of free school meals on school outcomes if you look at what it means to be poor and the impact of that it is massively greater than any effect of childcare eisenstadt must face some immediately apparent issues on childrens services one is sorting out how different agencies share information about children its about parents not having to give their address six times or having to tell the difficult birth story six times she says another is about changing the way parents are talked to she shares childrens minister beverley hughess concern that fathers are not being brought into the discussion about families we want to work with fathers not for ideological reasons but because the evidence shows that working with fathers does make a difference for their children she says eisenstadts theories will surely inform her new job there has been a tendency she believes for childrens services to focus on families needs rather than what works for children and sometimes they have focused too much on what parents want that brings us on to sure start which eisenstadt was in charge of for seven years until february three months after an evaluation of the scheme gave a less than glowing report it argued that the bn programme though successful in some areas had failed to significantly boost childrens development language and behaviour children of teenage mothers did worse in sure start areas than elsewhere she issues a frank assessment on what limited the scheme my reflection on sure start is that we did really well on joining up services on getting services into the poorest communities and we did pretty well on services that respond to what parents want you go to these places and its pretty hard not to feel that these are exciting successful places but we failed on two things the balance between whats good for children and what parents want now were doing more on that we also fell down on reach the idea that we reach every family in the poorest areas and not just those that came forward but they were in the right locations she insists she digs out statistics on average incomes in sure start areas a week the poverty line is currently calculated at a week community level she thinks back to the experience of working on these schemes at the community level you do an enormous amount of work to get people in and its very very busy and its very very difficult then to think again about those who didnt come thats what were focusing on now and she insists the evaluation is part of the process its a lot of public money working in very poor communities how do we make it better you cant spend all that public money without evaluating it and bending it as you go we started something very radical and very new and the whole point is to learn about it we have a whole new system for nought to five year olds and we have to make sure we learn the lessons of this very large pilot but if services are too much about parents needs and not about their children doesnt the state run the risk of overruling parents wishes by putting their childrens first its the ageold argument about the nanny state and eisenstadt is having none of it it is not about eitheror she insists you need to ensure you are meeting what parents want and that is why we are improving the choice of

prosecutors in date rape cases will be freed to call expert witnesses on the trauma of sex crimes to shatter juries misconceptions about the crime under plans to boost convictions to be unveiled this week victims who delay reporting the alleged attack or appear unusually composed in the witness box should no longer be treated with suspicion the consultation paper from the solicitor general mike obrien will argue the witnesses could describe how a traumatised victim might require time to raise the courage to go to police why she might have stayed with an abusive partner factors that might lead a jury to doubt her story or the ways in which she might respond to giving evidence the law on consent will also be clarified to protect women who are too drunk to be capable of consenting to sex putting the onus back on the defence to prove that a woman who was incapable through alcohol was actually a willing partner video testimony from womens interviews with police in the immediate aftermath of a rape when they are likely to have been most distressed could also be permitted in courts the changes will affect all rape cases but will be most relevant to socalled date rapes where the attacker was known to the victim and where juries have proved more reluctant to convict than rapes committed by strangers rape is an appalling crime that devastates the lives of victims and their families the conviction rate is too low and we need to do something about it said a source close to the solicitor general the consultation paper forms part of a concerted effort by ministers this week to show they take violence against women seriously after damaging leaks of plans by the independent sentencing advisory council to reduce rape sentences junior home office minister fiona mactaggart will announce plans to protect prostitutes from violent clients while her colleague baroness scotland will unveil plans for advisers to help victims of domestic and sexual violence through court only one in rape allegations ends in a guilty verdict acquaintance rapes are the most common but most difficult to prosecute while even in stranger rape cases perceptions of the victim have proved crucial to the trial and sentencing the expert witnesses would not testify specifically about the victims mental state but would present general evidence on the psychology of sexattack victims they could also tackle common assumptions such as that a scantily clad woman must have been asking for it or to blame the paper will also call for either a change in the law or new guidance for judges on cases where the victim is drunk or high on drugs,2006-03,prosecutor date rape case freed call expert witness trauma sex crime shatter jury misconception crime plan boost conviction unveiled week victim delay

setting aside the rank commercialisation of yet another religious festival tomorrow is a day for reflecting on the value of motherhood but if that sounds as saccharine as the preprinted wording of a mothers day card how does a year sound that is how much it would cost to contract out all the household jobs that the average mum does without any pecuniary reward the average fathers contribution on the other hand is measured at just the difference between sexes boils down to who does what in the home mothers are reckoned to spend hours a week on household jobs including hours of childcare while fathers spend hours including hours with the children women also do significantly more cooking housekeeping family shopping and taxiing the kids around it would cost the average family a week to pay someone else to do a mothers job with childcare being the biggest weekly outlay at followed by housekeeping at in london the total cost is more than a week mothers with fulltime jobs outside the home spend more time on domestic and family chores than they do in their paid place of work more than hours a week on average the total for fulltime mothers at home is hours and to contract out their unpaid duties would cost a year each these figures which appear in the insurer legal amp generals latest value of a mum survey highlight the expense of raising children and the often unseen value of parenthood they also prove that traditional gender roles still exist in the home despite the record level of economic activity among mothers but could the division of parental duties also explain the pay gap between men and women the average hourly pay of working mums with dependent children is a third less than that of working fathers according to a department for work and pensions dwp report published in january before they have children women earn just less than men working women experience particularly low wage growth in the two or three years after each birth whereas this is the period when their male colleagues experience particularly high wage growth says mike brewer coauthor of the dwp report the pay difference doesnt start to shrink until years after each birth but it never disappears entirely brewers report offers no reasons why hourly pay is so different from our data we cannot say there is discrimination against mothers on the other hand some mothers are able to escape the pay penalty more than others particularly women in the public sector he says but it could be that women with children have less power in the labour market and are forced to accept lower wages for the kind of work that is more family friendly women returning to work after starting a family also face greater discrimination than disabled people according to research by professor richard berthoud of the institute for economic research at the university of essex mothers of children under the age of whether with or without a partner are less likely to have a job than a man with a partner he says discrimination against motherhood continues despite years of equal opportunities legislation for example a womans right to return to her old job after maternity leave or a job of the equivalent value is now protected by law however a lot of women find that on returning to work they have been effectively demoted says rob holdsworth at the equal opportunities commission eoc during their maternity leave they have been passed over for promotion and pay rises in a survey last november the recruitment and employment confederation found of recruitment agencies had been asked by employers not to hire women who were pregnant or of childbearing age despite this being illegal almost half of pregnant women suffer unfair treatment at work according to the eoc britain is the only eu state where workers can opt out of the working time directive the tuc believes that scrapping the optout and making all jobs workable parttime could bring greater equality for mothers rebecca gill at the tuc says enabling men to leave work and spend time with their children will enable women to work more and thereby reduce the employment penalty that motherhood brings but if men are to take a more active part in home life they also need to change their attitudes towards work men tend not to factor parenthood into their careers and still see themselves as breadwinners tomorrows celebration of motherhood might be a chance for dads to reflect on their roles too the fulltime mother i absolutely made the right decision bridget gilchrist who lives in south london with her husband justin and three children beth daniel and jessie worked for a middle east information group in parliament for more than a dozen years she left the world of westminster to be a fulltime mother in i took six months maternity leave for each of my children but with my first beth i went back to working am to pm four days a week later on i decreased my working week to three days then to two days on a job share ive used a whole range of childcare options from childminders to shared nannies to au pairs childcare generally accounted for half of what i earned ive always done the lions share of household jobs even when i was working four days a week but justin has done the lions share of keeping the household finances going ive had help from au pairs in the past but now i do of the household chores my decision to be a fulltime mother was partly financial as we could afford for me to stop but mainly i felt that all my children needed me to be with them much more than i had been and i can see now that it is absolutely the right decision before i was constantly rushing from one thing to the next and never taking time to think what i needed to do our son has special needs and we had him at home for four years doing a home teaching programme it required an enormous amount of research and preparation the acquisition of new skills on our part and consistency although he now goes to school fulltime there is a large element of that still i do miss work and the status it brings my colleagues were surprised when i decided to leave because it came quite late on in my career but because im a little bit older i have less to prove and im clearer about what is important when i was younger i thought that i had to be campaigning and that this was the most important thing in the world i handed my first child over to a childminder when she was five months without a blink but i wouldnt be able to do that now my priorities changed and while i loved my work and the world of politics ive made the right decision and been very fortunate to be able to do so,2006-03,setting aside rank commercialisation yet another religious festival tomorrow day reflecting value motherhood sound saccharine

the coverage of sex discrimination cases has such a standard template that it is hard to believe that articles like these are written by human beings rather than being produced by a keyboard macro there are three ingredients to such a story a wellgroomed woman a salacious anecdote and a huge sum of money you have a choice of two flavours of article of course if one is writing for a leftwing newspaper or for the womens section the story is isnt it terrible that these highly paid bankers did these terrible things to this reasonably attractive woman if one is writing for a rightwing newspaper or for the business section the story is isnt this a huge amount of money that this reasonably attractive woman is getting for this fairly minor slight not optional of course is a big colour picture of the plaintiff usually showing a fair amount of leg to get over the fact that this is a sex discrimination story but usually showing little or no cleavage to emphasis that is is a sex discrimination story the facts of these cases as presented are always here is a woman she had her bum pinched or her breasts commented on or whatever and now she is suing her employers for several million pounds which is why win or lose the plaintiffs in these cases always end up being the object of uncomprehending jealousy most people have a fairly major problem in understanding why someone should get more compensation for being jokingly invited to a lapdancing club or asked to give someone a shoulder massage than one typically gets for having a leg chopped off and inevitably the end result is articles like this one saying that it looks really bad for the sisterhood if women are such crybabies and who will want to employ them if a simple comment can land the firm with a sevenfigure settlement the facts in the newspaper are not the facts let me explain every year in the big banks there is something called a bonus round during this period some people are given large sums of money some people are given significantly smaller sums of money and some people are given nothing at all just to clarify here when i say large sums of money i mean between a quarter of a million and a million pounds and yes thank you i am aware how that compares to a nurses salary its called capitalism and it doesnt look like its going anywhere any time soon so can we get on with this blog post please the people in the significantly smaller and nothing at all bonus groups are usually unhappy about the fact if someone thinks that they have been unfairly screwed on their bonus because they are a woman what are they going to do except sue having made the decision to sue the case usually falls into the hands of a specialist lawyer the lawyer will typically want to settle the case out of court for a large sum of money and a quick turnover the way that you persuade people to settle out of court is to convince them that a whole load of bad and embarrassing publicity will come out for them if they dont settle soon hence the client is asked to dredge through her memory for bad behaviour that will look really awful in the cold light of day or in the newspapers boys being boys it is unlikely that there will be a shortage of material because sex discrimination stories are written according to the template the bad publicity does indeed arrive if the case isnt settled promptly and so the case gets settled or maybe it goes to trial i have no specific information about the merits of any of these cases but the fact is that if the case is about sixfigure bonuses and the plaintiff reckons shes been done out of of them then the settlement is going to be a sevenfigure sum the actual case and certainly the settlement has nothing to do with the pinching poking and stripping and everything to do with the allegation of unfairness over bonuses but the world is allowed to believe that in the modern financial sector comparing someone to pamela anderson is a crime on a par with multiple murder to be met with financial settlements on the scale of a footballers divorce i can quite understand why these cases are in general covered so badly no editor on earth is going to print a story about the rights and wrongs of who got given the credit for the xyz deal and who got screwed when there is the alternative of writing a mildly salacious one about dirty old men and strip clubs i have sat in enough wine bars with colleagues male and female to know that there is nothing on earth duller than a bitter story about the unfairness of a particular banks bonus regime but perhaps from time to time the readers could at least have it suggested to them that there is a little bit more to it than that,2006-03,coverage sex discrimination case ha standard template hard

committed to closing the gender pay gap but his solution is unimaginative and misguided increasing training for women to get them out of lowpaid professions as recommended by the recent women and work

grasp if there is equal pay between women and men it will boost earnings and strengthen the economy in an immediately constructive effective way the women and work commission found that the uks gender pay gap the worst in europe costs the british economy a staggering bn a year in lost productivity and wasted talent and yet we are told that at the current rate it will take more than years to close the fulltime pay gap and about years to end the parttime pay gap brown needs to wholeheartedly tackle all three of the main causes of the gender pay gap occupational segregation workplace discrimination and the limitations women face in our long hours culture because of their greater responsibilities at home rather than just tiptoeing around training for women with low skills if he wants a stronger more productive economy the chancellor urgently needs to address this inequality which costs the uk so dearly as the equal opportunities commissions polling reveals support from

social progress often comes at a price and the emancipation of women is no exception it is the mark of a confident successful liberal society that it can acknowledge and face up to the negative consequences of social advance and put in place appropriate policies to mitigate them whether it is the loosening of social solidarity as a result of growing diversity or the question of how to replace the female altruism that has been central to caring for the young and the old as women spend more time at work politics can come up with solutions but first the problem has to be acknowledged in the case of the negative consequences of female emancipation it is rare to find a hardheaded evaluation of the losses to society when women especially educated ones choose work over family the newspapers are so full of stories about pay gaps and glass ceilings that sometimes they miss the bigger and still remarkably recent story that for the first time in history women in developed societies have no career or occupation barred to them politicians journalists and business people often stress the negative effects of losing half the countrys best brains to the kitchen sink and of course they are right to do so the feminisation of the labour market especially at the higher professional end has brought enormous benefits but it is striking how seldom anyone mentions let alone tries to quantify the offsetting losses when women choose work over family one of the reasons the female labour market story has appeared so unambiguously positive over recent decades is the buried assumption that women were not really doing anything of value when they were working mainly in the home the american economist shirley burggraf has noted the strange alliance on this issue between feminists and market economists the former see domestic labour as performed under patriarchal duress the latter do not consider labour in the home at all because it is not paid and so does not contribute to gdp according to alison wolf writing on this theme in the latest issue of prospect magazine it is simply stupid not to carefully analyse the losses from emancipation wolf is herself a professor at an elite university so is hardly suggesting that the great advances in equality of the past years should be rolled back but she does point to three negative consequences of the advance of educated women first and most familiar is the impact of employment change on childbearing we all know about the prospect of demographic decline yet we ignore sometimes wilfully the extent to which educated women face disincentives to bear children second is the death of sisterhood in the past women of all classes in all societies shared lives centred on explicitly female concerns today women divide into two groups a minority of welleducated women have careers around which family life is built and they suffer little if any disadvantage at work associated with being a woman a majority do jobs usually part time in order to bring in some extra money to the family which remains their main priority third mentioned above is the erosion of female altruism the service ethos usually underpinned by religious belief which has been profoundly important to modern industrial societies particularly in the education of their young and the care of their old and sick the erosion of this service ethos combined with the opening up of much greater opportunity for women in business and the professions has also had a negative impact on the public services and the voluntary sector for years from the s to the s the public services above all education and healthcare attracted the most able and energetic women of every generation they had nowhere else to go now they do we cannot and do not want to go back but we have to acknowledge these losses before we can do anything about them,2006-03,social progress often come price emancipation woman exception mark confident successful

use their sexuality to get ahead i dont know if this is a pr campaign to get men to finally pay attention to the cause but its certainly stirring up trouble it all kicked off with the publication of female chauvinist pigs a rant against raunch culture by the new york magazine writer ariel levy in the book she argues that the recent trend for softporn styling in everything from music videos to popular tv is reducing female sexuality to its basest levels in short a tawdry tarty cartoonlike version of female sexuality has become so ubiquitous it no longer seems particular which is all fair enough until levy starts to list the ways in which todays women are allowing their sexuality to be sold short thongs for example crop tops lapdancing classes maxim and fhm playboy tshirts the word chick levy thinks raunch culture is a feminist movement gone terribly wrong we are in her eyes doing all these things merely to show the men that we are one of the guys and liberated and rebellious naturally she finds this confusing why is labouring to look like pamela anderson empowering the answer is labouring to look like pamela anderson is not empowering were not trying to be empowered the twentysomething women i know dont care about oldstyle feminism partly this is because they already see themselves as equal to men they can work they can vote they can bonk on the first date for younger women raunch is not about feminism its just about fashion another reason for the rise of raunch is that women are rediscovering the joy of being loved for their bodies not just their minds today sexes mix a lot more than they used to so boys grow up having girls as friends they tend to listen to what women have to say and when they marry they dont consider sharing the housework to be castrating instead of desperately longing for the right to be seen as human beings todays girls are playing with the oldfashioned notion of being seen as sex objects this is not terrible news in fact to me this is the ultimate feminist ideal which levy would realise if she stopped shouting at mtv for a moment and thought about it she proclaims that boob jobs and crop tops dont bring us any closer to the fundamental feminist project of allowing every woman to be her own specific self but what if a womans own specific self is a thongwearing playboytshirted specific self who thinks lapdancing is a laugh and likes getting wolfwhistled at by builders what if a woman spends hours in the gym to create a body she is proud of is that a waste of time time she should have spent in a university library no levy is not alone in raging against raunch the f word a british feminist website last month launched a tirade against lads magazines such as loaded zoo and nuts they relentlessly promote the message that women exist solely for the sexual gratification of men and boys argued rachel bell by internalising this onedimensional male construct of sexuality both sexes are losing out but it is girls and women who will pay the heavier price ive worked for gq and the sun and in neither place did i see women being exploited does bell have any idea how much money women make when they take their clothes off how much freedom and independence these girls can earn in an hour abi titmuss and the new breed of totty generally own the copyright to their naughtiest photos so with each publication they rake it in look at lads mags from a different perspective and you see that whats being exploited are mens sexual responses to give money to women it has always been like this and it always will be because mens achilles heel is that they go to pieces when a woman drops her top oldstyle feminists never understood this but their way is not the only way to achieve equality with men the world is different now and we should follow the trends instead of waving the banners of years ago that version of feminism will never regain its popularity as long as its proponents insist on lecturing instead of leading we should be working together to support women in this country and across the world whose rights are still ignored instead of squabbling and catfighting men are great at working together they are selfcongratulatory and supportive we are not that is our true weakness and feminism exemplifies this flaw witness the countless factions all fighting for different things from sexpositive feminists who believe nudity is ok to thirdwave feminists who think eyeliner is misogynistic if a thong makes you feel fabulous wear it for one thing men in the office waste whole afternoons staring at your bottom placing bets on whether youre wearing underwear let them use that time to take over the company but even if you wear naughty lingerie for you for no other reason than it makes you feel good that is reason enough to keep it on true feminism should celebrate femininity and make you feel wonderful to be born a woman its a shame some feminists today cant do the same kate taylor is the

the government must challenge mens attitudes to sex because other attempts at tackling rape are not working the home office minister fiona mactaggart has said changes to the law and improvements in support services had failed to stem attacks she told the guardian adding that some offenders felt victimised when their actions were questioned we need to focus on mens behaviour and teach men they have some responsibility men dont bother to find out where the boundaries are in some cases ms mactaggart said we have done a lot of things to help victims of rape and it still keeps happening it seemed to me that we need some really active crime prevention here and one of the strange things about this offence is the way in which victims commonly feel responsible and perpetrators sometimes feel victimised what we are doing so far isnt working ms mactaggart said she hoped that challenging mens attitudes would also give women confidence that the law was on their side to help tackle ongoing problems of underreporting women do recognise it as a crime the problem is they think its their fault she said the minister was speaking ahead of a advertising campaign urging men to ensure that their partners consent to sex which will be launched in mens magazines such as nuts and zoo as well as on the radio and on posters in the mens toilets of bars and clubs this week using provocative imagery and downtoearth language it will warn that consent is active not passive and that unless women actively say yes men must assume the answer is no im going to have a bad time but you have got to be prepared to use language and media that are not normal suspects for government advertising said ms mactaggart she said the government needed to make people aware of the consequences of their actions quite starkly weve been through campaigns encouraging women to make themselves more safe lets try saying to the perpetrators you think of yourself as just a lad having fun but have you ensured that this woman wants this and has said yes because if you havent there might be consequences the sexual offences act says a person must have the choice freedom and capacity to assent to intercourse but the solicitor general mike obrien said last week that the law might need clarification on the question of whether a woman who was drunk could give consent in the light of several cases which have been thrown out of court the government will publish proposals to improve the conviction rate for rape such as allowing expert witnesses to explain victims behaviour to juries home office research last year showed only out of rape allegations had ended in a conviction the home office believes attitudes towards rape are also a problem a recent amnesty international survey found that more than a quarter of people in the uk believed a woman was at least partly responsible for being raped if she was drunk rape charities expressed concern this weekend about a reported reduction in sentences for sexual offences to be outlined in guidelines from the independent sentencing advisory council but judges are already using the discount for all sentences longer than months whatever the crime after the introduction of longer supervision periods after prisoners release on licence in addition the most dangerous rapists are now receiving a new indefinite sentence imprisonment for public

jail sentences for rapists are to be slashed under controversial new guidelines for judges revealed just days before an official campaign against rape is launched by the government in a move which critics warned would deter traumatised women from reporting sex crimes the sentencing guidelines council sgc is to recommend that future sentences for rape and other sexual offences be cut by per cent for most offenders the observer can reveal that the council an independent body advising the judiciary on how to interpret the law will argue that men should serve shorter sentences because the prison regime is now more demanding in a separate move it is also expected to recommend shortly that men convicted of domestic violence could escape jail terms if they convince the courts they are capable of changing instead they would be sent on courses in the community challenging their attitudes to women these moves would relieve pressure on britains overcrowded prisons but mps and womens groups said they sent the wrong message about the crimes many women fear most while victims could be dissuaded from the ordeal of testifying if they feared the result would only be a short sentence the proposals appear sharply at odds with government attempts to tackle violence against women coming amid a home office advertising campaign warning men to seek womens consent to sex and new plans from the attorney general to boost rape convictions there has been a big struggle to get rape and domestic violence recognised as serious terrible crimes and i do have concerns said julie morgan the labour mp and chair of the allparty group on sex equality it is a terrible struggle for women to bring these cases to court and i dont think we ought to give the message that we think these crimes should be dealt with in a lighter way domestic violence kills one woman every two to three days in the uk while the british crime survey recently estimated one in women has been raped the proposals to cut rape and sexual offence sentences in line with proposals for other violent crimes like robbery will be published for consultation with guidelines finalised later this year the average sentence for rape is now seven years and four months joanne savage secretary to the sgc said it took into account the argument that custodial sentences had become more demanding recently with those sent to prison spending at least half their sentence behind bars once released they are placed under supervision often with strict restrictions until the end of their licence period this is a significant change and people released into the community under supervision from probation officers are at greater risk of being recalled savage said the move will not affect rapists already in prison in some cases rape must still mean life sentences controversially the council will also set out grounds where mitigating circumstances will be taken into account they are expected to include cases involving sexual familiarity between rapist and victim before the attackthat could mean a woman and a man becoming intimate with the woman later refusing full sex only to be overpowered such date rapes where victims know their attacker are the most common form of rape critics accused the government of allowing a uturn on violent crime given that the earlier policy of longer sentences contributed to the fall in crime since

growing numbers of men are rejecting the culture of working long hours in favour of spending more time at home according to a study which reveals a social revolution is taking place as fathers become increasingly involved in bringing up their children men are a substantial and fastrising proportion of those seeking their employers permission to work flexitime with shorter hours or fewer days but they face more obstacles to securing a better worklife balance than women in the last two years million men around per cent of the male workforce have asked their employer if they can work flexibly that is far less than the million women per cent who have sought the same change in their hours but a big increase on previous years the figures are from an examination of britains changing work habits produced for the tuc by three academics called out of time why britain needs a new approach to workingtime flexibility which is published this week more men are seeking the right to switch to working flexitime a nineday fortnight or fourday week so they can be around to help their children and partners and even more would do so if the rules on flexible working were changed so that all workers not just parents could do that said jo morris the tucs worklife balance policy officer jenny watson the chair of the equal opportunities commission said the tucs research confirmed that britain was in the middle of a social revolution in how much time fathers want to spend with their families more fathers are more concerned to be more involved with their families than ever before their desire to do so is moving faster than politicians attitude to this this is a very private revolution which often happens within a family that has to make a decision about childcare and it has gone relatively unnoticed by those making public policy said watson despite action by the government to help new parents paternity leave needed to be extended from its current twoweek minimum and rates of pay for men taking it should be increased to make it easier for them to spend time with a baby added watson while some employers are good on flexible working in other workplaces there can be an assumption that flexible working is for mothers and fathers can find it not just hard to get but even hard to ask for it because the prevailing culture is that if you request it you arent serious about your job said watson since april parents of children under six have been able to ask their employer to vary their hours of work but employers are only legally obliged to give reasonable consideration to such requests the tucs research shows that four in men are not granted all of the changed hours they have requested compared to three in women while one in seven men but one in women have their application rejected completely employers greater unwillingness to let male workers change their hours is unhealthy because it reinforces the pattern of women with children often being locked into lowhours and lowpaid jobs and deepens womens financial dependence on men such as in their pension prospects in old age said morris the tuc eoc and chartered institute of personnel and development want all workers to be able to work flexibly regardless of whether they have children as is already the case in some european countries although allowing flexible working leads to happier more productive employees and greater staff retention some employers see it as difficult to implement and unfair to other workers there is a slow but definite trend towards a woman being the breadwinner in a growing number of households the number of men choosing not to work at all so that they can look after their home or their children has risen from around in to by the end of according to the office of national statistics tia appreciates being walked to school by her dad andy simmonds a gardenergreenkeeper was allowed to start working flexibly by bristol city council so he could

take her to and from school every day it was clearly best for tia if one of us did it rather than a childminder because going to school is a big thing for a fiveyearold kirstin couldnt do it because she works monday to thursday as a teacher which is a very inflexible occupation so i asked the council if instead of working from am to pm i could work from am to pm from monday to thursday during

a mans company is preferable men are vastly more relaxing i find talking about all that emotional rubbish with women so incredibly wearing i hate introspection men are far less screwedup than women they dont make emotional demands or talk endlessly about themselves they talk about politics the theatre that sort of stuff they like to be strong and like to be thought to be strong i think thats perfectly normal men are after all the huntergatherers theyve had to be the guys that have been strong and gone out there and fought battles and i dont think they have entirely lost the habit of posturing that way im not naming any names the men i know in parliament are exactly the same as other men some are stupid some are clever some are very honest some are less so both women and men are capable of using their sexuality though women can be much more manipulative with it men tend to think they can take what they want i dont worry about these things i think its a sad thing to think about i havent married due to a mixture of choice and chance the chance was that mr right didnt come along the choice was that he was never a sufficient priority to go out and find im perfectly happy its not an issue for me we tend to think spinsterhood is a poor female state but there are plenty of unhappy bachelors when i get asked questions like am i a good flirt or when was your first kiss i despair the press is always writing about my relationship in oxford i had a boyfriend at oxford so no wonder feminism failed if years later were still talking in those terms men have had a rotten deal since time began its men who have been the ones who until recently had to carry all the economic responsibility for a family they have had to do lots of pretty tough stuff in order to feed the family in modern times men have been the forgotten victims in family breakup theyre supposed to keep a stiff upper lip fork out the maintenance cheques and not be upset that they havent seen little johnny for the last month if a woman wants to she can make it very diffi cult for a man to continue a normal fatherhood i would hate to have been born a man i dont think of myself as a woman mp i just think of myself as an mp however other peoples attitudes may be conditioned by sex for example neil kinnock said he always found it particularly hard to be rude to margaret thatcher across the dispatch box precisely because she was a woman he was from a time when you opened doors for a woman weve lost that now and our society is coarsened as a result when it comes to feminism i think weve gone overboard and underboard frankly even today far too much emphasis is put on womens appearances i get very cross when people mention my change of image i didnt change my image and i certainly didnt dye my hair blonde to attract men i went blonde because its much easier to keep white hair fair than it is to keep white hair dark i also think its terrible that we have completely denied the value of a woman who stays at home and decides to bring up the kids i had a fulltime mother and look at me when it comes to children if someone says to me would i rather have had them or not then the answer is obviously yes however i think every woman in parliament has got the right to look every man in parliament in the eye and know she got there in exactly the same way he did if she cant do that she becomes a secondclass citizen and i dont want to see secondclass citizens on the conservative benches but i dont have any regrets about being childless and therefore its probably just as well i didnt have children,2006-03,man company preferable men vastly relaxing find talking emotional rubbish woman incredibly wearing hate introspection men far less screwedup woman dont make emotional demand talk

a advertising campaign is to be launched next week in mens magazines on radio and with posters in toilets in urban pubs and clubs stressing that men need to make sure a woman has agreed to sex to avoid any accusation of rape the home office campaign is designed to help tackle rape by educating young men about the need for consent before sex giving consent is active not passive and its up to everyone to make sure that their partner agrees to sexual activity a home office spokeswoman said the advertising campaign follows the introduction of the sexual offences act which emphasised the importance of adults agreeing to sex and having the freedom and capacity to make a choice new measures are being considered by the government to try to drive up the low conviction rate for rapes including a proposal to allow expert witnesses to be called in rape cases to explain the behaviour of victims the solicitorgeneral mike obrien also disclosed yesterday that a change in the rape laws is being considered to require juries to decide whether a woman who has consumed too much alcohol is too drunk to give her consent concern grew over the low conviction rate in rape cases last year after home office research showed that only of reported cases ended in the rapist being convicted mr obrien said yesterday that further changes in the law might be needed to deal with the question of whether a woman had drunk too much to give consent in order to stop cases being thrown out it may be that the legislation needs some clarification because these sorts of mistakes shouldnt be being made i do think there have been cases in which some extremely wellqualified judges and barristers have taken a view on the law which was not the intention of parliament the solicitorgeneral told the bbc a survey commissioned by amnesty international found that more than a quarter of people in the uk believed a woman was at least partly responsible for being raped if she was drunk the government is to publish proposals this month to reverse the fall in the rape conviction rate the measures are expected to include the introduction of expert witnesses in court to explain the behaviour of rape victims it is also likely to propose that victims be allowed to give evidence by prerecorded video so that they do not have to confront the man who raped them and relive the experience in court the

men must ensure that a woman has consented to sex to avoid being accused of rape a new home office campaign will warn the move comes amid concerns that an allegation of rape is less likely to lead to a conviction than ever before a home office spokeswoman said an awareness campaign would be launched next week in a bid to reduce the number of rapes by educating young men in particular about the need to gain consent for sex the campaign will include radio and magazine advertisements as well as posters in mens toilets in pubs and clubs the issue of consent was central to the sexual offences act which stated that a person must agree to sex by choice and have the freedom and capacity to make a choice the spokeswoman said giving consent is active not passive and its up to everyone to make sure that their partner agrees to sexual activity she said just of complaints lead to a rapist being punished despite longrunning government efforts to boost results home office research found that of allegations of rape made in there were just convictions down from the previous year in cases the rapist pleaded guilty and the remainder were convictions at trial researchers found that there was a culture of scepticism towards rape victims among police and prosecutors which led victims to lose confidence in the judicial system separate research last year found that onethird of people questioned believed a woman was to blame for being raped if she had behaved in a flirtatious manner more than also believed a woman was at least partly responsible for being raped if she wore sexy or revealing clothing or was drunk,2006-03,men must ensure woman ha consented sex avoid accused rape new home office campaign warn move come amid concern allegation rape less likely lead conviction ever home office spokeswoman said awareness campaign would launched next week bid reduce number rape educating young men particular need gain consent sex campaign include radio magazine advertisement well poster men toilet pub club issue consent wa central sexual offence act stated person must agree sex choice freedom capacity make choice spokeswoman said giving consent active passive everyone make sure partner agrees sexual activity said complaint lead rapist punished despite longrunning government effort boost result home office research found allegation rape made conviction previous year case rapist pleaded guilty remainder conviction trial researcher found wa culture scepticism towards rape victim among police prosecutor led victim lose confidence judicial system separate research last year found onethird people questioned believed woman wa blame raped behaved flirtatious manner also believed woman wa least partly responsible raped wore sexy revealing clothing wa drunk,"['men', 'must', 'ensure', 'woman', 'ha', 'consented', 'sex', 'avoid', 'accused', 'rape', 'new', 'home', 'office', 'campaign', 'warn', 'move', 'come', 'amid', 'concern', 'allegation', 'rape', 'less', 'likely', 'lead', 'conviction', 'ever', 'home', 'office', 'spokeswoman', 'said', 'awareness', 'campaign', 'would', 'launched', 'next', 'week', 'bid', 'reduce', 'number', 'rape', 'educating', 'young', 'men', 'particular', 'need', 'gain', 'consent', 'sex', 'campaign', 'include', 'radio', 'magazine', 'advertisement', 'well', 'poster', 'men', 'toilet', 'pub', 'club', 'issue', 'consent', 'wa', 'central', 'sexual', 'offence', 'act', 'stated', 'person', 'must', 'agree', 'sex', 'choice', 'freedom', 'capacity', 'make', 'choice', 'spokeswoman', 'said', 'giving', 'consent', 'active', 'passive', 'everyone', 'make', 'sure', 'partner', 'agrees', 'sexual', 'activity', 'said', 'complaint', 'lead', 'rapist', 'punished', 'despite', 'longrunning', 'government', 'effort', 'boost', 'result', 'home', 'office', 'research', 'found', 'allegation', 'rape', 'made', 'conviction', 'previous', 'year', 'case', 'rapist', 'pleaded', 'guilty', 'remainder', 'conviction', 'trial', 'researcher', 'found', 'wa', 'culture', 'scepticism', 'towards', 'rape', 'victim', 'among', 'police', 'prosecutor', 'led', 'victim', 'lose', 'confidence', 'judicial', 'system', 'separate', 'research', 'last', 'year', 'found', 'onethird', 'people', 'questioned', 'believed', 'woman', 'wa', 'blame', 'raped', 'behaved', 'flirtatious', 'manner', 'also', 'believed', 'woman', 'wa', 'least', 'partly', 'responsible', 'raped', 'wore', 'sexy', 'revealing', 'clothing', 'wa', 'drunk']",127
i wonder what toulouselautrec would have made of edinburghs big daddy os would he have given us his impressions of the stagnight roarers beneath the pole in lothian roads home of the big beer gratifyingly the scottish executives adult entertainment working group aewg is keen to ensure artistic endeavour is protected in the wake of its study of seamy male gratification regulations designed to minimise exploitation should not by accident restrict genuine artistic freedom the who made up the aewg some councillors some academics have spent a year studying our less salubrious entertainments they reported last week and the headlines said it all strip joints on their last lap dancers will be ordered to remain a metre from their customers there will be no hiding in secret booths and no simulated stimulation its a thoughtful wellwritten but ultimately wrongheaded review it hits many of the right notes clearly its researchers have spoken at length to those involved yet a tellingly westcoast paternalism sours the whole women have danced for men in all times and in all cultures the report reads before going on to say the fact that there is a demand for sexually exploitative activities does not make these activities legitimate the aewg faced a choice either it could deal with the reality and make life better for the strippers or it could air its disapproval it made the wrong choice lets be clear that were not talking about prostitution that has been given its own working group instead this is about the lap dancers in scotland the report itself tells us that for most its a second job a chance to earn up to a shift financial reward was not mentioned by any performer as the sole reason for starting dancing enjoyment excitement and curiosity were more frequently mentioned as the main reasons for being attracted this is a far cry from the issues facing that second working group such as the commercial trade in women from eastern europe while asserting that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the naked human body the aewg is despairing about how little it can do about the desires those bodies provoke we are conscious that tightening up the regulations for adult entertainment does little to affect underlying attitudes and that should be the longerterm aim the group then offers excellent recommendations saying performers should be given dedicated changing rooms should be protected from club owners arbitrary fines and from freezing temperatures if this report settled for stamping out exploitation then it would be of great benefit to the dancers instead it recommends that there should be no private booths no simulated sex and an unenforceable metre distance between dancer and punter given these private dances are the performers only extra source of money this will slash their profits edinburghs attitude is liberal allowing a leeway for lap dancers just as it turns a blind eye to saunas in glasgow the old morality stands in opposition to the degradation of women so dancers are restricted and prostitutes get beaten and murdered on the streets while the professions shouldnt be compared the two cities should and one is increasingly international while the other is increasingly parochial perhaps one day underlying attitudes will change and men wont want women to dance naked for them until then the government should protect the dancers give them power give them rights legislate disapproval and we will only aid the exploiters ruaridhnicollhotmailcom,2006-04,wonder toulouselautrec would made edinburgh big daddy

once upon a time when a man had a daughter one of his main concerns was how to foot the wedding bill now he is more anxious to cushion her against inequality so if research completed this week is correct he casts his vote according to what he sees as his daughters best interests and they surprisingly perhaps to some lie on the left a range of influences attract people to the left but according to professor andrew oswald of the university of warwick and dr nattavudh powdthavee of the london institute of education significant among those influences is the presence of daughters in their study submitted to an american academic journal they say that if a man fathers a girl the likelihood of him voting for a leftwing party defined generously as labour or liberal democrat increases by for each daughter oswald and powdthavee employ mathematical formulae and tentative conjecture to argue that leftwing individuals come from extended families into which over recent past generations many females have been born they have found that strings of daughters through the generations lead to leftwing families today think tony booth and his many daughters or the late john smith and his three while strings of sons move parents rightwards so why do sons and daughters have a different political impact on parents moving into tricky darwinian waters oswald says that the raison detre of the majority of parents is to see their children prosper and achieve happiness the more contented the children the better the chances of them breeding thus securing the genetic line since most females still face inequality parents subconsciously see this as an impediment to contentment as a result their support shifts to a party that pledges to help the disadvantaged the argument continues women in the main face pay discrimination and are largely responsible for childcare so they rely more on services provided by the public sector services in which labour has traditionally invested compared with males females are more in favour of higher taxes to fund provision such as the nhs higher taxation also affects them less since they tend to be in a lowerincome bracket as men acquire female children oswald and powdthavee write those men gradually shift their political stance and become more sympathetic to the female desire for a larger amount for the public good they become more left wing similarly a mother with sons becomes sympathetic to the male case for lower taxes and a smaller supply of public goods the thesis appears to be blown out of the water by a quick trot around the stately homes of england aristocratic families have had squadrons of daughters and never wavered from being true blue nevertheless the authors insist that as a broader trend their argument has statistical robustness oswald and powdthavee drew their data from the british household panel survey for the years to monitoring adults in households among parents with three sons and no daughters voted left in households with three daughters and no sons voted for the left among switchers the trend is even more marked in the year period switched from left to right switched from right to left the voters who swung from right to left had on average more daughters the trend left prevails regardless of income education or employment since as yet we are not allowed to order up the gender of our offspring the academics argue it is the daughters who supply the x factor for the left when it comes to the ballot box in other words children shape parents oswald and powdthavee also argue that women are inherently collectivist while men are more individualistic biological determinism has for centuries imprisoned the aspirations of men and women certainly that inherent female collectivism was not evident from the postwar era until the thatcherite s then women voted in greater numbers for the tories as the party of the family that emphasised the responsibility of the individual to provide for his and it was his own what is clear however is that men and women view politics through a very different lens because of who does what on a daily basis women make up almost half the labour market but they also carry out the overwhelming majority of housework childcare and caring for elderly dependants work by academics including rosie campbell of birkbeck college london and pippa norris of harvard university show how this ethic of care has an impact on political attitudes internationally young women in particular have been moving to the left it might be assumed that as they become better educated and their income rises they will be less concerned with the public good and adopt what oswald and powdthavee term individualistic male attitudes however regardless of womens individual economic status in focus groups and voting habits many still have a concern for the particular needs and experiences of others perhaps because of this connection with the world of unpaid care labour tapped into that in but women arent easily bought off and their concerns also embrace civil liberties the economy and iraq in more than of women voted the next general election may see the lowest turn out since when only of voters truned out the local elections next week may not fare much better large swathes of women particularly the unders who helped to give labour its original victory are on electoral strike against what many see as a conservative greedy divisive government that takes on a more feminine face only during elections the think tank demos has talked of this as widespread political disconnection others talk of apathy as if it is a disease of the young another reading is far more radical many women young and old are deeply interested in politics they turn out in higher numbers when a woman stands for parliament not because they are sexist but because she may represent a difference in style priorities and content norris applies the theory of critical mass from nuclear physics to politics and change in society nuclear reaction can be contained only to a certain point when enough uranium is assembled an unstoppable chain reaction occurs women have yet to reach that critical mass in politics once they do the policy agenda political discourse and the look of institutions will alter radically for both left and right the tragedy is that labours betrayal may forfeit the opportunity to achieve that critical mass if women do not get into the habit of voting young they tend never to acquire the habit katherine rake director of the fawcett society which campaigns to close the inequality gap says its research shows an increasing proportion of young women are radical but alienated from westminster what we have via the internet and blogging is a huge amount of very angry young women whats missing is a focus for that energy if oswald and powdthavee are right we face a paradox while daughters act as a catalyst on their parents political belief they themselves in increasing numbers are doing nothing to exercise their democratic muscle in elections because no party adequately reflects their views as a result power is retained not just by the right of centre but also by the traditional white male establishment unless that is that mysterious alchemy seen at work in france occurs here and daughters take to the streets miracles can

it used to be my guilty secret i only ever whispered the n word to my very closest friends if pressed i might talk about my childminder a lie but far easier to live with and rather less likely to attract tuttutting after all how could a selfrespecting leftleaning professional woman do such a thing but now at last i can confess i employ a nanny to look after my children nannies once the butt of jokes and the sole preserve of the wellheeled are now an everyday option and increasingly the preferred choice for ordinary working parents and nanny employers like me once a silent slightly embarrassed minority are standing up to be counted a survey this week compiled from nanny employment agencies by a nannysharing website called sharingcouk appears to show that the number of nannies in britain has now risen to more than for the first time what could account for such a rise the first reason must be money these days employing a nanny is about reducing costs not increasing class status according to the daycare trust nursery fees have soared over the past five years outstripping inflation by more than in london a fulltime nursery place costs around per week some nurseries charge up to per year if you have two preschool children as i once did its often cheaper to employ one person in your home than pay for two places in the local nursery according to graham newton who runs a payroll company called nannypaye recent government financial incentives such as childcare vouchers make nannies an even more attractive option and despite reports of the modern nanny demanding city banker incomes newtons experience is that salaries have settled the influx of labour from the new european countries has made a difference he says they may not be ukqualified but they fulfil the upmarket au pair role it has capped the wages nannies are demanding making them slightly more reasonable its cheaper still if you share that nanny with friends or a neighbour as is increasingly happening an estimated of nannies are now looking after children from more than one family the internet has made it far easier to chum up enter your postcode on a site such as thenannysharerscouk and you can be linked with a compatible family close by sharing also overcomes the major drawback to having your very own nanny before my kids started school and i had a secret sole nanny i felt obliged to take them along to every saturday morning activity on offer so that they spent time with likeminded minimates with nanny sharing your kids have builtin friends then there is the flexibility you get from a nanny checking your kids in to a nursery at am and picking them up at pm is fine if your job is as regular as clockwork and you can guarantee the phone wont ring just as you are walking away from your desk but that often isnt the case in real life liz bayram chief executive of the national childminding association which includes nannies says flexibility is at the heart of a nannys appeal having a nanny may be the only way you can have siblings looked after together and you cant phone up a nursery to say youre running a bit late and could they pick up your child from its football club like the vast majority of working parents flexible childcare makes my working life possible dropping the kids off at nursery en route to the first interview is a major manoeuvre i know ive tried it for more than a year i didnt only have to worry about not having posset on my suit but also having three kids all brushed and washed by am with a nanny your kids can work to their timetable not yours the delight of being able to hand them over first thing still cornflakeencrusted and in their pyjamas is immeasurable for all concerned and if you have a child with any special need from disability to longterm illness care outside the home often isnt an option only a nanny will do what you would if you were around nannies too do far more than childcare if you are running out of washing powder you cant ask the nursery assistant to pick up a packet on the way back from the park or if you are rushing out the door in the morning to catch the and your fouryear old has just spilt its frosties all over the floor you hope they wont still be there when you get back at seven that night a nanny may not clean but she nearly always wipes these are all possetive reasons to have nannies but there are also negative ones the rise and rise of the british nanny has been attributed to the dripdrip effect of documentaries showing abusive nursery assistants plopping toddlers on dirty potties but i for one think that safety is a poor reason to opt for a nanny day nurseries are stringently regulated by ofsted and are legally required to carry out background checks on all staff says purnima tanuku chief executive of the national day nurseries association nannies are not regulated in the same way so its important that parents carefully check references qualifications and experience i have used a local authority nursery as well as a nanny and discovered that checks for anyone employed outside the home are far greater than for anyone employed inside my current nanny is policechecked and registered but in the past ive been fooled i once employed a woman with excellent written references of course i phoned her former employer just to double check she told me the children had grown so fond of her that they called her auntie it was several months later that i discovered why the former employer was in fact the nannys sister she really was their auntie after all another perhaps notsopossetive reason for choosing a nanny is our belief in the benefits of oneonone over oneonmany childcare having a nanny gives us the illusion if not the reality of control who really knows what happens when you wave goodbye each morning i have learned that we can only exercise certain limits if we employ professional women to look after our children then we have to trust them laying down the law about what they are given for tea in your absence may be as far as you can go but many parents like to think that a nanny is more likely to play their offspring baby mozart and practice n for nanny than a childminder would with a crowd of kids to control one friend once phoned me in rage she had caught her nanny committing the crime of reading a newspaper while she was supposed to be looking after the threeyear old she didnt employ her to do that i laughed but isnt that exactly what a parent would do i want a nanny but one with a soft and slovenly heart my three children have now started school but i still employ a nanny neither my life nor my childrens are very regimented so it suits us all best in fact i wouldnt have been able to write this article without her,2006-04,used

as few as of men convicted of domestic violence are sent to prison while a clear majority escape with a fine according to new home office figures published this week the official breakdown of sentences passed by specialist domestic violence courts show that there are more than one million victims of domestic violence as much as five times higher than previously recognised the disclosure comes as ministers consider draft proposals from the sentencing guidelines council which suggest that while domestic violence should be treated as seriously as any other violent offence those men who are genuinely sorry for their domestic violence should have the chance of avoiding being sent to jail the courts may be urged to send offenders on an intensive domestic abuse programme run by the probation service which consists of classes over weeks instead of going to jail the latest figures based on a small sample of cases in five specialist courts show that of those convicted are sent on such programmes fiftynine per cent are fined or ordered to pay compensation given a conditional discharge a community punishment order and only jailed a study of cases in a west london magistrates court showed a slightly different picture with of those convicted being fined given a conditional discharge on community rehabilitation orders on community punishment orders and sent to jail a home office spokeswoman said the government had legislated to ensure that serious violent or sexual offenders were securely and properly dealt with in some cases this will mean that such offenders will spend longer in prison and in some cases be detained indefinitely we are crystal clear that there will always be a prison space for serious and dangerous offenders she added that domestic violence covered a wide range of offences from murder to common assault and the key issue was having a range of sentences which were appropriate to the crime one reason why so few perpetrators of domestic violence go to prison is that the courts cannot pass sentence on the basis that the violence has happened frequently where the other incidents were not reported or charged or have not been proved or admitted home office research shows that on average a woman endures incidents of domestic abuse before making a complaint to the police criminologists say that some victims see it as a private family matter to be kept within the home or they fear that police involvement will make the situation worse the home office is running an advertising campaign aimed at family and friends as well as victims in an attempt to encourage earlier reporting of domestic violence cases the criminal justice act also provided a greater opportunity for the prosecution to draw attention to previous unreported violent incidents as evidence of the defendants character but it has yet to be seen how widely this will be used in the courts criminologists say the most accurate estimate of the extent of domestic violence comes from a british crime survey selfcompletion study of the issue involving a nationally representative sample of people it defined domestic violence as abuse threats or force of a nonsexual form and shows that of women and of men have experienced at least one incident of domestic violence since they were the annual bcs estimate says that there were about incidents of domestic abuse in however the special bcs study points at more than a million victims each year with m incidents involving threats or force happening each year in england and wales researchers say the number would be even greater if the many sexual assaults that take place within the home were also included although the special study used a different method of calculation which makes comparisons inappropriate the researchers estimate that the underlying rate of domestic violence is at least five times higher than that disclosed by the annual bcs survey it found that of women say they have suffered being pushed held down or slapped a wide range of behaviour is now officially recognised as domestic violence including nonphysical forms such as criticism pressure tactics belittling breaking trust oppressive control of finances and harassment violent domestic incidents can lead to death with half of all female murder victims being killed by their partners or expartners unlike other forms of violence domestic violence is rarely a oneoff incident those who suffered domestic violence told the bcs study that they faced an average of incidents a year of them involving force being used in a third of cases the violence started during pregnancy and if the man had already been abusive the pregnancy often escalated the violence involved,2006-04,men convicted domestic violence

people who beat their partners could escape with a community sentence if they apologise for their actions under plans that were dismissed today as ludicrous in new advice to judges issued in draft form yesterday the sentencing guidelines council sgc said remorseful domestic violence could get a community order or suspended sentence cases which might lead to the offender avoiding a jail sentence could include those where the attacker shows genuine signs of remorse or where both partners wanted to stay together the advice said offenders would also be forced to attend courses to curb their violent behaviour the head of a domestic violence charity has dismissed the plan as a travesty sandra horley chief executive of refuge urged ministers to reject the proposals which have gone to consultation before a final version is drawn up she told the daily mail the idea that sending domestic violence perpetrators on courses as an alternative to a custodial sentence is ludicrous and would put more lives at risk the sgc proposals are a backward step and will make a mockery of governments commitments to address domestic violence which after all kills two women a week we know that rigorous arrest charging and sentences in custody for these crimes acts as an effective deterrent we want this policy put into practice nearly half of all female murder victims are killed by their partners or expartners according to the british crime survey of women and of men aged to have experienced domestic violence the survey estimated there were m separate incidents a year the sgc chaired by the lord chief justice lord phillips of worth matravers stressed that domestic violence cases should be treated as no less serious than other violent crimes but its new guidelines also said if the court is satisfied that the offender genuinely intends to reform hisher behaviour and there is a real prospect of rehabilitation being successful it may be appropriate to impose a sentence that will allow the offender to be rehabilitated rather than the imposition of a short custodial sentence an appropriate disposal in such situations might be a suspended sentence order or a community order in either case with a requirement to attend a domestic violence programme domestic violence should be punished more severely by the courts if it was witnessed by children or if they were aware of it taking place elsewhere in the home said the document it also stressed that any assertion that the victim had provoked an attack should be treated with great care if the victim expressed any pleas for mercy on their partners behalf the courts should be sure that they were genuine views and were not expressed under duress or did not put them at risk of further violence it added the hadow home secretary david davis said the tragic events of the last two years in the failure to assess violent criminals who are given early release probation or parole and have gone on to commit violent crimes even murder demonstrate how easy it is to make a mistake discretion as proposed by the sgc should only ever be used with extreme caution mistakes in this area could result in the most appalling consequences a home office spokesman said these are draft guidelines which the government will comment on in due course in the usual way the government believes prison is for dangerous violent or sexual offenders which is why we have legislated to ensure that such offenders which includes perpetrators of the most serious cases of domestic violence will spend longer in prison and in some cases be detained indefinitely new special domestic violence courts give both victims and witnesses a stronger platform to get their voices heard and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice,2006-04,people beat partner could escape community sentence apologise action plan dismissed today ludicrous new advice judge issued draft form yesterday sentencing guideline council sgc said

a woman attacked by lottery rapist iorwath hoare in today lost her appeal against a decision that she could not claim compensation for the psychological trauma she suffered lawyers for the yearold former teacher referred to as mrs a argued that the normal sixyear limit for claiming compensation after a deliberate assault should be set aside in this case however the master of the rolls sir anthony clarke lord justice brooke and lady justice arden upheld the earlier decision and said they were bound by an existing house of lords ruling mrs a was when hoare who by then had already subjected six other women to sexual assaults including rape attacked her in roundhay park leeds hoare now was jailed for life the following year and spent years in prison he bought a winning national lottery ticket worth m while on day release from prison in and now reportedly lives in a house near newcastle in october last year a high court judge upheld an initial decision that mrs as compensation claim should be struck out because it had been brought more than six years after the assault the limitation act gives a nonextendable sixyear period for such claims at the appeal hearing in february mrs as counsel alan newman qc told the threejudge panel that hoare had no assets before his lottery win meaning a civil action would have been neither sensible nor proportionate she began her claim after hearing of his new wealth he said there was something very wrong in the law if his client was not able to claim compensation for hoares vicious and disgusting attack the judges had to decide whether under these circumstances the human rights act meant mrs a should be allowed to claim compensation beyond the sixyear limit he said todays ruling however said that because the sixyear limitation period had expired before the act came into force it could not be used the law commission the official law reform body recommended five years ago that the law should be reformed to prevent further injustices the government has accepted the case for change but has not yet legislated mrs as appeal is one of three test cases going through the courts testing the strict sixyear limit mrs a

as glass ceilings go it tends to be the salary and promotion inequalities that grab all the attention however in the arena of claiming expenses there is also evidence that some organisations are discriminating against women the average man employee in the uk spends nearly more a night on a hotel room during a business trip than the average female employee compared with according to research by globalexpense a specialist outsource firm that handles staff expenses claims for employers such as sainsburys wh smith roche and renault and the difference between the sexes does not end with the cost of a bed for the night while in a hotel men spend more on inroom entertainment including satellite tv room service and minibars says david vine the director of globalexpense the differences in attitude to expenses among men and women is also highlighted by a survey of expenseaccount travellers published last month barclaycards business travel survey shows that while of men claim expenses without a receipt only of their female colleagues are given the same privilege and while women are more likely than men to use the train for business trips they are significantly less likely compared with to travel first class when they do so the survey also shows that women who account for of managers in the uk travel only half as many miles as men do for work and are less likely to stay away from home overnight tim carlier the head of card issuing at barclaycard business believes the differences may come down to experience women are less experienced in business travel than men and this is perhaps why their approach to expenses is more conservative he says if their company policy is to claim firstclass rail travel for example though i certainly think they should take advantage of it although women can be modest when it comes to spending on their own comfort they tend to splash out more on client entertainment or team jollies according to globalexpense vine says the average woman employees expenses claim on client entertainment is compared with a more parsimonious for men while a woman managers expenses bill for entertaining her team or members of her department is almost double that claimed by her male counterparts despite womens apparent reluctance to cane their personal expenses it seems that their claims sheet come under greater scrutiny than those put in by men according to the credit card firm visas eu business travel survey a third of women business travellers have their expenses routinely questioned including their use of taxis entertainment budgets hotel room service personal telephone calls and newspaper or magazine bills this compares with of men business travellers who say their expenses are similarly scrutinised although visas survey was carried out in many believe the situation has not changed the attitude in my firm is that i am lucky at to have a job that entails so much foreign travel and i shouldnt push my luck by overclaiming on expenses says one woman travel agent my male colleagues though are expected and tacitly encouraged to claim more or less what they like on bar bills or latenight taxis and they feel quite relaxed about doing so male tardiness may also explain the differences in the expense culture the barclaycard survey shows that of men compared with of women take up to a month to hand in their expenses claims and are therefore less likely perhaps to have them pored over by eagleeyed bosses meanwhile of women make expenses an immediate priority on their return from a business trip there are four explanations for the expenses inequity between men and women first as more experienced business travellers men are less scrupulous than women and are more likely to alter a to or pass off friday nights chinese meal for five mates as a legitimate business meeting second and as barclaycards survey shows women are far quicker at handing in expense sheets making it easier to scrutinise every phone call and taxi third womens position in many organisations remains tenuous and they are still expected or even encouraged to spend less on client entertaining or on travel than their male counterparts despite years of legislation outlawing discrimination on the grounds of gender many pieces of research have shown that as women move up the career ladder they tend to receive less pay and fewer perks such as new company cars or bigger offices than men so to discover that their expenses are also clipped is no great surprise to me says marilyn davidson a professor of work psychology at manchester business school to continually question a womans expenses on behalf of the firm is to denigrate her professional standing and to keep her in a subordinate position its not something many men would tolerate and finally while senior women tend to be far rarer and therefore more visible than senior men in many organis ations making even a routine expenses sheet more likey to be questioned women themselves must shoulder some blame for such scrutiny adds davidson women often sit back and say that they are more interested in doing their job well than claiming first class travel or demanding the latest company car but in the long run this refusal to fight for the same treatment as their male counterparts does them no good she says until they understand that their status in the eyes of colleagues and clients can often rest on perks such as better offices or more generous expense accounts they will continue to enjoy less status and influence at work according to the budget hotel chain travelodge which recently produced its own survey of travel expenses in association with office angels the most eyepopping expenses claims tend to be submitted thirdhand by pas and secretaries on behalf of superiors among the most outrageous claims uncovered by travelodge last year was a bill for the respray of a private helicopter and a fourfigure sum for a business meeting held in a wellknown lapdancing club while these two business expenses were happily honoured by the companies concerned another bill was not a expense claim for a replacement pair of shoes and trousers

support groups reacted angrily today to reports that the number of rapists being cautioned rather than jailed has more than doubled over the past decade the revelation that rapists had been cautioned in compared with in left one group shocked while another womens organisation described cautioning offenders as a slap on the wrist the figures come at a time when the conviction rate for rape has fallen sharply crown prosecution service guidelines say a cautioned individual must admit the offence and there must be a realistic prospect of conviction the advice adds that indictable offences such as rape can only result in a caution in rare circumstances the head of rape crisis nicole westmarland said rape was a crime that had a serious impact on its victims for years or even decades it is completely unacceptable that rapists are able to continue living their daytoday lives or even be free to rape again she said rape is an offence that carries a maximum of life imprisonment and we shouldnt be cautioning for these types of offences said sandra horley the chief executive of the national domestic violence charity refuge rape is one of the most serious offences in the land and refuge has real concerns that cautioning is dangerous and in cases where consent is clearly never given introducing cautioning places women in grave danger we need to send out a strong public message that rape and domestic violence are serious crimes and should be treated as such ruth hall of women against rape told bbc radio s today programme that most men would take a caution as a slap on the wrist most men who rape dont do it just once they are serial offenders and women have tried and tried to get the criminal justice system to take it seriously women have been coming forward in record numbers only to have the door slammed in our faces she said the liberal democrat home affairs spokesman nick clegg said there were circumstances in which cautions were appropriate such as when rape victims did not want to go through a trial but he added we really do need to know more i think public confidence in the way in which we deal with rape cases is already under serious strain now this disclosure that cautions are being issued in circumstances which we dont know about seems to me doesnt help rebuild that confidence the cps today gave two examples of cautions for rape being given in one case last year a pensioner accepted a caution for raping his sister when they were both children years ago in another case a yearold boy was given the equivalent of a caution for raping a young child a youth offending team including police and social services worked with him to show him that his behaviour was wrong it said cautions were only used in very extreme circumstances there would need to be evidence and a clear admission of guilt whilst age welfare and mental wellbeing of the victim would also be factors said the deputy assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police john yates who speaks for the association of chief police officers on rape issues he said those cautioned would have to comply with the provisions of the sex offenders register a home office spokesman said the government was committed to bringing more rapists to justice and increasing the poor conviction rate on saturday the department published a consultation paper intended to address the current low conviction rate fewer than of rape cases reported to the police result in a conviction although the number of rape convictions has remained stable the number of cases reported to police is increasing year on year meaning the proportion ending in conviction has declined from around one in three in to one in in rape is an appalling crime it devastates the lives of victims and their families however rape will always be a difficult offence to prosecute he said the use of cautions in individual cases is a matter for the police and the cps who will only use such sanctions under the most exceptional circumstances the times reported that in cautions for rape had been given to nine boys aged between and boys aged between and men aged and over and one female who admitted raping another woman in the same year a further people were convicted of rape only of the rapes reported to police there were incidents of serious sexual assault against women aged between and in england and wales in the

theres been this big pervading myth about women being complicated in fact its the opposite theyre quite straightforward they have their ups and downs but they dont wind up being serial killers and they are less likely to be drug addicts or geniuses than men in fact they are underrepresented at all the extremes of human existence thats not to say i dont know brilliant women i think my wife liz jones is a brilliant woman but ive never seen a woman flip out or go to an extreme like a guy would i admit i can be annoying but who doesnt annoy the wife a man is on the slide to madness if he lets a woman dictate how he should be as soon as you let a woman push you around she will despise you women find chauvinism without malice quite attractive thats not to say i dont believe in feminism im reaping the dividends of it my best friends are dykes and my wife is older and more successful than me do you think id be able to live like this if it was ive got more out of feminism than most women they are far more sexual than they are allowed to be judging by the way they go nuts in the sack i think women should start doing what they like and then see where it takes them im not out to provide them with a manifesto but they could start by acknowledging that men are jerks and then get over it this is why most of my friends are lesbians because they already know this they havent been brainwashed by decades of bullshit provided by glossy magazines the truth about male sexuality and its a truth that women dont like men to admit is that mens egos and sexuality are tightly entwined they need affirmation through sex women try to make out that sex is all about love but it isnt they dont need that component either women can have great sex with a guy theyve only just met i know because ive been there straight women have ridiculous expectations of men liz is a case in point marry a guy whos significantly younger than you then moan about him being immature marry a guy who has his head in the clouds and then be pissed off because hes not a breadwinner the truth is if a woman does marry a ninetofive guy shell spend the rest of her life moaning because hes so boring marriage is not an antiwoman institution i think its an enabler when a woman gets together with a man she has the means to get a mortgage and a better lifestyle ok for me it was different because liz was the successful one but liz has made good dough out of our marriage although shes capitalised on it in an ingenious way and not in the traditional manner the older i get the more i like women its true i get lots of grief from them when they read about me in lizs column but when you meet me you can tell im not like that anyway theyre just trying to find out what their own men are up to its curiosity rather than malice women test mens patience all the time a woman will do something absurd like get half an inch trimmed off her hair and expect that to be the first thing you notice or that shes wearing a top thats almost identical to the dozens of other tops shes bought in the past few weeks and when you think shit shes really pissing me off thats when you know its hormones you can feel the static when a womans coming on most of the time its just a general lowlevel crackling but i do accept that guys are still very shitty towards women my old man gave my mum a hard time despite the success liz has had shes had to put up with a lot of bullshit from men theres probably a sense of disaffection with her own generation which worked in my favour was i surprised liz was attracted to me not really because i was cocky as hell then i was surprised it went as far as it did though its a great affirmation,2006-04,big pervading myth woman complicated fact opposite theyre quite straightforward ups dont wind serial killer less likely drug addict genius men fact underrepresented extreme human existence thats say dont know brilliant woman think wife liz jones brilliant woman ive never seen woman flip go extreme like guy would admit annoying doesnt annoy wife man slide madness let woman dictate soon let woman push around despise woman find chauvinism without malice quite attractive thats say dont believe feminism im reaping dividend best friend dyke wife older successful think id able live like wa ive got feminism woman far sexual allowed judging way go nut sack think woman start like see take im provide manifesto could start acknowledging men jerk get friend lesbian already know havent brainwashed decade bullshit provided glossy magazine truth male sexuality truth

my dad used to drop my siblings and me off at school each morning on the way to work wed listen to the radio and chat about our day and i was oblivious to the fact that this was the s and for a man to say to his office that he wouldnt be in before am because he was doing the school run was very unusual he got a lot of stick for it but thats the way it worked in my house fast forward years and things are changing slowly a mums struggle makes daily headlines having a baby will cost me hundreds of thousands over my lifetime according to one report parenthood is seen as a mums dilemma but new government research suggests that now dads are speaking up too the survey of mothers of month old babies and of the childrens fathers revealed that dads are now deeply involved in their kids upbringing the proportion of fathers working flexible hours to fit around childcare arrangements rose from to between and the number working from home doubled from to its all part say fathers campaigning groups of a real change in the home and workplace this is evidence that there is a social revolution going on with fathers not just talking about being more involved with their children but renegotiating their lives to allow for it says jack osullivan of information charity fathers direct its really good for children families and fathers themselves who get the benefit of being a dad the renegotiating of dads roles includes working shorter hours said they did moving their working day backward or forward to fit around their families changing hours to fit with their partners work and changing jobs altogether its just what my dad did bar the change of job but back in the s when the yuppy working culture meant am board meetings and hour days my dads logic that he was working to pm most days so a am start was fair did not go down well some believe little has changed we need to modernise the laws to keep up to track with the speed of this social change to let fathers play the part they want to play in their childrens lives says osullivan one of the governments proposals on this front is that parents should be able to share their parental leave allowance so that parents could decide how to share out the years leave when a new child is born this will be a popular option for some parents but could also cause some rows a quarter of mums said they would consider sharing some of their months of parental leave with their partner but a third of new fathers would like the option to spend longer with their small children announcing the research conducted by the policy study institute trade and industry secretary alan johnson said there had been a positive culture change in the home and workplace mothers are taking more time off when their child is born the majority of fathers are taking up their new entitlement to paternity leave and the number of new dads now working flexibly has tripled he claimed the findings in the page report were evidence that the governments policy is working after maternity leave was extended from to weeks and unpaid additional leave from to weeks last year half of mothers took weeks leave compared with in and a further took the full weeks compared with just three years previously but while the government is trumpeting the improved takeup of maternity and paternity leave and the evidence that dads are getting more involved women who have children are still counting the cost to their careers some months after the birth of their child one in four mothers were not working some had attempted a return to work only to give it up later but fewer mothers switched jobs when they returned something the reports authors suggested showed employers were taking their commitments to working mothers more seriously three quarters of women who were not working said that they wanted to spend more time with their children but said they couldnt afford childcare said their job didnt provide suitable hours and could not find the right childcare the most likely to return to work were those in higher level jobs with better flexible working opportunities or those with heavy mortgage commitments the governments report did not ask the same questions of the fathers why simply because so few are providing the principal care for their children dads might be more involved but shifting their working day is not the same as shifting their entire careers carena rogers policy officer at the national family and parenting institute says mothers are still much more pressured to give up their careers and it can be very difficult to get back into work my dad might have been a trailblazer but theres still a way to go,2006-04,dad used drop sibling school morning way work wed listen radio chat day wa oblivious fact wa

this is not about being antisex this is not a call for a return to a puritan past where intercourse was had and not heard it is not about being prudish or easily embarrassed or unliberated but it is about anger about feeling shortchanged and wanting to shake awake the majority of us who have been badgered into apathy by the sexual saturation of modern western culture it is about taking back control of sex its meaning and its representation from the market before its too late its about celebrating the human freedom that sex embodies how desire can take us to the heart of our greatest potential that in a moment we might be anybody or anything is this really our world where it is no longer strange to see pictures of breasts on the side of buses where it is considered hip for middleclass men and women to visit swanky lapdancing clubs while remaining oblivious to the continuum of exploitation that links those polished performers with the crackaddicted working girls on the street corner where celebrity magazines detail at length the copulation techniques of minor celebrities but their readers remain unable to choose on any given night whether theyd rather sleep alone a third of young women say that they have been coerced into sex similar data for young men does not exist but i wonder how often they too feel pinioned by expectation this is what sexual liberation coopted by commerce has delivered for women and men a few years ago germaine greer pointed out that while in the s she had fought for womens right to say yes to sex and not to be judged for their appetites nowadays she felt appalled that women no longer had the right to say no for fear of being branded inhibited and repressed the values of the market have turned sex into a competitive sport better faster in ever more inventive contortions the raunch culture identified by the american writer ariel levy puts forward poledancing lessons and nostrings liaisons as evidence of liberation because women are apparently now able to consume sex on an equal footing with men female sexuality is celebrated as increasingly voracious yet the images of women presented by advertisers are eager to please easy to satisfy and as challenging as a blowup doll but how does the white noise of public sex affect personal sexual development there is some evidence that teenagers are becoming more confident about reporting rapes and sexual assaults but if younger women know that they have the right not to be abused they still dont think they have the right to satisfying respectful sex as the brilliant movie kidulthood about the lives of adolescents growing up in west london documents starkly to desire and be desired can be many things funny awkward transforming sacred and profane to be honest about what turns you on demands a particularly intimate bravery but for all we are overinformed about how other people while away their bedroom hours about whats hot and whats not men and women are no closer to developing a common erotic language indeed it seems that that private language is being gradually eradicated from the public domain by the megaphone imperialism of cultural sexism it is a reasonable question to ask do men and women bring the same expectations to sexual intercourse most national surveys show that women want sex less often than men experience orgasm less often and find greater satisfaction in emotional intimacy than in genital sex but does this really mean that women are naturally cuddlecentric finding it impossible to separate sex from love some would suggest that the higher male sex drive has a darwinian rationale i lean towards a more cultural explanation that young girls are taught from an early age that sex is part of a romantic narrative involving love partnership and children while boys are told that it is a discrete act underpinning masculinity the teenagers i know still find themselves stuck with the slapperstud convention around promiscuity it seems to me that we need gender as much as sex education in our schools the process of expressing our wanting of another person is necessarily opaque seduction is by its nature a masque but this is very different from the wholesale sexual irresponsibility encouraged by cultural sexism on these pages last saturday madeleine bunting charted the way that the expectation of sexual availability leads both men and women to outsource the role of seducer to media culture we have been conned into choosing the faux rebellion of visiting a strip club over the far more taxing mutiny of taking full responsibility for how why and with whom we want to have sex there can be no prescription too many moralisers have tried and failed to codify desire but we need to stop fooling ourselves that we can

about housing i refer them my specific responsibility is to work with young parents who want to get back into education ill liaise with the college suggest courses help with applications show them what childcare provision is available and even take them to interviews what are the current pay and conditions in your role a working week is officially hours but i tend to do a bit more salary is per annum plus a lease car your typical day there isnt one thats what i love i could be doing a home visit to a new mum talking to a nursery manager or seeing a tutor in college i spend a lot of time sending texts which sounds odd but thats the way the young parents like to get in touch to ask me questions and confirm appointments and then theres the multiagency aspect so meetings with midwives youth workers and social workers its very varied what do you like most about your job that every day is different and every young person i work with is different its lovely to see them learning new things knowing they trust me is great challenges convincing midwives and health visitors that im not here to force young mums back into education my job is to support them if they want to explore that option even if its parttime finding time to write bids and reports is tricky and the multiagency approach has taken work to properly define what all our roles are so youre not stepping on peoples toes

nothing is more erotic than wisdom experience and good conversation the women are talking dirty again in america first gail sheehy follows up her previous selffidget books on lifecycles and menopauses with sex and the seasoned woman pursuing the passionate life a paean of loosetongued praise for the new universe of lusty liberated women in their fifties and beyond then daphne merkin whose name i wish id made up and who otherwise writes about the joys of spanking rubbishes gail sheehy for painting a rosy picture of what is in fact a depressing time in a womans life all the men she knows preferring bimbos half her age whereupon every other middleaged sex bomb or discontented celibate in america pitches in its great to be if youre a woman and you love sex no it isnt that fairly represents both sides of the debate myself i think coming clean about the amount of lifestyle oral sex you are or are not getting is unseemly at any age it isnt what people do thats demeaning its the language in which they talk about it and because they are puritans pretending to be hedonists american women in particular fail to give good sex talk either theyre salacious without being stimulating or they demur without being decorous attending to the war of words between daphne merkin and gail sheehy i wouldnt have minded making her name up either is like eavesdropping on your maiden aunt asking the vicar what fellatio is that said the whole business of our remaining romantically inclined never mind sexually active for much longer than we ever imagined likely or even desirable without doubt poses new challenges the young think we envy them but none of my friends in their fifties and sixties envies the young anything but their greater distance from death otherwise being young as we observe or remember it stinks and if youth is wasted on the young so without a shadow of a doubt is sex they might be better athletes but its only when you get to that you realise how little athleticism has to do with it for some reason i was one of those who did have an inkling of this early i couldnt do much to change the fact of being young myself but i did seek out women old enough to be my mother lets not get into whether that was oedipal or not lets just say it was sex whichever way you do it is always pathological even chasing men or women the same age as you attests to some psychic disorder or other sibling fixation say or narcissism so its as well simply to factor the freudian component into all we do and move on i chased older women because i liked the way they looked because i felt they represented a greater challenge because i enjoyed their conversation and because i felt more man than boy and i hated being boy in their company perhaps because i was already doing something unexpected and even vaguely transgressive simply by being with them i didnt feel i had to badger them for sex if sex wasnt what they fancied what we were doing already was sex we have grown literalminded since the sixties about what constitutes sex and too much darwin talk has persuaded us that if we are not driven to reproduce ourselves it is because we are of feeble stock and have a subconscious longing to die out i am not proposing abstinence just variation the subtlest variation of sex available to modern men and women being not having any if not having any is what you want you could say that when i sat in the snug of an empty country pub on the moors outside rochdale swooning over the bags beneath my companions eyes or pushing my thumb into the flesh of her forearm and counting how many minutes it took for the indentation to disappear i was practising the nosex version of sex earlier than i should maybe i was a precocious boy in many ways but i prefer to think i was being taught an invaluable lesson that sex is not a gymnasium that a word can be more stimulating than a grunt that eyes age slower than the rest of us and express more sexuality than any other part of the body that eroticism has nothing to do with youth and beauty but everything to do with intelligence and experience spiced preferably with a little disappointment a weary woman was then and still is to me more stimulating than a romping one it might be the case that old age or middle age or middlesex as sheehy cutely calls it is not the resting time it once was yes is the new and one day no doubt will be the new but we delude ourselves if we believe that this means we are privileged not to say obliged to go on doing what we have always done not least when what we have always done has lacked erotic subtlety sheehy trumpets the happy little secret of so many women over ie the amazing sex theyre all having its a kindness to look away when anyone tells you what amazing sex theyre having not because you dont believe them necessarily but because sex is not a separable entity does not begin or end with itself and is a story that is never finally told you say you are getting amazing sex when you are because you dont know any better and have no imagination of what the next day will bring three times that age confers the wisdom of keeping the sex you are having to yourself of not tempting fate by finding it amazing and of not minding much if its nothing of the kind there are other ways you soon discover of having a good time whatever the truth of it the news that so many women over are going at it like teenagers serves no good purpose either it dismays you for their sake or if you are learning to look elsewhere for your satisfactions it dismays you for you own if theyre having it why arent i in daphne merkins case the denial of this happy little secret which once gail sheehy has finished blazing it abroad is hardly much of a secret any longer does not come without its bitterness it would seem fairly selfevident she complains that as women enjoy longer and more active lives in a culture that venerates youth especially in women somethings gotta give and what gives mostly are men men of arent looking for women of well if amazing sex is what theyre after that might be so if amazing sex is what yearold women are after they wont be looking for men of or older either go looking for amazing sex when youre past go dreaming of hunks with biceps and you deserve all the disenchantment you get not because the young give it but are unwilling to give it to you the thing to remember is that the young dont give it full stop no one gives it what sometimes happens as a result of happy coincidence of size or aptitude or circumstance or desire or simply timing is that you stumble on to temporary sensations which are new to you otherwise whats amazing if anything is is how much you enjoy the company or the look of a person with whom as a consequence the sex of whatever sort turns out be rewarding thus those women of who would wish to have what sheehy with indecent suggestiveness calls the time of their lives exclamation mark would do well to put fellatio cunnilingus and all the rest of it to one side and brush up their conversation skills maybe the other stuff will come later maybe it wont maybe at and despite how well you look despite the surgery the local oestrogen therapy the vaginal lubricants and moisturisers i borrow this information from the dirtytalking women ive been reading sex in the allin wrestling sense isnt after all what you your body or your new partner wants though middleaged women and their desires are at the centre of this brouhaha the subject inevitably has some bearing on the middleaged man who whether its a bimbo or a woman his own age he feels he should be chasing is compelled to go on whipping his exhausted manhood into a viagrafuelled frenzy of a sort he thought he had seen the back of long ago of all the cruelties visited on modern man viagra surely is the most pitiless if the body says no the body means no if you wish to argue that sex is not only of the body but is in fact a state of mind then i agree but you do not need viagra to quicken a state of mind though as a boy i liked women senior to me and as a man i now like them my own age so i can claim consistency in my taste for seasoning i would run a mile were i on the market from any woman of sheehys frisky variety riding the tsunami of boomer women finding new dreams and new loves and revitalised sex lives daring redreaming growing nothing worse when youre looking for a good night out to be in the company of a woman or a man growing and redreaming all over you and thats one at a time never mind by the tsunami load a degree of elegant fatigue in a companion is a wonderful thing as is reflectiveness the melancholy that comes with experience the knowledge that growing is not what you are any longer about a face that should be old pretending to the lineaments of youth either by the intercession of surgery or through aping the hungry impetuousness of children is the saddest of sights not only as a matter of principle should we love the look of faces our age but as a matter of aesthetics also yes there is a bloom that comes when you are and goes for ever two years later but its charm is precisely its evanescence longevity is more beautiful to my eye no look can rival for sexual excitement that of someone who has seen the world but still sees something he or she desires in you to be found attractive by a miranda who has hitherto clapped eyes on no man but her father and a caliban comes second best to being drunk to your bed by cleopatra a woman wrinkled deep in time the lover of monarchs and emperors in the past and the mistress of her choice today the advice to act your age should be seen as an opportunity not a prohibition it does not mean you should be booking your place at an old persons home but if it really is so wonderful and so liberating to be seasoned and i happen to be among those who think it is then we show it by being ourselves as we now are not as we fancied we once were dreamdating with the breathlessness of teenagers snogging shagging screeching sobbing and all the rest of it is not the proof that we have attained some new plateau of serenity it merely shows that we cannot bear no

thousands of women in britain may have been shortchanged on statutory maternity pay over the past year because of faulty computer software used to calculate their entitlements for employees who qualify statutory maternity pay smp is payable at per cent of average weekly earnings for the first six weeks of maternity leave then or per cent of average earnings whichever is lower a week for the next weeks previously average earnings were worked out from the qualifying or set period defined as the th week before the week in which the baby is due any increase in the womans earnings between the end of the set period and the end of her maternity leave was thus ignored for the purposes of the calculation unless the pay rise was backdated to the set period in however the european court of justice ecj ruled that from april any pay rise awarded at any time from the beginning of the set period to the end of the maternity leave period would have to be included in the calculation for smp if more than one pay rise was awarded they would all have to be included in the calculation but whether or not an employer is aware of this obligation seems to depend on where it gets its information her majestys revenue and customs hmrc supplies hundreds of thousands of employers with a cdrom that helpfully includes an smp calculator but it doesnt factor in the pay rise issue nor does hmrcs online calculator and its e help book pay and time off work for parents doesnt mention it either the ruling is mentioned in e supplement pay and time off work for parents special cases which is included on the cdrom but not every employer will have read it especially as e describes special cases as agency staff casual workers and mariners for anyone who thinks it unlikely that an employer would miss this vital information i am proof that underpayments can and do happen having noticed that my own smp didnt include an annual pay rise effective from february this year i queried the amount and discovered that my employers payroll company had used the hmrc calculator to arrive at my erroneous smp figure shortchanging me by about this londonbased company is now concerned enough to review every smp calculation it has provided to clients over the past year knowing there will probably be other mistakes hmrc insists it would be impossible to set up the smp calculator to take pay rises into account and points out that no other agency has managed to do so it also suggests that employers seeking information on this subject should contact the department of work and pensions which sets policy on smp the dwp website under the advisers section helpfully gives chapter and verse on the ecj ruling and its application but we would refer employers looking for information on smp to the department of trade and industry says a spokesman the dti does indeed provide smp information to employers distributed to employers through acas and the confederation of british industry but its leaflet on employees maternity rights dates from and even the more uptodate website fails to mention the crucial payrise ruling but this doesnt matter because employers get their information on how to calculate smp from hmrc not from us says a spokesman so its back to square one the good news is that any woman who received smp during the past year and thinks she might have been underpaid can request that her employer recalculate payment due taking any relevant pay rise into account and subsequently claim any discrepancy women who did not qualify for smp because their earnings were too low but who would have qualified had the pay rise been included in the smp calculation can also claim the difference between the smp that should have been paid and the maternity allowance they received the ecjs ruling was not intended to be retrospective so women who took maternity leave before april will not be automatically covered but the dwp says any woman who took maternity leave can make a claim for arrears within six years of smp being paid be warned though that employers are obliged to keep smp records for three years only if your employer no longer has records of what was paid during your smp period the burden of proving underpayment will fall on you know your rights all pregnant women are entitled to paid time off for antenatal care including parenting and relaxation classes they are also entitled to weeks ordinary maternity leave irrespective of how long they have worked for their employer any woman who has worked for her employer continuously for at least weeks can further claim up to weeks additional maternity leave all new mothers must take at least two weeks maternity leave following the birth of their baby smp is payable for up to weeks to women who have been employed by their employer for at least weeks up to and including their qualifying week th week before the week in which the baby is due and who earn at least as much as the lower earnings limit for national insurance women who dont qualify for smp may qualify for maternity allowance instead during ordinary maternity leave employment is considered to be continuous so employees can still claim their usual annual leave and their pension entitlements are unaffected women returning to the workplace are entitled to request flexible working arrangements and employers are obliged to seriously

clare dyer rightly highlights the concern that services for complainants of sexual assault are becoming increasingly disparate across the uk with many police forces outsourcing these services to commercial companies that employ overseas doctors with little experience or commitment to the work evidencegathering in rape cases in crisis doctors warn may the new faculty of forensic and legal medicine which has been established by the royal college of physicians shares this concern although the number of reported rapes represents only a tiny proportion of all recorded crimes the severity of its impact on victims and the fear of the crime give it major importance within the criminal justice system the marked decline in the percentage of successful prosecutions for rape offences which in the uk has dropped from in to in is therefore a cause for serious concern while there are many causes for the unacceptably high attrition rates one of these is unquestionably the variable quality of medical evidence in court complainants of sexual assault are entitled to be examined by a forensic practitioner with the specialist knowledge skills and attitudes to gather evidence objectively impartially and with compassion anything less than this can rightly be considered further abuse it is clearly unacceptable for a complainant to be examined by a doctor whose command of english is so poor that he can communicate with neither the complainant nor the jury as dyer reported nor can it be right that two adolescent girls should be examined by a locum doctor who normally works as an orthopaedic registrar and who has no theoretical or practical experience of dealing with victims of sexual assaults but not only must doctors be competent to examine complainants of sexual assault they must also have the training and experience to understand the pitfalls of giving expert evidence in court and be able to express highquality opinions that are evidencebased and free of dogma clearly doctors also need to be in this country and not their homelands in order to give evidence at present there is no formal specialist recognition within the medical establishment for those who practise forensic and legal medicine such as forensic physicians who examine rape victims key objectives for our faculty are to obtain such recognition and ensure the highest professional standards of competence and ethical integrity it must become unacceptable for outsourced companies to provide services without appropriate specialist support the home office in recognising the importance of improving forensic and healthcare provision to the police service has provided us with support and resources it is to be hoped that those police forces which outsource forensic medical services share these views and ensure that providers employ doctors with the appropriate expertise and experience if not there is a real danger of the innocent being convicted and the guilty going free dr guy

there was just a telling moment in the qampa session at last nights guardian debate you can listen to it in two parts here and here several hundred people had gathered to discuss how to develop a new sexual manifesto a way to counter the oversexualisation of modern culture a female audiencemember put forward the thesis that raunch culture described by writer ariel levy in her book female chauvinist pigs as the sudden popularity for lap dancers pole dancing and leering and beering among women was all mens fault it was a symptom of our patriarchal society and mens rampant desire for female flesh was to blame if men were not in the market for these degrading images of women they wouldnt exist in the first place sex sells because its what men want women dress in short skirts because its what men want women go to lapdancing clubs because it is a place men like to go in raunch culture liberation and empowerment for women involves behaving like a man but who decided that these are the only types of sexuality that men are interested in who decided that behaving like a man involves going to lapdancing clubs or salivating over porn stars who decided that men are all beholden to the fantasy world of boobs and beer with an unstoppable desire for sexual prowess the current sexual climate caricatures mens sexuality and damages men the blame for this lies in many places but nowhere is the roots of this problem clearer than in the pernicious world of lad culture heres a phenomenon that through its media the lad magazine supposedly gives young men the confidence they need an insight into the skills for a successful romantic life and an understanding of what women find attractive but in reality these magazines simply try to convince men that their lives are somehow filled with grave problems your job is not exciting enough you dont know the right things to say you certainly dont dress well enough and certainly you dont know how to attract women fortunately the same magazines can give you all the answers tips on how to dress what to drink what aftershave to splash on how to behave if you want women to think you are a real man lad culture not only promotes the unashamed pursuit of women as the only way to prove yourself as a man it also distorts the image young men have of themselves lad culture wants men to internalise this simple message you are worthless is it this behaviour and the subsequent caricature of sexuality that the fans of raunch culture want to emulate any new sexual manifesto has to tackle this gross distortion of masculinity women have their own task to reclaim feminism from those who think that lap dancing is empowerment and liberation men have a pressing task too to break out of the straitjacket that lad culture has locked us into those of us offended by the objectification of male sexuality must stand up and shout just as loudly as the proponents of lad culture that men should never have to bow down to the rules and ideals set down by magazines that want nothing from us but our money and dignity lynne segal a professor psychology and gender studies at birkbeck college and a panelist at last nights debate said that feminists have been here at the point of campaigning against the gross oversexualisation of society in the s just before their attempts to ban pornography but somehow other issues took over and their concerns over the sexualisation were sidelined whats to say this will not happen again simply blaming men for the problem is too easy too crass the answer must be to look at mens sexuality as part of the problem by empowering men to stand up against negative expectations placed upon them the outcome of the debate might be different this time around,2006-06,wa telling

there are no lads mags in syria the women who peer down from billboards are fully clothed and there is certainly no pornography available at the local corner store yet the young men on the streets are as horny as their cousins in the west chattering endlessly about girls gawping and swapping explicit photos via mobile phone the lessons from a sexually conservative society are that the more you try to contain the pressure from insistent hormones the worse it becomes at the same time its clear from our experiences in the west that a rampant freeforall or what sometimes approaches it also doesnt work the truth about hour raunch culture is that when the temperature all around you is rising your own temperature rises too better of course not to ban any material but not to promote any material but thats not the real world in the real world explicit lingerie and cropped tops and lowslung jeans with obligatory thong all sell and sell big but promote a misguided message especially to young women they provide a mistaken minimum role model to those most susceptible to it you can be a doctor or a writer or an architect they suggest but you must at least be up for it anything less is to deny yourself your freedoms as a woman in any case theres a logic of the market to scantily dressed women in advertising namely that it works which is why conservative governments seek to ban it altogether after all where do you draw the line an attractive woman fully clothed with an ambiguous smile partial nudity nudity but no nipples the logic of censorship would seek to put someone in charge of our moral boundaries and the idea of john reid sifting through photos of semiclad women with his black marker is not one that appeals and actually there is an answer or a partial one now that most governments seem to have made their decision on markets deciding its up to communities to take back responsibility for their social mores the first step is to take control searching for political solutions to commercial realities seems like a mismatch of tools women and men already have the tools at their disposal to decide what is acceptable to them it is after all women who buy womens magazines with airbrushed perfect women women who buy lingerie sold to them by anorexic models women who buy the makeup because theyre worth it that isnt to say we dont have to play our part the commodification of womens bodies harms men as well not just our sisters and daughters but it is women who wield the strongest economic leverage over companies women who through boycotts or

judith still finds it hard to believe it happened in a blur one night in may after a long night of partying she remembers being very drunk then starting the journey back to her room a student residence in aberystwyth west wales then being awake a long time later in the corridor outside her room and realising that someone was by her clearly attempting sex and then later much later realising that someone had actually had sex with her and knowing that she would not have consented to sex in a corridor or at least she did not remember and if she did not remember what on earth was someone anyone doing having trying to have sex with her it was rape when the case came to court the story made headlines around the world caused argument and comment in pubs in legal circles and at the highest levels of government the outcome played a key part in overhauling the law the yearold drama undergraduate judith is not her real name became a cause clbre her allegation was that she was attacked by a fellow student at aberystwyth university a man who was working as a parttime security guard and had been asked by a member of university staff to walk her home but after admitting under crossexamination that she could not remember if she had refused or given consent for sex the prosecution offered no further evidence drunken consent is still consent the judge said he instructed the jury at swansea crown court last november to return a verdict of not guilty even he told them if you dont agree the student alleged to have attacked judith was yearold ruairi dougal after the case collapsed he issued a statement saying he emphatically denied that he had sexual intercourse without judiths knowledge and consent ruairi dougal has always maintained that the complainant did consent to sexual intercourse at all stages and that she was fully conscious when intercourse occurred said his solicitor david james the clear implication of the judges statement that women could not complain of being raped if they were too drunk to remember what happened thrust judith into the centre of a legal and media storm from some in the media she faced condemnation for being a ladette who had behaved with culpable irresponsibility devastated by the combination of the attack the court case and the very public backlash judith has agreed to tell her story for the first time there are still days where i will just completely break down and just scream and cry she says i still cant quite believe that all this has actually happened to me with the benefit of hindsight i can honestly say that the way i was treated in court was more traumatic than the attack itself they made me feel worthless and cheap the prosecution barrister told me that by admitting i couldnt remember refusing consent id made it look as if id been so drunk that i couldnt remember whether i had consented or not he said that therefore the assumption was that i must have consented the interview will broadcast tonight by the bbcs panorama programme i was the journalist who conducted the interviews for the programme part of an investigation into the chronically low rape conviction rate i was approached by the bbc after a series of articles in the observer revealed how difficult it was to gain rape convictions the programme comes after another week when rape is in the news a home office report published last week revealed that a government initiative introduced six years ago to increase the conviction rate and stop defence barristers depicting rape victims as promiscuous has been evaded circumvented and resisted judith says the present law is simply dysfunctional and believes her case sent out a message that people can get away with their crimes she also argues that the law fails to protect victims and is acutely concerned by the lesson attackers will she says learn from her case the whole experience left me feeling violated i had been so honest that i wouldnt even let my mum in the courtroom because i said some horrific very personal things that even my family didnt know but it just felt like the court had decided i was just some stupid drunk girl whod brought it upon herself theres no deterrent for rapists if anything the law seems to protect them what kind of message are you sending if a case as strong as mine gets thrown out over a simple turn of phrase her suspicion is backed by some of britains highest legal and police figures that judge was wrong to give the ruling he did and obviously that is very concerning his reading of the law might well not be unique said john yates deputy assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police and the director of serious and organised crime for the capitals police force mike obrien the solicitorgeneral said he was so disturbed by judiths case that it became his touchstone when drawing up a consultation paper shortly afterwards that aimed to strengthen the legal framework around rape help reduce the barriers to effective prosecution and improve the care for victims and witnesses the paper is due to be published in the autumn the issue of capacity particularly where a woman has drunk alcohol should be clearly defined he said arguing that while he was not suggesting guilt on the part of dougal the jury should have been allowed to decide whether or not the woman had been capable of giving consent while drunk these matters ought in future to be properly put before the jury and the jury should be able to make up its mind whether that victim was in a position to give effective consent or not rather than having the prosecutor withdraw the case or the judge withdrawing it tonights panorama tracks the cases of three women who fought to put their alleged rapists in the dock one says she was bullied and humiliated by a policewoman into dropping her claim while another was told by the crown prosecution service that a minor discrepancy in her witness statements made her case too weak to take to court judith whose case was one of the per cent of all reported allegations that go to trial says her experience of court was so traumatic that if she were in the same position again she would be extremely unlikely to turn to the law it is not the first time panorama has dealt with this issue in a seminal film transformed the way that rape investigations were conducted in britain roger graef and charles stewarts documentary a complaint of rape showed thames valley police officers interviewing a woman who claimed she had been raped by two men she had met in a pub graef has returned to the subject to direct this new investigation filmed with the full knowledge of the officers involved the eighties documentary revealed a police force told that the majority of rape complaints were false they were trained to test such claims rigorously at the earliest stage in a manner that was intimidating humiliating and terrifying for victims as a direct result of that documentary rape crisis centres were developed and police were retrained to handle complainants with respect and an initial presumption of belief improvements have continued the sexual offences act clarified the law on consent sexual assault referral centres have been set up across england and wales with six more in the pipeline but why is the conviction rate for rape at an alltime low in complaints of rape were made and one in four men were convicted in the latest figures available complaints were made but just one in men were convicted the evening had begun as a celebration id been studying hard for my exams but my department was doing a leaving party so i got dressed up judith said i had a couple of drinks before i went and then we all had a big photo outside the arts building where the party was all my good friends were there and everybody was taking pictures signing year books and saying oh im going to miss you so much a friend brought me another couple of glasses of wine but i didnt finish the second because id already begun to feel ill and drunk if i feel ill i would normally just go home but everything just seemed to be so unclear that night after a while i felt so bad that i actually had to go and be sick the vomit somehow ended up on my dress and after that i decided i really didnt want to be there any more or have anybody see me in such a state i went outside and this woman who worked at the venue said im going to get somebody to walk you home i was quite insistent i wanted to walk home by myself because it was a fiveminute walk across campus and not dangerous at all but she went off to get somebody when she came back with a man she said this is soandso and hes going to walk you home and i said ok judith confesses she doesnt remember anything about the walk admitting that now makes her ashamed she recollects getting out her keys outside the halls of residence but then cant remember walking into the halls or up the stairs to her flat the next thing i know im lying outside my flat door on the floor with part of my shoulder and my head up against the wall i see a dark figure at my feet and then i think i must have fallen unconscious again when i wake up again hes still standing over me again i cant see his face or anything like that and he ejaculates on me which horrifies me but i dont understand whats happening dougal has insisted judith was fully conscious during sex and did consent revisiting her memory is difficult for judith and she stops momentarily unable to continue visibly struggling to regain control she pushes her shoulders back sits up straighter and taking a deep breath continues then he leaves and i pick up my keys and i just open my flat door and collapse in a heap on my bed on top of all my books when she woke up next morning she had no memory of events of the evening before but as soon as i walked out of my flat i got a flashback of him standing over me i just didnt understand i couldnt put it all together judith had a lecture that morning so she tried to put her broken recollection out of her mind but in the lecture slowly everything started to become a bit less blurred and i started thinking has something happened to me after the lecture she returned to her flat and broke down in tears i told my flatmate i think somethings happened to me i didnt know what to do she decided to press charges thinking she had been sexually assaulted police and medical staff dealt with her sensitively it was only after the medical examination results came back that she was told that someone had had sexual intercourse with her i knew i had to tell my mum but when i called her i couldnt speak i was just consumed with grief and the policewoman had to tell her for me my mum came straight up to see me but its a sixhour drive so the policewoman stayed with me she kept giving me cups of tea and making sure i wouldnt do anything stupid because when youre told something like you just dont want to be alive i did blame myself not entirely i mean deep down with something like that you know its not your fault but you think about how others would see it and you reckon theyre going to think she was drunk she asked for it but as far as i know getting drunk isnt a crime the people at the party could obviously see i was in such a state i had to be escorted home if i was in that much of a state it must have been clear to anyone that i was incapable of consenting to anything i was put into his care for him to ensure that i got home safely he was the thing i should have been kept safe from when the trial date was fixed judith knew a tough path was ahead of her i still didnt know whether mentally id be able to handle going through a court case which involved travelling six hours back to the court nearest the university but i had to force myself because i didnt want him to be able to do it again i didnt want to go to court for myself i just wanted to make sure he couldnt do it to anyone else it was during her second day of evidence that judith already denied screens to shield her from her alleged attacker felt the full force of the justice system operate against her it was she says one of the most traumatic experiences of her life the defence asked me question after question and said things that made me so angry he said it was steamy and passionate sex that i had grabbed the mans crotch and seduced him he kept asking me the same question about consent but it seemed that whatever i answer i gave him he wasnt satisfied because he would rephrase the question and ask again i kept telling him that i didnt remember the events clearly because i was unconscious but that i knew i hadnt consented to sex i told him that i knew i was unconscious because i remembered repeatedly waking up i told him it was precisely because it was so obvious to everyone that i was so incapable even of walking home that that man had been put in charge of me i told him that if i was incapable of walking home i was incapable seducing anyone or of consenting to anything but however many times i explained it he just kept trying to make me agree that i couldnt possibly say definitely that i had not given my consent because i couldnt remember he kept badgering me and i got more and more confused i kept trying to give him the same answer until in the end i agreed i couldnt remember but that was just a bad choice of words i couldnt believe it when afterwards i was told those three words led to the case being thrown out after her admission huw rees the prosecuting barrister said he could not go on with the case he told the judge the question of consent is an essential part of the case she said she could not remember giving consent and that is fatal for the prosecutions case it is the intention of the prosecution to offer no further evidence the judge not only agreed with reess decision but attacked the crown prosecution service for bringing the case in my view and it is only a personal view he said there was never any prospect of a conviction in this case judith still feels the decision by the prosecution barrister to drop her case seems like an act of sabotage when he told me he had abandoned the case and that it had been dropped as a result i just cried and cried the prosecution barrister kept repeating that it was because of what i had said in court it really felt like he was blaming me the impact on judith was enormous i couldnt stop crying for weeks it just kept going round in my head my mum kept telling me i had to let it go but i couldnt i kept saying cant we do something else get him prosecuted some other way id go to bed and be awake for hours beating myself up because i hadnt been a stronger witness judiths case struck such a raw public and political nerve because the law had only recently been changed to toughen it up over the issue of consent the sexual offences act which came into force in states that permission for sex can not legally be given if a person is subjected to violence detained against their will is asleep or unconscious or has been unknowingly drugged but crucially for judith the act says nothing about a victim being too drunk to consent influential bodies such as the law commission had advised the government to include such an alcohol clause but the home secretary at the time david blunkett dismissed that idea because he said we do not want mischievous accusations being made in circumstances where someone genuinely believed that they had reasonable and honest belief of consent his decision was criticised by campaigners for justice in rape cases who maintained that false allegations were in fact rare their stance was justified soon afterwards when a report commissioned by the home office itself found that malicious allegations make up fewer than per cent of all the claims made but by then it was too late to amend the act officials said jennifer temkin professor of law at the university of sussex is coauthor of last weeks report revealing how the recent law designed to improve the situation is having little impact she says cases such as judiths fail because of fundamental problems with the way the legal system is structured we have this adversarial court system in criminal cases that means the defence counsels strategy has to revolve around undermining the complainants character she says sometimes this is done in a very heavyhanded way by dragging in her sexual past sometimes more subtly but it doesnt matter which way its done the strategy is to suggest to the jury that this woman is not entirely credible kirsty brimelow a barrister who defends men accused of rape says she routinely uses this approach destroying the witnesss credibility by putting to them that they are making something up is key to your defendants case she says you have to do that the balance always has to be to ensure that innocent people dont go to prison and in an adversarial court system you have to question the witness as robustly as possible she says changing the law would make it more likely that innocent people would go to prison if you change the standard of proof just to get a conviction if you skip out the evidential stage just to get a conviction you will have innocent people probably sitting in prison for years for something they havent done temkin is adamant this robust questioning can easily go too far when i interviewed barristers for a recent study a qc who had represented countless rape defendants said its terribly easy to defend in a rape case because it is so emotional for the witness and she is so nervous its easy to undermine her credibility in the eyes of the jury so easy that he began to feel terribly uncomfortable and no longer does these cases she says two days after judiths case hit the headlines last november amnesty international published a report into attitudes toward rape in the uk one third of those surveyed said they believed women who flirt are partly at fault if someone rapes them a third saw women as being partially or wholly responsible for being raped if they were intoxicated and more than a quarter thought women invited rape to some extent if they wore seductive clothing in addition almost per cent thought a woman would be partly responsible for being raped if it was suggested she had slept around and per cent thought a promiscuous woman would be totally responsible if she was raped they were findings that vera baird a junior minister in the department for constitutional affairs finds profoundly depressing at the moment the only kind of rape complainant whos likely to succeed is an archbishops wife with a totally blameless life and none of us truly are like that so how would we fare in the witness box many experts are privately voicing their concerns that the criminal law adversarial in nature is incapable of dealing with rape so much has been done in recent years to try to help rape victims they say but raising the volume of rapes reported is not much use if the conviction rate continues to tumble this weekend judith arrived back from holiday in greece the first she has taken on her own life is slowly moving on but the night that she lived so much in a blur will always be with her the night she says she was raped the night she started a long and ultimately fruitless journey to face her accuser in court and get some sort of justice panorama goes out at tonight caught on camera this is part of the remarkable dialogue from roger graefs documentary a complaint of rape filmed in a thames valley police station two officers interview a woman alleging she had been gangraped by men had she met in a pub first policeman ive been sitting or minutes listening to you some of its the biggest

the number of dads making a contribution to childcare has increased eightfold in the last generation say new figures from the equal opportunities commission yet in most relationships its still the woman who takes on the caring responsibilities when a couple have kids and for many mums that means accepting deadend lowskilled roles because theyre the only ones that let them work flexibly mothers are often forced to work at lower levels than theyre qualified for says marion davies of loneparent charity one plus there are situations where they go for employment because its flexible rather than because its suitable she explains a lot of lone parents will do this because they want to get back into the labour market and then theres a lot of frustration because they cant move forward they hope theyll get a better job eventually but they can be waiting a long time just under half of all jobs in retail for instance are filled by women working parttime these positions were created specifically to attract female workers but jobs where women have some flexibility still tend to be concentrated in the lower grades of the industry says usdaw the union for shopworkers which is campaigning to raise the status of parttime work though its supporting parents and carers campaign theres an unwritten requirement that middle and senior jobs have to be done on a fulltime basis and over long working hours says the unions equalities officer jo bird but there is a more subtle thing going on too an assumption that because jobs are parttime the people who do them arent committed and dont really have any skills and ive had women tell me that theyve been going through the management training process but as soon as they get pregnant theres an assumption that theyre not committed and wont be aiming for management any more but can highly responsible senior jobs be done flexibly around family commitments according to carol savage chief executive and founder of flexecutive which advises on parttime working the answer is a qualified yes i believe you can do every job on a flexible basis it just depends on the kind of flexibility youre talking about receptionists for instance cant work at home but you can jobshare that position she says if you can only do five hours in the middle of the day then i think thats the hardest to make work in a managerial role the easiest way for mums to work at a senior level is to do two or three full days rather than am to pm over five days at usdaw jo bird wryly notes that since men have started asking for more flexibility in their working conditions things have gradually started to get better for women too its about redesigning jobs through a creative approach to work dawn gascoigne is a franchisee and independent travel consultant for travel counsellors mum to two young girls she built up years experience in the travel business working for thomas cook but left months ago to set up on her own when she realised that while the company would allow her to work parttime it would not consider a more flexible approach to managing her working hours being the manager of a whole travel agency means that everything is solely your responsibility and i took that very seriously indeed if anything went wrong on my day off id forfeit the time and go in i didnt want to have to do that with a growing family so i went back as a parttime sales consultant on less than half my salary it was mostly fine at first but when you have children things do come up and if you cant work with your employer around them it can get stressful i felt strongly that some of my work could be done remotely and i literally begged thomas cook to let me work evenings at home but they said theyd trialled it before and it hadnt worked i had to accept that despite being sure i could manage it fine i know now through being an independent consultant for travel counsellors that it does work very well for my clients and there is a place in this highly competitive market for it it was such a little thing that made me realise that if i couldnt work flexibly in a high street agency i had to find a way to do it for myself id not been able to get time off to see my daughter run in a pancake day race i decided that my family needed the flexibility of me being able to work around these things it was a risk to go selfemployed because its all on commission but now i can do evenings when the girls are in bed and hours in the day when theyre at school i dont very often work at weekends compared with the high street agencies that dictate that you have to but when you have a family weekends are very precious im four times better off now than i was before and with less stress i do think it is possible to have children and to stay senior but if your child is sick or you have a pancake day to go to thats frowned upon and that causes stress if you want a balance that kind of work doesnt offer it at the moment and its a shame because there are a huge number of mums with huge amounts of experience and dedication but who just cant do the all or nothing karen coles from south wales had her five children over an year period before deciding last autumn that she wanted to enter the world of work she began with two weeks of work experience through the marks amp start scheme a community initiative run by marks amp spencer to support people who face barriers of various kinds in getting a job the company says that it is committed to offering flexible working at all levels id really wanted to go back to work for a while but i just felt worthless and to tell you the truth i was scared of going into a workplace the first day i went in i was so anxious i didnt think i could face going back i was so nervous of meeting new people i did a placement first where they team you up with a buddy who helps you through it i did feel a bit shaky but as the two weeks on i got more confident at the end i was feeling really good like i was worth something so i applied for a temporary job behind a till with hours from ampm i got that job and did it for six months theyve just taken me on permanent which feels great i do shifts working pmpm for four days a week and my eldest boy whos looks after the littler ones im better off now than i was on benefit probably by about or a week i feel times better about myself too and the kids are proud of me i think until my youngest is at school im happy to work these hours but i know at marks amp spencer that you can move up and be a line manager or a trainer and still work parttime or do restricted hours while earning more in a better job elise danson name changed has a yearold son and works parttime in an amusement arcade she has just had to turn down a promotion because of the working hours it would have required id left one job already because of the unreasonable hours they ended up wanting me to do i was the supervisor of the arcade in that job but now im a cashier and the money isnt nearly as good i work four hours a day now to fit in with getting my boy to school id been at this new job just a few weeks when they offered me the chance of being manageress the pay was a lot better probably a week more and that kind of money would make a big difference to us i could improve a lot of things on that wage but it meant working long shifts four days a week and i just couldnt this industry doesnt really let you work parttime in that sort of job to be honest i think getting a betterpaid job on parttime hours is just going to be one of those impossible things,2006-06,number dad

an obsession with the stripped self is sold today as semaphoring liberated female sexuality writes angela phillips there is nothing in these vapid air brushed pictures that says anything about female desire she argues they are all about male desire desire or power the new debate about raunch culture and its bed partner a sexualised consumerism apparently determined to turn tots into spendthrift tarts how many playboy pencil cases pole dancing classes and pushup bras does a girl small medium or large actually need is paradoxically so oldfashioned old because no matter how much women revealing all believe they are behaving of their own free will contrary to what ariel levy argues they are still imprisoned in a cage constructed by the patriarchy one which ironically also imprisons many men just as surely as it constrained in different ways their virginal straightlaced sisters a hundred years ago the fact that some today cant see the bars isnt anyones fault but it does tell us that without an active sense of vigilance and the ability to analyse how and why female selfconsciousness has been exploited for centuries then feminism is easily reduced to an elegy on a gstring and the cheap and illusionary thrill of girls behaving badly ways of seeing was written by john berger years ago the ways we see things he pointed out is affected by what we see and what we know he described a woman in vanity a painting by the th century artist hans meling on the surface she fulfils all the criteria that according to writer ariel levy merit the label female chauvinist pig defined as women who make sex objects of other women and themselves hans memlings woman stands brazenly and unabashedly naked in the middle of a field how raunchy is that shorn of pubic hair a medieval brazilian admiring herself in a mirror how bold can you go then berger points out that at that time the pubic hair was shorn by male artists because it denoted potency and passion they men who paid for these paintings wanted women supine submissive and childlike any parallels with the huge surge in interest in internet child pornography women are there to feed an appetite not have one of their own berger wrote the mirror often used in art as the symbol of female vanity underlining a womans selfconsciousness and the importance of beauty rather than brains also reminded the world of a womans place in it the real function of the mirror was to make woman connive in treating herself as first and foremost a sight berger explains in an oftenrepeated quote he says men act and women appear men look at women women watch themselves being looked at this determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves if that doesnt ring any bells then perhaps the following might to be born a woman berger suggested is to be born into an allotted and confined space into the keeping of men the social presence of women has developed as a result of their ingenuity in living under such tutelage within such a limited space from earliest childhood she has been and persuaded to survey herself continually all of which can be witnessed daily on what is at present two highly visible allotted and confined spaces namely the big brother house overflowing with females pretending to be comfortable in their cosmetically acquired skin but failing with various degrees of misery and the daily trouping of the colour performed by the wags wives and girlfriends of the english football team in germany while the men and thousands of envious twentysomething females watch of course the position of women has changed but conditioning runs deep and we are a time of transition young women may act sexy but how many really feel it without the benefit of booze so instead of genuinely developing their own appetites they opt for burlesque the debate about female sexual exhibitionism and what it signals is based on a couple of assumptions its what all men want and most younger women participate in it neither is true change and progress is a messy business three steps forward two back three and a half forward so while many females my say they think they are too fat too flawed too imperfect they get on with their lives for all anyone knows having deeply satisfying erotic encounters happily with strangers of even monogamously with their partner of years without the paraphernalia of raunch of course there are also men out there too who are interested in female desire as apposed to what they think females desire falsely tutored by nuts and jordan in poses caught in a time warp somewhere in the s men who know that sex is all in the head and that how you see women influences how you treat them cause for optimism also comes from older women reared during years when sex was deemed dirty many say their sex lives have never been better perhaps because they have begun to step outside their allotted space lost their selfconsciousness and like some men developed an appetite of their own angela phillips rightly describes how teenagers are having sex younger and often regret it and that sex education in british schools is still based too much on sex and not enough on an education in selfconfidence mutual respect and relationships yet school isnt the only source of information research shows a large proportion of teenagers do have a strong connection with their parents and can and do talk about emotions and handle their relationships with surprising maturity even those teenage girls who to quote angela say innit womens equality or the lack of it as reflected in pay who does what in the home and who runs the establishment remains a goal not a reality in the uk and is virtually nonexistent in the developing world where raunchiness of course in the shape of sex tourism is a major industry in that context the question of whether a woman pole dances or not narrows the vision we cant have social justice so well have sex publicly

in after six years of researching writing and updating a book called the facts of rape i decided i was never going to tackle anything again that i couldnt joke about but years on with abysmal conviction rates for rape again in the news i was struck by a shocking comparison in cases of rape were recorded by police in england and wales the same year men either admitted they were guilty or were found guilty of the crime between april and march the total number of rapes of women by men recorded by police in england and wales was in just either admitted the crime or were subsequently found guilty of it thats over more reported crimes than in but only a few hundred more convictions in one in three reported rapes ended in convictions in one in not only were the figures astonishing they were depressing beyond belief did they mean rape was out of control and the system even less equipped to deal with it or that the thousands of women who wouldnt have reported the crime in were now reporting it but were even less likely to see their assailants punished the answer had to lie somewhere in the chain of events between the crime and the jury returning its verdict the most obvious place to start looking for it was the crown court on a horrible monday in december last year i went to southwark south london in search of a trial where the complainant and the defendant were known to each other and where the case hinged on the issue of her consent these are the critical features in the vast majority of rape allegations and years ago they were also the reasons most never got to court or if they did were most likely to end in an acquittal my plan was to work backwards to use the trial as a springboard into the system to see exactly what was happening to create the awful state of affairs suggested by the statistics i chose court only because it was a single defendant and the charge was rape this is the story of an allegation made on april and its outcome nine months later im calling the complainant a and the man she accused b im not naming the barristers or judge either because they asked me not to april was a thursday some time between am and am b who is in his mids and weighs stone dragged a in her late s and nine stone up the stairs of her house in south london to her bedroom on the first floor he pushed her inside and locked the door she pleaded with him she said she had her period but b pushed her back on to the bed pulled her pyjama bottoms off then got on top of her a struggled to free herself she said she would scream and other people in the house would hear her but b put a pillow over her face and said if she didnt shut up hed kill her when he had finished he ran out of the house jumped into his car and sped away a went down to the kitchen found her phone then went back to the living room and sat on the settee she hadnt been able to speak when a lodger in the kitchen had asked her if she was ok the phone rang her nephew who lived nearby with his girlfriend had heard the sound of the car and looked out of his window aware that a was frightened of b he wanted to know if she was all right she told him b had raped her he arrived at the house within minutes and then fetched his girlfriends mother mrs c who also lived nearby she called the police five hours later b was arrested on the building site where he was working he agreed he and a had had sex she had consented to it he said he had gone to the house having telephoned in advance to collect some tools she had made him a cup of tea he had kissed her and she hadnt objected she had suggested they go upstairs to talk so they wouldnt wake anyone else in the house they had started to have sex but stopped because she was having a period hed left in a hurry because he was late for work and that was why she was angry until two weeks previously a and b had lived as man and wife they had been partners for years she had thrown him out after he had made sexual advances towards one of their lodgers and she didnt want him back now here they were in southwark crown court in front of a jury of eight men and four women whose job it was to decide if he was the rapist she said he was and there i was thinking forget it it was her word against his there was no physical evidence of injury or of resistance they had had consensual sex weeks earlier and probability wasnt going to come into it the jury would have to be sure the judge would tell them both defence and prosecuting counsel would tell them that if they werent sure b was guilty they must acquit him in the case wouldnt even have got to court rape between a husband and wife wasnt a crime until even if they had had no prior sexual relationship it is doubtful the police would have prosecuted because juries were warned not to convict on a complainants uncorroborated evidence it seemed to me a miracle that a was in the courtroom at all even if the british crime survey found that of rapists were current or former partners or boyfriends of victims but it soon became clear that both the investigative and legal processes were infinitely kinder to the victim than they had been in the corroboration requirement had been dropped in section of the youth justice and criminal evidence act of had outlawed the cynical use of a complainants sexual history although this week a report sponsored by the home office found this still occurs and the sexual offences act had addressed the problems of consent both what it was and what a reasonable belief in it might be according to a crown prosecution service directive a person consents if he or she agrees by choice to the sexual activity and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice all the circumstances at the time of the offence will be looked at in determining whether the defendant is reasonable in believing the complainant consented people will be considered most unlikely to have agreed to sexual activity if they were subject to threats or fear of serious harm unconscious drugged abducted or unable to communicate because of a physical disability as argument was that she had had sex with b because she was terrified and he had persisted despite her protests bs was that he had had no reason to believe a wasnt consenting the prosecuting barrister established the facts in his opening address which was based on as videotaped interview with a sexual offences investigative techniques soit officer on the day she made the allegation soits were introduced to sexual offence investigations by londons metropolitan police as part of its sapphire programme launched in to provide a better deal for the victim and a higher standard of investigation in police officers both women and men were notoriously brutal with complainants on the basis that any crossexamination in court would be even more so in i soon discovered specialisation is favoured throughout the system for crown solicitors and barristers doctors and judges as well as the police the crown barrister a yearold family man called to the bar years ago was issued with a licence to prosecute sexual offences in when the cps overhauled its system and created rape specialists in its own offices the trial judge who had been appointed to the high court in was invited to join the panel who can try sexual offences in only the defence counsel an unmarried man in his s with years at the bar had no special accreditation although sexual offences accounted for one in four of his cases the crowns case was clear prosecuting counsel told court that monday it was agreed that intercourse had taken place but a said it wasnt consensual and several elements proved it was not b put a pillow over as face a was menstruating a threatened to scream b dragged her up the stairs and locked the door behind them but central to the case was the breakup of the relationship which he intended to chart a prosecuting counsel said had gone on holiday to tenerife with her daughterinlaw and when she had returned her son had told her that b had made advances to one of their lodgers she had called a halt to the marriage b had moved out of the area but on april had moved back to stay with as daughter his stepdaughter all the while he was telephoning a on both her mobile and her landline saying he wanted to get back together if not he would kill himself or her the phone calls werent disputed b said a had phoned him too on april at am he had gone round to the family house and tried as locked bedroom door she had let him in at her daughter had phoned because b had left her house she had hurried over when she discovered b was with her mother because she was worried b had threatened to smash the house up and burn it down he had collected some tools he needed a had asked him to return his keys to the house and he had but a had realised that a key to the patio door was missing and asked her nephew to change the bolts on april b had gone to the house again to collect more tools there had been a heated exchange but later he had asked for forgiveness a had told him the marriage was over on april he had phoned at am and arrived at the house an hour later he had raped her before the police had even arrived he had phoned her full of remorse it was a sorry story with only as distress to mark its horror but where a might never have been given the time of day in the current starting point with rape investigations is that the woman is telling the truth in london all rape reports go straight to the sapphire unit and a soit officer is appointed in as case this was dc dean harrison one of six in the greenwich unit which also has five specialist investigators dc harrison had taken a to the haven a sexual assault referral unit discreetly attached to kings hospital in camberwell where she had been seen by a crisis worker and by dr ruhi jawad the full time forensic gynaecologist the examination designed to preserve forensic evidence but also to reassure her had taken two hours the unit is as cosy as such a place can be a far cry from the police stations where examinations used to take place theres a sitting room and somewhere to shower and a change of clothing is available it receives referrals a month and dr jawad says when i visit her they preserve evidence even when the victim doesnt want to proceed in case she changes her mind after leaving the haven a had recorded her statement in the videoed interview with dc harrison this is standard procedure the interview can be used in court if the victim is unable to give evidence herself it had taken two hours next day dc ashley hayward from the greenwich domestic violence team had taken charge of the investigation and it was he who saw a through to the trials outcome my job was to build the case he tells me penetrative sex was admitted i had to rely a lot on as evidence and the supporting evidence b had been ordered out of the house the phone calls had been pestering corroboration might not be required but the jury would be looking for evidence to confirm as story there was the immediate complaint to her nephew the details of the rape she had described to mrs c as daughters evidence of the breakdown of the marriage the history of bs calls supported by phone records and the medical evidence of an injury to as vagina that might have been consistent with force it hadnt been enough to persuade the jury at an initial trial in july they had failed to reach a verdict so the judge had ordered a retrial this is why everyone was back in court in december the fact that a had had the strength to continue was a tribute to the way in which her case had been handled i thought but it was clear that this case was far from typical di paul meaden head of the greenwich sapphire unit talked me through a snapshot of rape allegations made to the met during april and may and where they stood by the following september of allegations made one of which was as were classified as crimes suspects were identified suspects were arrested cases were submitted to the cps and by september men had been charged some of the investigations were presumably ongoing but what had happened to the rest part of the problem in detection di meaden says is the number of cases involving drink a number of women who report crimes have a very limited memory of what happened because they were so drunk his personal view is that many more women are reporting rape because the police are more approachable but the problem now is not that they wont be believed but that the evidence wont be enough to satisfy someone along the line i put the attrition rate to claire ward a london cps rape specialist in consent cases we dont always prosecute but when we do prosecute we dont often get a conviction according to martin whitehouse head of the cps office that considered the evidence against b the test for the cps is not would a jury convict but could they even cases youre not sure about doesnt mean you dont prosecute you dont know in the end what juries are going to make of all these things the whole idea is that they bring to the jury room their experience of everyday life they bring their prejudices and all the rest of it we say that is the best way but it carries the risk that they will judge not strictly on the evidence by the third day of bs retrial i had no idea what the jury was making of the case against him defence counsel had pressed a to explain the extent of her struggle to resist he had asked her to explain in sexually explicit terms what had gone on they had listened to b give his evidence and insist that he had only ever wanted to repair his relationship and believed on that morning that he was doing so they must have wondered about the emphasis the prosecution placed on as period as if it were bizarre beyond belief that a woman might have sex while menstruating in summing up prosecuting counsel asked them to consider if a had had a motive to lie the big problem for the defence was that if b was telling the truth there was a huge level of connivance against him defence counsel had reminded them they had taken an oath to try the case on evidence the crown had tried to persuade them to try it on emotion the only evidence was of the unfortunate breakdown of a longstanding relationship there was no evidence of rape the judges direction to the jury weighed the cases point for point it was a matter for them but they must decide so that they were sure he sent them away to consider their verdict on the evidence at midday on wednesday at midday on thursday they returned their decision it was not unanimous a majority found b guilty five weeks later the judge taking into account as victim impact statement which described the violence in her marriage and the devastation of her life sentenced b to five years in jail physically she wasnt injured psychologically she was the judge noted dc hayward was a little disappointed five years is the starting point for rape convictions by this time a had changed her name moved house and had a panic button installed she had also written a letter of thanks to the police so what did the trial and outcome prove to me that bs conviction welcome though it was and cause for hope though it is was secured against ridiculous odds a had been helped every inch of the way by a sympathetic police force but there was no accounting for the result she had been lucky where most others are not a home office consultation paper called justice for victims of rape acknowledged the problem and considered ways of tackling it it considered changes to the rules of evidence the introduction of expert witnesses for the prosecution to testify to the emotional and psychological state of the complainant and the notion of capacity as it applied to victims who were drunk but none of the lawyers i spoke to could see any merit in further tinkering with the law the prosecuting counsel was thoroughly opposed to parliaments interference although he didnt believe the acquittal rate was a reflection of how many true cases were brought before the court he thought juries reached verdicts based on the rules brought before them there are things supra to the legislation the personalities of the barristers the personality of the judges and more especially the quality of the evidence as its presented in the witness box the defence counsel didnt think the conviction rate was abnormally or unfairly low if anything he said section jolts the scales of justice away from the defendant it restricts evidence concerning the character of the complainant specifically pertaining to a prior relationship between the accused and the complainant frequently there has been some form of relationship and this is relevant men are useless at reading women most rape allegations are made in a fog of misunderstanding when very often either or both parties are drunk the judge declared you can always understand when juries acquit why they acquitted although people are treated better there are better investigations it doesnt necessarily mean the defendants have got to be convicted it means more people are coming forward so that perhaps weaker cases are getting to a jury that would never have got there in the first place in it seemed to me that if the laws function was to influence behaviour and keep it within the limits of social acceptability nothing would change before it and its practice changed both have but social acceptability theres the problem the comments of the lawyers would seem to suggest that it is socially acceptable that in women reported they had been raped but only rapists warranted punishment and more significantly that the law and those who practise it not only cannot but should not attempt to influence it any further this must be nonsense when the crux of the problem is the way in which evidence is viewed it is all very well to say juries are doing the best they can with a difficult circumstance what needs to change is the climate in which the difficult circumstance is judged and that it seems to me should be thoroughly understood by the specialist whose influence must eventually have some impact on the fog of misunderstanding the trial judge who had handled the trial of b impeccably seemed perplexed when i suggested to him that women are far more likely to say yes to sexual intercourse when they mean no than the other way round admirable though innovations are to ensure a better deal for the victim the best deal she can get is justice specialisation can and should do more than produce a better working knowledge of the system and a sympathetic ear it can address the bias in attitudes to womens sexuality amnesty international reported last year that one in four in the uk believe women contribute to their own rape it can consider the impact of our happyslapping cultures growing brutalisation which allows a rapist and also a jury to believe that as attacks go his wasnt so bad di meaden provides a chilling perspective the interesting thing is how closely linked domestic violence and rape are the man who will commit rape is very much the man who will commit domestic violence they almost go hand in hand if youre willing to slap a woman youre willing to rape its just another form of abuse this month it was revealed that as few as of men convicted of domestic violence go to prison the wretched answer to the question i asked myself about the statistics is maybe maybe thousands of women who wouldnt have reported rape in are now reporting it because the system is kinder but according to the british crime survey tens of thousands more arent and this will be because the climate is not when the home office launched a campaign earlier this year alerting men to the novel concept of being sure of consent the daily mail ran a cartoon of two barristers standing by a bed with a man and a woman in it waving a contract because the

we need a new sexual manifesto that much is clear the objectification of womens bodies the corporate commitment to sex sells the pornification of the media and advertising that has even managed to seep into our individual sexual urges is depressing in its omnipotence in todays g the feminist writer ariel levy defends her use of the term female chauvinist pigs to describe the many women who not only accept this hypersexualised culture but actively promote and engage in it in their quest for a barbieinspired body in their visits to strip clubs in their lapdancing routines sure female chauvinist pigs isnt the perfect phrase to describe these women implying as it does an attack on women supposedly in need of defence but im inclined to think that this is the least of our worries whatever you call it lets say we are agreed that on the level of identification at least there is a problem as angela phillips argues on comment is free today young people grasping at notions of adulthood have always been easily influenced by what is around them is it any surprise that teenagers are having sex earlier when sex is all they see nevertheless some people will persist in interpreting this raunch culture as a form of female sexual freedom and evidence that we have won the sex war levy asks however when did we win the war we dont have equal pay for equal work we dont have equal representation in government so when exactly did we win we didnt win but that doesnt mean we have stopped trying and amid all this fighting talk it is dangerous to forget the actual fight the f word may have fallen out of fashion we are told with just one british female in four calling herself a feminist but last weekend in a small stuffy room in the basement of the central hall in westminster the existence not just of feminism but of ripples of its third wave was undeniable young and old female and male feminists representing different but complementary sets of beliefs gathered together at the compass conference for a seminar hosted by the gender equality campaign organisation the fawcett society entitled is this feminisms third wave the panel consisting of the founder of thefwordorguk catherine redfern the writer natasha walter and the academic haleh afshar sparked a dynamic and inspiring debate that left many of the other duller less wellattended seminars that day in the shade while the growing problem of our raunch culture was easily identified in a schoolteachers tale of her female pupils desperate to adorn themselves with pink in the women who only felt successful and equal if they conformed to sexual stereotypes the seminar floundered when coming up with ways to tackle it for how can you persuade a boy surrounded by pornographic images of women that he must not harass a woman on the street that a woman who wears a short skirt is not asking to be raped how can we strike a balance between individual sexual liberation and the mass marketisation of an industry that makes a ton of money trading on female body parts in essence how can you change society and bring about a cultural shift levy herself has disappointingly opted out of the challenge i am a writer not an activist she says i agree with her interviewer kira cochrane thats a pity what can written words on their own really achieve but in britain there is action as well as words small steps to challenge culture sexism are being made feminist blogs and online forums are flourishing fawcetts membership is surging and redfern spoke inspiringly of a range of grassroots activism lobbying and networking by young feminists across the county the anecdotes were incredibly heartening of local reclaim the night marches of brave individual attempts to challenge sexual stereotypes of consciousnessraising and above all of a genuine desire to find ways to tackle this sexual saturation but can such activities reach their potential without a national movement for change without someone willing to stand up and spearhead a highprofile campaign maybe monday nights guardian debate a new sexual manifesto will provide some more answers for a unified way forward is legislation the key it has been tried before when the eu proposed banning degrading images of women in the media or do we need a more longterm agenda in our schools in the media in our newsagents in individual women and men during saturdays seminar afshar warned that evidence of feminisms vibrant and political third wave is now easier to locate in the developing world than it is in the west in libya women tell afshar that western feminism is rubbish its all about taking your knickers down they say if this is really the reputation of our womens rights movement abroad if british women really are entering a dead end of passion and sexual enjoyment that simply conforms to tired and hugely unerotic stereotypes of sex and relationships then it is time we did something concrete about it there is hope for change there was a real energy in the room on saturday busy and bursting with ideas it felt like something was happening and about time too now we need action lets write that manifesto,2006-06,need

smoking behind the bike sheds snogging in the park scrawling graffiti on walls wearing clothes your mother hates reading stuff that you shouldnt looking at pictures that are banned and drinking until you throw up are nothing new kids everywhere use their teenage years to try out the things that to them mean adulthood in homes and schools everywhere adults try variously to forbid them or teach them why it might not be such a good idea to copy their very worst excesses growing up is partly about internalising the boundaries the adult world sets and partly about setting them down somewhere new over the last years the boundaries for young women have shifted from the hedge around the garden to the far horizon when i was at school it was a standard assumption that girls couldnt do maths might faint at the sight of blood and could not run anything more taxing than a vicarage tea party change was not imposed on them by adults they fought for it they wrestled with tough angry privileged men who hung on and defended their right to rule women who fought were ridiculed and abused and the most powerful tool in that armoury then as now was to attack their confidence in their sexual attractiveness then as now when a man feels threatened by a woman he denounces her as ugly unsexy someone he wouldnt want to sleep with it is a great strategy to feel undesired and undesirable is not something the average young woman finds easy to deal with whatever else might be won the right to equal pay equal opportunity to join clubs and take our place in ruling the world few heterosexual women then or now were willing to risk the loss of male desire it is that fear more than anything else that sets women against each other those who denounced feminism or started every possibly threatening sentence with the words i am not a feminist but were doing it not because they thought women shouldnt have these things but because they feared male rejection if they identified with the cause young women today have aspirations for themselves that are beyond the wildest dreams of their feminist mothers and grandmothers but that fear of male sexual rejection has not gone away indeed as women have gained power the fear of male rejection seems to have reached epic proportions and always quick to spot a trend the media has picked up on this anxiety and mercilessly exploited it yearolds learn about relationships from sex and the city and desperate housewives and then wear clothes on the street that would once have had them arrested students send pictures of their breasts to nuts magazine just for the buzz of it women who would once have allowed their postnatal tummies to sag gently are desperately starving themselves back into their jeans so that they can be yummy mummies like the celebrities they see in hello magazine those same mothers buy their prepubescent children thongs and dresses with playboy symbols some people suggest that this obsession with the self is actually about a new and more liberated sexuality that all this display is evidence that women are coming out of their closeted world and learning to enjoy their bodies the evidence suggests that this is not the case certainly young women are learning that sexual display attracts male attention the last figures from the national sex and lifestyle survey natsal show that the average age of first intercourse dropped a year in a decade but every study also shows that earlier isnt better there is a very high level of regret among those who have sex under the age of and women are twice as likely as men to regret their first experience and three times as likely to report being the less willing partner this sense of being continually on display up there on the shelves plastered over the billboards smeared over the morning newspaper is not liberation it is sending out a message to young women that in order to be loved it is necessary to be perfect and always available there is nothing in these vapid airbrushed pictures that says anything at all about female desire they are all about male desire these are women who are there to satisfy men not themselves the saddest thing of all is the realisation as ariel levy points out in g today that it is often women not men who have put those pictures there the women who do it are quite literally cashing in on the exploitation and unhappiness of millions of teenage girls who grow up thinking that this is what it means to be a woman and to be desired by men display may be a part of sex for some women it certainly isnt all there is for all women our teens are now the most sexually experienced in europe they are probably also the most confused where other countries treat sex and relationships as a part of education and talk about such things the whole way through school our schools are held in check by a fringe group of religious nutters with a direct line to almost every national newspaper editor the very same newspapers that follow the antics of big brother and pick apart the appearance of every female who sticks her nose above the parapet also denounce any attempt to make sex and relationship education a serious part of the curriculum with headlines such as sex lessons for fiveyearolds while young people are denied the opportunity to discuss their feelings and desires with properly trained responsible adults they are exposed on a daily basis to tv programmes that tell them it is normal to ask for breast implants for their th birthday or to get an extreme makeover if they want to be loved young people will learn how to be adults whichever way they can if we leave the job to the media companies then we shouldnt be shocked that quite a lot of them learn that it is just normally naughty for girls of to get drunk and have sex they may not remember much about it and they almost certainly didnt enjoy it but that is after all what adults do innit our generation may have taught our daughters to be clever and brave but we dont seem to have taught them how to be happy they will have to move that boundary for themselves fortunately moving boundaries is what young people are good at angela phillips will be giving a paper on this subject on thursday at the goldsmiths college seminar the word girl in a global frame ariel levy will be speaking at a guardian debate on raunch culture at pm

fatherhood at a turning point fifty years ago the stereotypical father was a distant disciplinarian figure whose value lay squarely in the size of his pay packet but today fathers day a new survey reveals that stcentury dad wants a closer relationship with his children and is willing to reorder his priorities to achieve it as soon as my first child was born i moved jobs to one that offered flexitime rather than a high salary or great promotion prospects said stephen derrick a community developer worker in leeds my father walked away from his role as a caring father and im having to create that role for myself from scratch he added its harder than i thought but im determined to give my children a different experience of fatherhood to my one a study of new fathers and new mothers by the equal opportunities commission found eight out of new fathers would take three months paternity leave if it was available despite the enormous shifts in attitude however dads and the babies a household analysis found new fathers admitted that a range of barriers prevented them reconciling their aspirations with the reality of their lives the dilemma of the modern father is how to square up the pressure of work and the quality of the time they spend with their children said derrick who is a member of barnardos babyfather a profathering initiative even with the career sacrifices ive made im still wrestling to achieve that balance modern families come in many different shapes there are million fathers living with dependent children in britain including lone parents compared with in there are more than two million nonresident fathers whatever the situation of stcentury dad however the overwhelming message is that todays fathers are more closely involved in their childrens lives than ever before with per cent saying they felt as confident when caring for their baby as their partner dads are becoming more involved in their childrens lives from the very start with more men taking on a caring role per cent of fathers take time off around the birth of their first child usually to attend antenatal classes scans and other hospital appointments said jenny watson chair of the equal opportunities commission who commissioned the nop survey the pace of the change has been rapid between and the proportion of dads taking more than two weeks leave around the time of their babys birth rose from per cent to per cent the average time spent by fathers with their young children has increased eightfold since the seventies gone also is the assumption that men should bring home the bacon while women cook it per cent of fathers with babies questioned said they did not see earning as their main role my role is very much the same as my wifes its sharing the childcare and ensuring our son is bought up in a safe and loving environment said jon bernstein a multimedia editor for a large city firm in london past a certain level money is irrelevant to achieving that aim bernstein took leave around the birth of his son sam in and moved jobs shortly afterwards to enable him to work parttime he and his wife are expecting their second child shortly thanks to the dramatic rise in womens employment in only per cent of households with dependent children were dualearner compared with per cent in women are more reliant on their partners ability to share childcare than on his earning capacity in response to this changing need seven in fathers in had made some adjustment to their working pattern in response to their new role as a parent and three in worked flexitime to help balance work and family nearly three times the proportion of but many men still find themselves unable to realise their ambitions to be a stcentury dad with seven out of saying they were not as involved in childcare as they would like a third of dads questioned admitted to working more than hours a week while one in five said financial pressure or workplace obstacles stopped them reducing their work as much they would like im at my desk at am every day so i can leave at pm said bernstein but there is still both an implicit pressure from those around me and a selfimposed pressure from myself that leaves me feeling like im sneaking away early if i succumbed to those pressures i would never see my son at all during the week paternity clauses just as i was about to give birth mick

we are never told her name none of the soldiers would have been interested in such niceties the only considerations were that she was vietnamese and a virgin it was like an animal pack one of the participants recalled we just stood in line and we screwed her suddenly unexpectedly the unnamed woman turned towards him why are you doing this to me she said in english why whether in vietnam iraq or cornwall rape destroys the victims trust in the world the realisation that other individuals are impervious to ones suffering never wanes yet violent sexuality is alarmingly common last year over women in britain reported being raped this statistic ignores the fact that most rapes are never spoken about according to the british crime survey only one in six rapes is reported to the police why is rape so common it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the fusion of aggression and sexuality appeals to some men it is striking how frequently rapists situate their abuses in a framework associated with dating culture bizarrely employing the language of romance in the midst of the assault when confronted with evidence of pain they either eroticise it or demand a simulation of gratification from their victims even more disturbingly rapists frequently insist that they not their victims are traumatised by the assault during the vietnam war for instance the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder was given to servicemen who had suffered the trauma of raping other individuals today the psychological stress of military service is being used to justify the sexual torture that took place in abu ghraib and elsewhere sympathy for the abuser is not restricted to war zones in britain today there is considerable scepticism expressed towards women who accuse men of rape in fact false accusations are less common in rape than in other criminal cases but any woman with a slightly adventurous history or hailing from a powerless group is normally right to think that making a complaint is not worthwhile in the s around one third of reported rape cases ended in convictions this dropped to around one quarter by the s today only of rapes reported to the police end up with a conviction and in gloucestershire suffolk and cambridgeshire only two men are convicted for every women who report being raped are we to believe that women in these counties are particularly prone to lying about rape of course no one is denying that the justice system has improved the times when judges could joke about the colour of a victims knickers are over however the gap between law in books and law in practice is still wide informal norms of case processing judgment and sentencing have remained substantially unchanged legal decisions continue to be profoundly affected by assumptions about what constitutes real rape it is encouraging therefore to hear the sentencing guidelines council insisting last week that date rape and rape within marriage should be treated as severely as rape by a stranger the council is calling for judges to impose tougher prison sentences yet rape myths are still pervasive in particular the belief that victims somehow brought it on themselves an icm poll last year found that one in three people believed that women who acted flirtatiously were partially or totally responsible if they ended up being raped and one in four believed the same for women who wore sexy clothes both men and women proved willing to blame the victim in other areas debate about rape is silenced some forms of sexual abuse remain so taboo that victims have great difficulty reporting them forced sex within marriage is hardly unusual for instance the rape of men has also remained out of bounds in the rape debates the gay community is reluctant to discuss the extent of the problem perhaps legitimately fearing its link to a homophobic agenda the abuse of men by women is another deadly secret the tired mantra of the s according to which all men are rapists rape fantasists or beneficiaries of a rape culture has become mere wishful thinking in the face of what happened at abu ghraib not confronting these myths is bad for all of us the politics of sexual pleasure has been displaced into the politics of sexual fear such negative politics leaves no room for anything save the paradox of telling women and other potential victims that they need to purchase freedom by investing in deadbolt locks as we reduce tolerance for displays of macho sexual aggression in daily life we need to educate men into positive male erotics finally victims of abuse too often feel that they are to blame for their victimisation if we are to imagine a world without the spectre of sexual violence hanging over us perpetrators have to be held fully accountable for their deeds too many have been getting away with rape we cannot tolerate it any longer joanna bourke is professor of history at birkbeck college her book on rapists is published next year

i am a recovering lipstick lesbian thats not to say ive stopped wearing lipstick it simply means ive stopped kissing girls thats right at the peak of the lesbian fad when you cant turn on the telly without finding bad girls or the the l word i have left the ranks of my former sisterhood and betrayed them after years of being in relationships with women why have i returned to as my boyfriend likes to tease the true faith heterosexuality the answer confuses me in fact it confuses most people i hear from the gay gossip mill that many of the lesbian elite including my ex who left me for a yearold have been saying i was never actually gay funny my girlfriends never said that in bed what does that do to my nomination for a lambda literary award and my commentaries on gay marriage for nprs all things considered my mother compares lesbianism with my other phase vegetarianism which lasted over a decade too you know bounced over to heterosexuality to see if women were faring any better than years ago when i got fed up with the straight scene and men in general perhaps i should have just given up on the man who broke my heart but instead i tossed out the whole gender and developed an appreciation for girls all i know is that as a former vegetarian i discovered my body craves steak as a former lesbian i have discovered similar cravings at the same time im really glad i didnt spend the last years living a traditional life i had a terrible track record with men when i finally decided to give them up for lent becoming a lesbian was a logical decision men are only per cent of the population so why limit myself i left the straight world behind and discovered that i could have much healthier relationships with women the sex was good too of course as i found out theres not a whole lot of difference between men and women in the heartbreaking department the confusion comes from people wondering how i can go from sex with men to sex with women without pause or ponder its not difficult i know the mystery is what girls do in bed lets just say we do everything everyone else does we just do it longer women are always ready to pop if you know what buttons to press maybe i got fed up with men because none knew how to press the right buttons granted i didnt know much about my buttons before i became a lesbian but thats whats great about being gay women know about women and everything your mother wouldnt tell you your girlfriend will so why would i leave the isle of lesbos for the promised land of pecs i mean women are soft and cuddly they understand all about pmt men are hard they cringe when you get that glazed pmt gaze and make plans to go on holiday with the lads they dont say things like did you take your primrose oil kissing a man who hasnt shaved is like kissing a brillo pad most do not realise that women dont need an intermission we are the second and third act the standing ovation and the curtain call trembling in the wings afterward however there are things about men that a lesbian like me is learning to appreciate for instance im the only one in the house with pmt thank god and im the only one in bed having layer upon layer of pleasure women are exhausting its also a relief to be sassy and not hurt his feelings he likes my acerbic wit while i always seemed to be ruffling my exs feathers he also cooks the man who seduced me or who i seduced were still debating this issue is british that made a difference he can quote shakespeare and monty python and has that sexy accent too british men seem to be more sensitive than american men they can discuss things other than football except during the world cup the champions league the fa cup and when i was going through a rough patch he helped me through it as a writer too he offered me a refuge through weekly emails discussing everything from the lambing season to his broken heart it had been a lifelong dream of mine to attend the hayonwye literary festival and in the midst of my divorce no we werent really married because in the land of the free gays still cant marry the man i would eventually seduce invited me to hay for tea it was not a comeon how could it be i was gay or was i tea in wales sounded like an excellent idea though i admit i was more interested in a properly poured guinness anyway i put in a travel requisition to the college where i teach creative writing and the next thing i knew i was being sent to hayonwye for professional development you can pick up girls and i can pick up girls james suggested in his email personally i couldnt wait to be developed professionally an unshaven james dressed as casually as any american picked me up in abergavenny and an hour later we were sitting outside his cottage having a glass of wine and talking about our divorces just like we had been talking about them through emails for the past few months the demise of our year relationships and former lives hung heavy in the warm spring air but the anticipation of new possibilities lingered on the breeze the next day the festival began and i found myself swept up in hay fever i felt like i had been living outside my body for months but surrounded by book lovers authors and pimms i felt fully present and accounted for i hadnt laughed in months and now i couldnt stop i met wonderful people in the pubs and queues i felt intoxicated by the mere presence of my host after my ex left me i thought i should try men again and james was the perfect guinea pig he knew my story so if it was a miserable experience he wouldnt take it personally and we could laugh it off and still be friends still i hadnt made up my mind so i maintained professional distance i mean i couldnt very well stand in the green room talking with stephen fry about gay marriage and think about shagging james could i but i was what the hell was going on i hadnt been attracted to men for years ok ive always had a thing for biceps but women can have good biceps too well almost as good that first weekend was a whirr we partied asked impertinent questions of other writers and had a grand time finally we ended up at the guardian party chatting with editors and drinking cheap champagne there was an afterhours party at whitney court but james couldnt find any girls to pick up and neither could i it was late or early depending on how you turn the world the sky shifted from black to indigo as we sped through the lanes back to his cottage madeleine peyroux sang dance me to the end of love in the living room we kissed like friends who want to be naughty birds started to chirp youre not going to get weird on me are you he asked i wasnt planning on it are you i quipped we write good dialogue for the next week the precoital line seemed to be not those damn birds again i dont think either of us had stayed up so late for so many consecutive nights in years we danced to elvis costello jools holland neither james nor i had danced in years that was when things started to shift instead of wondering what i was doing with a man i started wondering why i had spent years with someone who didnt like to dance party socialise the list went on after i returned home our relationship seemed to take a more literary bent pun intended we began to correspond as the fictitious characters out of an ian fleming novel no james is not really his name but it seemed an appropriate response when he said youre quite a girl pussy with the same long accent on the u that sean connery made so famous we have quite a lot in common too i know what he likes in women lots of them hes been very honest about his penchant for the ladies which is why he was an especially good candidate for my experiment dont be surprised if you call some day and a woman answers the phone he warned me dont be surprised if you call me and a woman answers the phone too i had thought that hayonwye would be like las vegas what you do there stays there it was safe and far away from my real life i didnt want a relationship or anything else complicated and i certainly didnt want to have to go home and inform the lesbian community that i was no longer a member of americas disenfranchised class the thing is i went back to hay twice more last year and at quiz night in hay this past december we won golden tickets to this years festival england has gotten under my skin and despite pussy galores imperviousness this james has gotten under my skin as well he has a prose style to make any literary lesbian swoon is it others who feel the need to define me or me who feels the need to define myself my real friends gay and straight alike are happy im happy they dont care what or whom i do as long as im enjoying my life theyre just glad im not calling up sobbing any more did i realise that women can break my heart just as easily as men and decide to widen the playing field to include everyone or is it more important who a person is on the inside than their gender maybe it was all those bloody bookshops in hay that made me swoon but i think it was more than that because im still swooning maybe i really like men maybe i just like james gay or straight or bi does it really matter ok hes told me id better not leave him for a woman which from a womaniser is pretty funny the next time we walked the hallowed streets of hayonwye i was silently commemorating one year of not getting weird on each other poosy youre quite a girl he teased me the morning after a book party oh james i sighed from across the pillows and tangled sheets he looked at me and asked so why were you gay i sipped my tea and pondered my lifes choices it seemed a good idea at the time heather dune macadam the author of two books is working on her third dear james love pussy james aka simon

prime minister said today more details confusion over rape sentences date rape bad as attack by stranger judges told says the guardian but the timess splash reports that a rapist may receive a shorter sentence if his victim withdrew his or her consent at the last minute confused no doubt a wouldbe rapist will be too the times unusually heavyhanded headline adds to the fog surrounding the proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sentences for rapes after intimacy cut says the paper six years ago the home office rejected the idea of a lesser offence of date rape ruth hall of women against rape said the concept was now being resurrected by the back door the mail highlights the proposal that men who rape their wives should face the same punishment as gang rapists according to the guidelines the seriousness of rape or word omitted assault is always aggravated when the offender is in a position of trust in relation to the victim hence one imagines the confusion over date rape a victim is not really in a position to trust a man he or she has just met gang rapists and those who have breached trust will normally be sentenced to eight years in jail the starting point sentence will be five says the mail reading todays coverage however a wouldbe attacker might reasonably think that if his victim starts engaging in consensual word omitted activity with him then he or she

the courts should be just as tough on date rape and rape within marriage as sexual attacks by strangers according to official sentencing guidelines proposed yesterday the guidelines say that the minimum starting point for judges considering sentences in rape cases should be five years imprisonment in cases where the victim is over much tougher sentences are recommended in rape cases involving children under and elderly victims a spokesman for the sentencing guidelines council chaired by lord phillips the lord chief justice said the new guidelines will not lead to a reduction in the average sentence of years for rape currently of those convicted of rape receive a prison sentence with jailed for five years or more the guidelines set out detailed sentencing instructions for the courts in types of sex crimes including new offences such as exposure which is likely to attract a week sentence for a repeat offender and voyeurism likely to lead to a month sentence if images are posted on a website the guidelines also stress the need for the court to consider the new public protection sentences under which offenders are sent down for an indefinite period and not released if they present a significant risk of harm to the community the guidelines also remind the courts to consider a sexual offences prevention order if there is any danger of reoffending and an order banning offenders from working with children the councils decision to reject calls for the different treatment of date rape endorses existing case law which says acquaintance rape should be treated no less seriously than attacks by strangers the calls for a lesser sentence were based on hopes it would boost the very low conviction rate in such cases but the council does suggest that where the victim engaged in consensual sexual activity with the offender immediately before the offence it should be considered as a mitigating factor which could lead to a small discount on the sentence a council spokesman said the decision to set the fiveyear minimum starting point for rape took account of the reduction in sentences recommended in the criminal justice act and there would be no reduction in the average sentence for rape as a result the guidelines recommend that where there are no aggravating or mitigating factors the starting point for sentences should be five years if the victim is over eight years if the victim is aged to and years if the victim is under sir igor judge the council deputy chairman said the guidelines emphasised the seriousness with which sexual offences should be treated by judges sentencers are particularly aware of the psychological as well as the physical impact of these offences on victims the director of public prosecutions ken mcdonald who is also on the council

date rape and rape within marriage are as serious as attacks carried out by strangers and judges should continue to punish them accordingly the sentencing guidelines council said today the council has proposed new guidelines that set out detailed instructions for judges on how to sentence more than different types of sex crime the guidelines are designed to reflect the harm caused to victims by sex offenders in the proposal the council backed existing case law that said judges should treat acquaintance rape and relationship rape no less seriously than attacks by strangers it also recommended a minimum of five years imprisonment for rapists whose victim was aged over a council spokeswoman said none of the recommendations in the guidelines should lead to reductions in average sentences the sex crimes detailed in the proposals would not be eligible for the reduction available for other types of offences she said the proposed guidelines which are out for consultation until the end of july suggested a victims age should be taken into account when deciding the level of punishment with extreme youth or age being an aggravating factor they also recommended higher minimum sentences in cases involving victims aged under or victims with any form of mental disorder other proposals included a month custodial sentence in cases where sexual activity was recorded and put on the internet and six years for the production of indecent photographs of children the councils deputy chairman sir igor judge said these guidelines emphasise the seriousness with which sexual offences should be treated by sentencing judges sentencers are particularly aware of the psychological as well as the physical impact of these offences on victims although the purpose of these guidelines is to achieve a consistent level of sentencing for the same type of offence they cannot deal with the specific impact of each individual offence which has to be taken into account by the sentencing judge the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who is also a member of the council said the guidelines would help judges choose appropriate sentences for the new offences created by the criminal justice act in addition the dangerous offender provisions in the act apply to most of these offences so any offender who is found to present a significant risk of serious harm to other people will receive lengthy sentences under those provisions designed to protect the public under the proposed guidelines the starting point for imprisonment for a single case of rape would be five years if the victim was aged over eight years if the victim was over but under and years if the victim was under aggravating factors such as abduction gang rape or sustained attacks would raise the sentence starting points to eight years years and years for the respective age brackets currently of those convicted of rape are sentenced to jail the current average length of sentence for rape is seven and a half years the page document also suggested flashers should be given a community sentence or fine for a first offence and people caught having sex in a public lavatory should not be jailed a home office spokeswoman said sexual offences were terrible crimes that can destroy lives the government believes offenders convicted of serious sexual and violent offences should receive lengthy prison sentences indeed those convicted of rape can receive a life sentence she added the government is committed to rebalancing the whole criminal justice system in favour of victims sentences which reflect the seriousness of crimes committed by offenders play a key role in this work the average sentence for rape is currently over seven years and we see no reason why this should change,2006-06,date rape rape within

women may be securing a greater number of executive jobs but they are also suffering increasingly acute pay discrimination as they climb the career ladder according to new research government figures reveal that women are failing to reap the benefits enjoyed by men at the top of their professions the uks top male earners rake in a massive per cent more on average than the highestearning women women in fulltime work typically take home per cent less than their male counterparts but these figures show for the first time how much the gap increases as women move into more senior roles campaigners say this is stark evidence that the glass ceiling remains as real as ever others say there is a psychological barrier as women tend to underestimate their abilities and worth while men typically talk up their strengths and ignore their own weaknesses men are also research says much more likely to ask for a pay rise than women the figures compiled by the equal opportunities commission from the governments annual survey of hours and earnings show that men in the uk now need to earn just over a year to break into the top per cent women need a salary of to take them into the highest bracket per cent less than their male colleagues at the bottom of the pay scale the gap narrows to per cent jenny watson chair of the commission said that being a woman in the uk workforce comes at a cost whether for office cleaners or company directors there is a significant gap between the top mens earnings and the top womens she said our statistics show that women make up just per cent of directors at ftse companies per cent of the senior judiciary and per cent of senior police officers so its no surprise that the pay gap is widest for the highest earners researchers have grouped pay rates into bands and compared the most recent figures with based on the average fulltime hour week men needed to earn in to take them into the premier pay league in the figure was the equivalent figures for women are and the bottom per cent of men earn on average while the lowest female earners take home kate bellamy senior policy officer at the fawcett society which campaigns for equality between men and women in the workforce said it is appalling that years after equal pay laws came in women are still being shortchanged in the workplace her organisation has called on the government to introduce mandatory pay audits for all employers this is the only way we will be able to end the pay secrecy that allows discrimination to thrive especially in the private sector where pay gaps are widest she added the latest study comes just months after tony blairs women and work commission report which showed that since the sex discrimination act came into force in the gaps between the pay of men and women had narrowed only marginally for those in fulltime work it is per cent while the gap between male and female parttimers is per cent the authors of this study aim to reframe the debate about the gap and say direct discrimination is only one part of the equation the major cause of unequal pay according to the report is an employment structure designed for and by men campaigners have pointed to other factors such as the fact that women tend to have more responsibilities at home and are less inclined to commit to a longhours culture of presenteeism they highlight a psychological barrier one study showed that when a firm advertised a senior management role at a year they did not get one female applicant when they readvertised it at they were inundated by women psychologists say women in general are offered lower starting salaries are less likely to negotiate than men and once in a job are not as adept at asking for rises women tend to talk about their weaknesses and worry about being overpromoted while men trumpet their abilities the cost of inequality the macdonald hotels chain struck an thhour deal last month with elizabeth irons its

there was a sliver of good news for women in business last week the number of female directors is slowly rising according to the research company experian women now make up of all uk directors which represents a small increase on last year however most of these women are working in companies employing no more than people with of female directors involved in firms with a turnover of less than m each year and men still dominate the boardrooms of larger companies only women are directors of companies employing more than people compared to men small but perfectly formed so why are women more likely to end up running smaller firms according to jane bruton editor of grazia magazine many have had enough of working in large firms and have set up their own businesses to avoid the frustrations of corporate life of the women who entered the grazia o x awards for women in business around of them had left senior positions within business to go it alone she says while for many women the driving force was a true entrepreneurial desire to create run and manage a business which they passionately believed in some also felt driven out by the lack of support and opportunity within big business for women with children and felt that they would either have to comprise career or kids to succeed glenda stone chief executive of aurora a womens networking organisation agrees women choose to run small businesses because they want to balance working with other commitments and working in a larger company doesnt allow them to do that she says many women who are involved in companies at boardroom level also get frustrated with the politics played by senior executives clare simpson now runs her own human resources consultancy business employment matters she used to be the hr director of a travel company with a seat on the board one of the reasons i left was because i felt i was spending more time involved in company politics than actually doing the job she says being on the board felt like being back in the playground fighting over who gets the sweets the flexibility of having her own business also appealed to simpson who says she was born to be a consultant she says i felt i could manage my own time more effectively and would be able to say yes or no to clients in a more considered manner adding that she finds running her own business much more rewarding too although the number of women running their own businesses is increasing auroras glenda stone says more could be done to boost numbers even further she suggests more financial education is key and adds getting access to money is not the problem the uk is awash with cash culture shocks britains leading employers organisation the cbi is encouraged by the increasing number of women becoming directors and particularly by the large number of younger women deciding to run their own business experians survey found that the proportion of female directors in the age range was higher at than in any other age group the survey also found that female directors are much more common in some industries than in others women are far more likely to be involved in education health social work or hospitality than in heavy industry or finance in britains utility companies for example there are male directors for every female director hanna haas policy adviser at the cbi says to get more women into these more maledominated businesses there needs to be better career advice for women in school and better work placements robin jones founded the catering company charlton house years ago the company employs people and expects to produce a turnover of m this year her boardroom is made up of three women and two men being involved at boardroom level has underlined the importance of making sure staff at all levels get their voices heard and their opinions noted especially in an industry where there is a high percentage of women working parttime she says she has no time for an office culture where people feel they have to be at their desks for long hours to prove they are doing their job well im always telling them to go home she says id happily kick them out of the building and lock the door so they couldnt sit there anymore jones is one of many women who agree there needs to be a radical change in the boardroom culture at large companies if they want to attract more female executives according to clare simpson boardrooms need to become more about meritocracy and getting a job done rather than about politics simpson also thinks it is important to encourage better representation of women on the boards of large companies it would be wrong just to accept that women are never going to be on the boards of big companies she says a company that lacks diversity of any kind loses the balance

the inevitable day has arrived the child support agency has finally shut its ineffectual doors complete with its backlog of claims what a great day for desperate mums and kids across the country not only has the whole outfit failed abysmally its left literally hundreds of thousands of single parents out of pocket and this is all from the government who wanted to eradicate child poverty but wait new labour has come up with its biggest pearl of wisdom since getting into office instead of forcing absent dads to pay they want to give couples more freedom to make their own deals has anyone in the department of works and pensions actually been involved in a relationship breakup in the majority of cases the whole reason why you have separated in the first place is because things have gone so hideously wrong you cant even bear to breathe the same air anymore dealing with issues as sensitive as money is a minefield when my daughters dad left one promise he kept was to pay up maintenance four years on he still does deposit his few hundred quid into my account each month but it doesnt even cover the childcare bills very fortunately for me and much to my ex dreads chagrin his parents help out financially too that makes an enormous difference but dreads himself claims he cannot afford more each school holiday i am forced to beg cajole remind by rapid text fire to persuade him to pay for the extra childcare for school holidays when my daughter started school she had to spend longer hours with the childminder and so the bill shot up but he refused to pay more if i complain he has a simple solution move out of london cheaper rent give up work no child minding costs go on the dole and get council property genius so i have no choice but to let him pay whatever he wants to and whenever he wants to and if i really beg because for example the six weeks holiday is coming up he might throw me a bit extra but despite this arrangement i consider myself to be one of the very fortunate ones what will happen to the mothers whose exes simply tell them to naff off according to the work and pensions secretary john hutton hes preparing a ton of bricks to drop on their heads perhaps those bricks would be better employed for building affordable housing for britains millions of single mums that would be more use hutton assures us hell seize nonpaying dads passports to stop them going on expensive foreign holidays and bring in electronic tagging to stop delinquent dads go to the pub but how on earth is this going to help the very people its designed for the children hitting dads social life isnt going to pay for food rent and childcare in modern britain we are taxed for everything from the first packet of fags you buy to the day you shuffle off the mortal coil so why isnt the government prepared to tax for arguable the most precious and vulnerable in our society why isnt there a child tax why isnt every single man as soon as he has fathered a child mistakenly or otherwise taxed at source even if he is with the mother still why cant the money go straight to the childminder or vouchers for clothes or even food and of course if the mother buggers off shell have to fork out too this is about money to feed children not ticking daddy off by stopping him catching a flight to bermuda and perhaps it would give the spotty herberts who have seven kids by seven different women food for thought or suddenly cash for condoms paying from day one for every child you have sends out a louder and more powerful message compared to any safe sex campaign when my ex dreads drops our daughter off after his access visit to dash off home in his fathers car hes borrowing it to live in his girlfriends house she pays the mortgage and tells me he cant see his daughter the following week because hes off on holiday i think he totalled four last year of course it sticks in my craw but i have no idea how i would go about asking him to cough up more probably the only way is in court and that would almost definitely shatter any fragile semblance of friendship or civility between us yet if he was forced to own up to exactly what he earns and spends then perhaps a

there is nothing normal about sitting down to breakfast with seven men all in various states of undress there is also nothing normal or healing about tripping over the legs of men masturbating in the day room and there is nothing normal about sleeping next to a man you havent met before so says jolie goodman a campaigner for women only wards she believes that this type of thing is an everyday experience for many women in mental health settings where there is a continued tolerance of inappropriate sexual behaviour ranging from touching to rape despite real improvements in some places why is this still the case why does the physical and emotional safety of women in mental distress continue to be a low priority why are male staff members carrying out close observation of women in bathrooms and toilets in bedrooms during the night or even holding women down for forcible injections despite guidance to the contrary earlier this month government watchdog the national patient safety agency published a report revealing reported sexual incidents including reported rapes in mental health care settings between november and september this is almost one reported rape a month in of the reported rapes the alleged perpetrator was a member of staff the nhs litigation authority has also received three claims for compensation following unwanted pregnancies the report which the department of health initially tried to suppress also states that the problem is being significantly under reported to make matters worse over half the women who come in to patient wards have had previous experiences of violence rape domestic violence or child sexual abuse often women find their history ignored many practitioners lack the confidence and skills to recognise and talk about experiences of violence and abuse better training and support to enable staff to talk about past and present abuse is crucial unless we build a culture which allows abuse to be talked about abuses of power within mental health services will continue in chantells experience as a psychiatric patient it is hard to get people to believe what you tell them when she was she was admitted voluntarily to a psychiatric ward one night she woke to find one of the male nurses touching her and trying to get under the bedding and she started to scream she told her mother the next day but the nurse denied it and no action was taken she was told it was a symptom of her illness zara was in the grounds of a south london hospital when she was raped by a fellow patient she had complained on several occasions to staff about this patient following her around and making her feel uncomfortable the police were called but no further action was taken except that she was moved to another ward as the police felt her evidence would not stand up in court the npsa report found that the response of mental health trusts to serious incidents varied and it was not clear how many incidents were reported to the police in the mental health act commission found sexual harassment of women patients on over half the mixed wards surveyed while only of the wards had written policies on sexual harassment and abuse in the department of health pledged to abolish mixed sex wards and bring in separate sleeping bathroom and day facilities guidance to raise the profile of gender sensitive services more broadly was published but only one target was set on womens sleeping areas no extra funding was made available in the government reported that of health authorities were complying with the guidance on women only wards yet this is far from the experience of many mental health service users implementation has been patchy and the mental health charity mind has called for a national audit while in some areas real change and improvement have taken place in others the change has been largely semantic many health trusts have simply put a curtain between the male and female sleeping bays and claimed to comply with the guidance a mind survey in found that of women had been admitted to mixed sex accommodation did not feel it was helpful to their recovery and research by the brent user group in found womenonly spaces were often not respected by male staff visitors and patients this week is also the first anniversary of the report by the kerrhaslam inquiry over women reported abuse and rape over a year period by two nhs psychiatrists william kerr and michael haslam the inquiry report talked about a moral failing at the heart of the nhs the women reported the rapes to gps and other health professionals but with a few exceptions no action was taken nigel pleming who conducted the inquiry concluded that abuse would continue without action by the government professional bodies and others his recommendations included independent advocacy systematic data gathering and robust and mandatory training for mental health professions a year on we are still waiting for the government to say how it intends to respond to the report the inquiry only took place because women like kathy haq who was abused by william kerr when she was campaigned years later for it to take place they did not want other ladies to go through what we went through getting together and being listened to and believed was part of their healing process jonathan coe of witness a charity representing people who have been abused by health and social care professionals says our guess is that the npsa report greatly understates the true picture the government needs to do much more to ensure that allegations of sexualised behaviour by health and social care staff are recorded there needs to be a requirement in all health and social care training to discuss professional boundaries professional abuse and responsibilities to report if a practitioner thinks something is going on it is now time for meaningful targets to be set that include the voices of women service users and for funding to be made available to develop real alternatives we have talked enough now we have to act jeanette copperman jcoppermancityacuk is a senior lecturer in social work at city university not their real

ten years ago next week a single called wannabe crashlanded at the top of the british charts it was a pearling record full of brio swagger and the addictive little elements that kicked off with its first line ill tell you what i want what i really really want and peaked with the mysterious claim that what its authors were after was a zigazigah within six months the inescapable spice girls were the subject of features in titles as diverse as nme and the spectator where they expounded the new theory of girl power summed up thus its about equality and fun and trying to rule your life when more academic voices weighed in however the girls were found wanting in the view of the american feminist jennifer pozner it was probably a fair assumption to say that a zigazigah is not spice shorthand for subvert the dominant paradigm here it was alleged was postfeminism revealed as a busted flush five supposedly empowered starlets whose diminutive nicknames and pushup bras suggested patriarchal business as usual extending the logic of that argument you might even charge them with responsibility for the wave of raunch culture recently summed up in these pages as womens collusion in their own objectification you could but youd be wrong the spice girls were shot through with absurdity and contradiction but in context their claim to be waging war on a testosteroneheavy consensus just about held up lest we forget found popcultural machismo at something of a peak the gallagher brothers expressing the opinion that birds are rubbish the euro tournament cementing a specious relationship between football and music and then came wannabe prompting the kind of talk that heralded their first appearance in the trade journal music week just when boys with guitars threatened to rule pop life an allgirl inyerface pop group have arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble compare them to the pop people who followed in their wake and the sense of some almost accidental burst of joyous nonconformity gets even greater if the nonguitar end of the pop market now seems to be dominated by vacuous drones the spices not least when they fired their manager simon fuller in an act of quite splendid selfsabotage looked like something close to anarchists back on the terrain of sexual politics consider the absence of such contemporary promotional tics as regularly disrobing in your videos and turning in the obligatory fauxlesbian poses for the lads magazines in a modern context they look almost chaste so how did the postspice world go so awry a small part of the answer is bound up with their own greed more importantly girl power proved to be as nothing compared to altogether stronger cultural currents embodied by the contents of our newsstands and highstreet shops still for those who heard the opening bars of that song and sensed a new world there may be a faint glimmer of hope writing this i came across a copy of germaine greers the whole woman published in when spice hegemony was fading fast the spice girls did make a difference she wrote because their most passionate fans were eightyearold girls a study of childrens oral culture had found in the postspice climate that whereas half the space in school playgrounds used to be taken up by a selfselecting group of boys playing football girls clapping and dancing games were taking over if those fans were eight then theyll be coming up to now the great minds behind zoo nuts and love island might want to take note maybe just maybe something slightly more interesting might be around the corner

a single mother living in south london with her yearold son is advertising for household help on the web what she says she wants is a livein cleaner read on though and the job seems to require rather more than that the applicant must be kind reliable honest good speak fluent english and if you can be away for weekends or out for all of it this would be preferable when the applicant is in her duties include taking the child to school every day shopping going to the dry cleaners making the beds and changing them cleaning the whole house thoroughly twice a week doing all the laundry and ironing collecting the boy taking care of him after school cooking and giving him supper and babysitting in place of a mother who is out for three evenings a week this is not a cleaner this is a substitute parent what this mother is asking for is someone who will give her household and her child the care and attention she isnt around to provide but while she emphasises the need for kindness she seems to imagine she can expect an emotional engagement which she doesnt intend to reciprocate and which can be turned off at the end of every shift not only must the cleaner make him or herself scarce at weekends but she warns we value our privacy and want someone very independent as you will not be included in family activity i recognise what this mother is asking for i had livein nannies for almost years and this advertisement expresses baldly and painfully the impossible triple role most parents would secretly like their carers to provide they would like them to be expert and competent housewives loving and capable mother figures and to dematerialise like a ghost expressing no emotional needs the minute the parent returns to the house not many parents are as honest with themselves and their audience as this woman is but not many would be expecting this paragon of emotional selfsufficiency and generosity to materialise for the wages on offer here the salary is a week what this reflects is that the market for domestic help is changing fast five or years ago employing a livein nanny or carer was the preserve of the very well paid i once calculated that after paying for my nannys wage tax insurance car and living expenses i was left with less than a month had i been a single parent i could never have afforded one thats no longer so this week according to research by recruitment website gumtree the amount spent on the domestic market has tripled in the last decade now adding up to bn a year today one in three britons pays someone else to do work around the home whether gardening cleaning housekeeping or childcare and of those one in four say they could not manage without the paid help they get half of all parents are employers of some kind the leap in spending is partly a reflection of the largescale movement of women into the workplace of family breakdown and of the longer hours that many people are working but it is also a reflection of greater economic inequality the gap between rich and poor has widened even in the past decade the superrich the top and have pulled away from the rest of us but perhaps more important for the higher and middleincome working adults who are looking for ways to make their lives easier the bottom of society has got poorer in addition there are now large numbers of eastern european migrants and illegal immigrants who are willing to work for lower wages than britons would expect domestic help has become a possibility for whole swaths of people who would not have been able to afford it before while richer people can afford more of it employers at both ends of the scale are responding with alacrity whats remarkable is the range of jobs being offered nearly years ago when jonathan gathornehardy wrote his book the rise and fall of the english nanny he listed almost nostalgically the or so grades of job that could be expected in a victorian or edwardian household gathornehardy was convinced he had witnessed the end of the servant era what he had no way of knowing was that he was indeed writing just at a pivotal moment in english social history but it was not the one he thought it was his book was published in close to the highwater mark for british economic equality from the s to the s the wage gap narrowed steadily fuelled by a postwar ethic of greater fairness and by the power of the trade unions bluecollar workers were able to keep families comfortably off on a single wage but the unions were about to lose their power wives were about to be forced out to work to keep families going from the end of the decade the income gap would start to widen again at the same time the ideas of feminism were encouraging richer women to enter the workforce in pursuit of independence and equality their demand for domestic support and the supply of it was about to be reborn now its possible again to find private households advertising for weekend and holiday nannies assistant housekeepers cooks resident cleaners second au pairs maternity nurses gardeners handymen drivers and dogwalkers staff are being asked to sew greet and look after guests serve at formal tables assist with children on nannies days off deal with tradesmen and manage household accounts split shifts are not uncommon with staff expected to start early in the morning have three or four hours off in the middle of the day and work again until late fiveandahalf and sixday weeks are common too a single bachelor in central london needs a cookcleanerhousekeeper daily except sunday a chelsea household offers its assistant housekeeper mondays off and a halfday thursdays not negotiable it sounds just like the terms on offer to mary poppins but with none of the charm of fiction what runs through many of these advertisements whether at the top or bottom of the price range is a tone of slightly impatient precision employers accustomed to the role of consumer in the rest of their lives are setting out their desired combination of skills and qualities and waiting for it to arrive like a salad or a new desk most ads specify that there is no point in replying unless every requirement is met but it is noticeable that these lists of strict requirements contain a greater longing families want someone who will not only offer care but also warmth they hope that these jobs will be done with enthusiasm as if they were being done out of love rather than for money ads ask hopefully for people to be cheerful happy positive a onechild family in bedfordshire says of their housekeeper must be a good cook and always willing to please a family of five seeking a housekeeper for a sevenday week in london says they must be mature responsible and fanatical about cleanliness and hygiene a family looking for a home help in chiswick says they must love children even though the job doesnt include childcare and is only for nine hours a week and the worstpaid jobs are no different a single mother expecting a nanny to work a shocking hours a week for is nevertheless expecting happiness and friendliness at the price sometimes the wording indicates the inevitable disappointments in the past a london family offering a fantastic parttime housekeepers job to a loyal person say they need someone who will benefit from our caring and generous nature and not dilute it by not being forwardthinking and practically minded another single mother in the city adds i do not want to be a tyrant boss so it is important that you enjoy what you do and are happy to take responsibility for what needs to be done yet another lone mother offers a bonus if an au pair stays at least a year and gives three weeks notice before she leaves as otherwise it is just too disruptive for my child in part these exacting desires are just a recognition of the genuine difficulties of having strangers working within the home in our individualised culture homes have become the ultimate private space and our retreat from an often hostile universe in much of our lives we have been allowed to avoid any unsought intimacy when people come into our houses to work it may be necessary but it is also an intrusion they may bring alien values or patterns of behaviour one man describes sacking his housekeeper whom he scarcely ever saw because he could not bear the lingering smell of her perfume in the flat twice a week a single woman an academic talks of her mixed resentment and subsequent guilt at feeling forced to spend half an hour twice a week having coffee with her cleaner it is a pattern established years ago out of guilt at the unequal employeremployee relationship which she has never been able to break but she doesnt want this much human contact as she wryly says its more time than she has to spend with her best friend she wishes she could have the cleaners goodwill without her conversation these relationships have the capacity to be so tense complicated and mutually disappointing because most of us carry in our heads an idealised version of the family and the home home is a place of welcome and refuge families are happy supportive intimate and nuclear in practice modern life and our conflicting desire to be free to achieve in the outside world makes both of these ideals hard to achieve if we can we call in outsiders to support us and fill in the gaps they must do the tending tasks that family members would once willingly have done but we cannot love them for it we fear that they do it only because they are paid and the act of payment itself makes us inclined to feel suspicious and critical of our employees since we are buying something that we want why cant we get the perfect version of it why is there a hair on the floor or a child with homework unfinished conversely if all our expectations are met we may be even more unsettled domestic perfection can make us feel dangerously inadequate or even displaced gardeners who take too much pride in their gardens cleaners who are too proprietorial about their houses or nannies who are loved more than parents are all prone to being sacked these changes in our domestic arrangements are all part of what the american sociologist arlie hochschild calls the commercialisation of intimate life as her research shows in the united states the process of employing strangers to do what were once intimate household tasks has gone further than we yet have here there are companies who will write letters to your friends organise your family photograph albums and ceremonially scatter your relations ashes in the sea in your absence women living near your elderly parents will if paid call in to have the cups of tea or walks with them that you are too busy to manage yourself and parents who are worried about how well they are performing as family members can call in a professional evaluation company family for an indepth analysis of where they might be able to improve a common recommendation is the family memory package where a parent usually a father is encouraged to undertake activities with his children specifically in order to remember them later the question of memory is central to the issue of what we are doing when we give so many domestic tasks to others those tasks may be performed efficiently or even magnificently well but what we may miss when we absent ourselves is both the intrinsic satisfaction of the process itself the cakemaking the nappychanging or the herbgrowing and the chance to build longlived relationships with the people we love while we do so instead we may be creating lives full of fractured experiences for ourselves and more important for our children,2006-07,single mother living south london yearold son advertising household help web say want livein

though overshadowed by ruth kellys integration drivelfest yesterdays release of new research about work and fatherhood still received some media attention based on indepth interviews with fathers in professional and managerial jobs and on data from the british household panel study the headline findings of a team from bristol university were that most men do not change their working patterns because of having children and that they would rather have more flexible working hours than fewer of them there is no evidence that new involved fathers are adopting a female model of parenthood with parttime work and high levels of childcare said the sociologist dr esther dermott who led the research in a press release what professional men value most about their jobs is their ability to control their working hours so that they can leave early to go to school functions or parents meetings and this flexibility was also what other men most wanted these conclusions are significant and interesting but do they mean that new dad is and always will be a myth and a fantasy predictably those obsessed with reinforcing and policing what they regard as natural and traditional boundaries between the sexes have been excitedly spinning that this is so and using them as a stick with which to beat familyfriendly measures such as statefunded paternity leave what though can the less blinkered conclude the bristol findings certainly suggest a mismatch between some government thinking and what fathers desire one that may be exploited by the conservatives should their announcement also yesterday about flexible working practices appeal to the nations working dads but for broader insights into where fatherhood is going it seems productive to ponder the new research in the light of other work in this field at first glance the bristol discoveries seem at odds with for example a report from the equal opportunities commission saying that fathers are now doing a third of all childcare and to which i responded look more closely though and this may not be so that many fathers do not want to spend less time at work on account of having kids does not necessarily mean that their approach to fatherhood has not changed in comparison with those of previous generations of dads in other words it does not follow that not wanting to go to work for fewer hours on account of being dads means they do not spend more time looking after their kids or going about it in new ways the research in question also seems indirectly to confirm something else that success at work remains a bedrock priority for men and the male identity that this of itself remains unaltered by the fact of fatherhood should come as no surprise bringing home the bacon became a key paternal duty after the industrial revolution separated mens labour from the home and the legacy of this piece of cultural custom and practice is neither dishonourable nor likely to lose its purchase in a hurry also to necessarily state the obvious for as long as it is women rather than men who become pregnant give birth and breastfeed it is going to make sense for many couples for mister rather than missus to take on the extra burden of breadwinning after miss or master is born especially as he is likely to be the bigger earner meanwhile a lot of men still lack confidence in their ability to be good with kids while plenty of women surely feel ambivalent about change given that the domestic realm childcare included has such a history of being womens space in short the road towards new and improved forms of fatherhood is a long and slow one and it was always going to be that way so its worth restating what the journey is for or ought to be for it is not as the sneerers say to turn men into women neither is it to destroy the traditional family to go against nature in some way it is to help with the still larger task of helping families become warmer more stable egalitarian and democratic institutions in which dad is not a remote outsider the fact that he does not yet want to spend less time at work doesnt mean that change in that direction cannot happen or is not already happening ps

fathers may take time off immediately after the birth of a child but they soon settle back into their old routines and remain at work as long as childless male colleagues according to a study published today the research carried out by the university of bristol calls into question the idea that modern fathers want to work fewer hours so they can spend more caring and sharing time with their children the suspicion is that stories of fathers taking on parttime and reduced hours are exceptional cases rather than substantial movements says esther dermott lead investigator for the governmentfunded study there is no evidence she says that men are adopting a more female model of parenthood combining parttime work or shorter working hours with raising children contrary to popular belief fathers do not work shorter hours than nonfathers and nor do they want to a quarter of all men want to work fewer hours less than want to work more hours and the remainder want no change those preferences do not change when they become fathers the study found dr dermott said this confirms my earlier study which found that what professional men valued most about their jobs was their ability to control their working hours so that they could leave early to go to school functions or parents meetings and this flexibility was also what other men most wanted men traditionally took a holiday around the time a baby was expected but dr dermott said early evidence suggested the introduction of two weeks paid paternity leave at a week or of earnings if the father earns less than that had had a disappointing takeup these policies may simply not be what fathers want dr dermott said given the notable alteration in working hours around birth paternity leave paid at a rate commensurate with earnings could be embraced however measures such as unpaid parental leave especially when intended for periods not around the time of birth are likely to be much less successful if fathers were accommodated recognised encouraged to take more leave or work differently that would encourage employers to take parenting more seriously the findings were based on data from the british household panel study covering different age groups and the national child development survey which studies people born in adrienne burgess from the information centre fathers direct said there were various reasons why fathers did not take leave the most serious because they cant afford to while it is paid at such low levels there is evidence that new fathers who dont have flexible working or a sense of autonomy over their schedule are more likely to suffer from stress or depression,2006-08,father may take time immediately birth child soon settle back old routine remain work long childless male

theres a curious tale from gulf news in dubai where the authorities have announced plans for taxis with pink roofs pink seats and interiors and other features to give the vehicles a feminine touch the taxis will have female drivers and theyll be helpfully deployed outside the places women frequent such as shopping malls and maternity hospitals they will only pick up female passengers or women with young children the reaction from readers on the gulf news website has been mainly enthusiastic and theres no doubt that many women in the gulf feel uncomfortable with male taxi drivers but is this really the solution combine the gendercolour stereotyping with the assumption that women are only good for shopping and having babies and ugh its enough to make you cringe if women feel threatened by male taxi drivers one of the more sceptical gulf news readers suggests is not the answer to deal with that before getting more taxis for women it seems to me though that the pink taxis scheme is just one small example of a much bigger social dilemma in the more conservative parts of the middle east womens rights and needs have been consistently ignored and at one level womenonly projects like this seek to redress the balance on the other hand they also perpetuate genderbased discrimination and perhaps even reinforce it many of these projects appear reasonable enough until you draw an analogy with race the womenonly factories in saudi arabia for instance are generally presented as a progressive development but would they be considered progressive if they selected employees on the basis of race rather than gender if racial apartheid is unacceptable is sexual apartheid ok,2006-08,curious tale gulf news dubai authority announced plan taxi pink roof pink seat interior feature give vehicle feminine touch taxi female driver theyll helpfully deployed outside place woman frequent shopping mall maternity hospital pick female passenger woman young child reaction reader gulf news website ha mainly enthusiastic doubt many woman gulf feel uncomfortable male taxi driver really solution combine gendercolour stereotyping assumption woman good shopping baby ugh enough make cringe woman feel threatened male taxi driver one sceptical gulf news reader suggests answer deal getting taxi woman seems though pink taxi scheme one small example much bigger social dilemma conservative part middle east womens right need consistently ignored one level womenonly project like seek redress balance hand also perpetuate genderbased discrimination perhaps even reinforce many project appear reasonable enough draw analogy race womenonly factory saudi arabia instance generally presented progressive development would considered progressive selected employee basis race rather gender racial apartheid unacceptable sexual apartheid ok,"['curious', 'tale', 'gulf', 'news', 'dubai', 'authority', 'announced', 'plan', 'taxi', 'pink', 'roof', 'pink', 'seat', 'interior', 'feature', 'give', 'vehicle', 'feminine', 'touch', 'taxi', 'female', 'driver', 'theyll', 'helpfully', 'deployed', 'outside', 'place', 'woman', 'frequent', 'shopping', 'mall', 'maternity', 'hospital', 'pick', 'female', 'passenger', 'woman', 'young', 'child', 'reaction', 'reader', 'gulf', 'news', 'website', 'ha', 'mainly', 'enthusiastic', 'doubt', 'many', 'woman', 'gulf', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'male', 'taxi', 'driver', 'really', 'solution', 'combine', 'gendercolour', 'stereotyping', 'assumption', 'woman', 'good', 'shopping', 'baby', 'ugh', 'enough', 'make', 'cringe', 'woman', 'feel', 'threatened', 'male', 'taxi', 'driver', 'one', 'sceptical', 'gulf', 'news', 'reader', 'suggests', 'answer', 'deal', 'getting', 'taxi', 'woman', 'seems', 'though', 'pink', 'taxi', 'scheme', 'one', 'small', 'example', 'much', 'bigger', 'social', 'dilemma', 'conservative', 'part', 'middle', 'east', 'womens', 'right', 'need', 'consistently', 'ignored', 'one', 'level', 'womenonly', 'project', 'like', 'seek', 'redress', 'balance', 'hand', 'also', 'perpetuate', 'genderbased', 'discrimination', 'perhaps', 'even', 'reinforce', 'many', 'project', 'appear', 'reasonable', 'enough', 'draw', 'analogy', 'race', 'womenonly', 'factory', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'instance', 'generally', 'presented', 'progressive', 'development', 'would', 'considered', 'progressive', 'selected', 'employee', 'basis', 'race', 'rather', 'gender', 'racial', 'apartheid', 'unacceptable', 'sexual', 'apartheid', 'ok']",140
one in four adult women has experienced at least one physical assault from a partner during adulthood and one incident of domestic violence is reported to the police every minute the findings of a study recently presented to frontline workers shows there are still many barriers to women seeking help for themselves and their children it is not simply a case as some would argue of she just wont leave him the lottery funded a threeyear study domestic abuse women seeking help dash a collaboration between sheffield university and the sheffield domestic abuse forum a multiagency partnership to combat domestic abuse the results of a population survey from the study confirmed a wideranging ignorance of the extent and commonplace aspect of domestic violence a questionnaire was sent to people in sheffield roughly half of which were men and half were women of these valid questionnaires were returned a response rate some were from women only of the respondents were aware of the one in four statistic outlined above most believed that the proportion of women that had experienced domestic violence was one in every the majority of men and women considered that punching sex without consent slapping threats of violence and verbal aggression represented acts of domestic violence and more than half identified controlling social life in the same way however women were significantly more likely than men to see sex without consent verbal aggression and controlling social life as abuse most respondents believed that drugs and alcohol abuse were a major cause of male violence and significantly more women than men believed that men were violent in order to be in control however of all respondents believed that women provoke male violence the survey respondents placed domestic violence seventh in a list of eight crimes that threaten public safety behind car crime and burglary this highlights surely that previous public awareness campaigns have not been successful the successful intervention of health and social care agencies is fundamental to the governments agenda to tackle domestic violence with this in mind we also surveyed social services and health managers along with medical directors from hospitals and primary care trusts we asked about their organisations policies for defining identifying and tackling domestic violence the existence of protocols for routine screening of all service users where women are asked if they have experienced domestic violence and organisations training and awareness of specialist resources the results from the third that replied suggest that most agencies do have policies and procedures in place and some such as accident and emergency departments operate universal screening procedures on all women service users but what of frontline health and social care workers whose vigilance and support can make all the difference to womens safety some social workers midwives health visitors gps and accident and emergency staff returned our third set of questionnaires most were able to describe in broad terms the kinds of behaviours that constituted domestic abuse however most considered that they rarely encountered domestic violence in their practice where then are all the women who have experienced domestic abuse reluctance to pry survey respondents admitted their reluctance to pry despite their agencies policies they were confused about what to do if they did suspect domestic abuse they were unaware of what support to expect if they took action to help an abused woman some frontline workers acknowledged a fear of embarrassment should they mistakenly suggest domestic abuse many were unaware of existing agency screening procedures these results point to a practice vacuum which may account for the low incidence of detected cases after receiving the questionnaire several respondents sought out the policies and procedures of which they had hitherto been unaware we interviewed of the professional respondents after the survey they revealed varied attitudes to the causes of domestic violence one male gp believed that couples might still love each other in spite of the abuse a female social worker asserted that men perpetrate this kind of violence to do something to orchestrate their power or get their identity back following unemployment or poverty another female social worker concurred that men might feel threatened by certain things which might lead them to violence the study demonstrated that training for frontline workers is important but that the sheer range of issues they face in their work means it has been a low priority for them and their employers the accounts of women we interviewed who were seeking help with domestic violence issues underscored the frontline workers dilemmas the women said they experienced many pitfalls particularly the lack of joined up services telling a family doctor about the abuse for example did not automatically precipitate followup support from social workers or health visitors this is disturbing because disclosing violence demands courage from victims to overcome the real fear of reprisals another genuine worry was that social services could take victims children into care anna gupta lecturer in child care social work at royal holloway university of london knows from her own research that every case of domestic violence is different she believes that the government should consider less formal family and community provision in its support of domestic violence victims exercising every caution before social services consider taking children into care while domestic violence does cross the social spectrum some women are especially vulnerable some of women interviewed who had had more than one abusive partner also had parents and grandparents who had suffered or perpetrated domestic violence abusive relationships do not end with the woman taking refuge women do return to their abusers sometimes voluntarily sometimes because their hiding place is discovered returning home for whatever reason has in cases led to further abuse or even to murder considering the dash findings what can the government do to stop domestic violence and to protect its victims it should begin by targeting public awareness campaigns at men frontline workers must be included in the planning and delivery of policy and training routine screening would involve putting openended nonjudgmental questions in a relaxed private environment to all female service users without their partners present informing them of the high overall incidence of domestic violence and making it clear that everyone is being asked the same questions this screeing should be undertaken by frontline workers particularly during and after pregnancy when domestic violence can begin or is exacerbated this might go some way to shrinking the shocking statistics of domestic violence in britain paula nicolson author of the dash report

the banning of the latest fhm cover at new yorks grand central station due to its depiction of what is apparently known as an underboob tells us something crucial about the depiction of women in a patriarchal society and its relationship to the commercial marketplace unfortunately im not sure what that crucial thing is but i do find it surprising that there is a region of the female body called the underboob i had previously thought i had a complete mental map of all the female erogenous zones until the discovery of underboob i believe i had worked out the perfect formula for identifying them it was simple and it was accurate it goes thus everything on a suitable female body is an erogenous zone apart from the following ears armpits esp unshaven nostrils palms but to return to the underboob and its implications the sudden emergence of this hitherto unidentified region of skin has introduced a whole new dimension to the study and categorisation of the erogenous zone for it appears that the breast has now been bitted grand central station apparently will happily accept sideboob on to its newsstands and positively welcome cleavage that classic oldschool erogenous zone which in fact is not breast at all but the space between breasts but underboobs are considered a discrete and separate element to the remainder of the breast this principle of bitting if widely adopted has farreaching implications previously for example i like most of my gender had eroticised womens lips full pink moist slightly parted they held almost as much promise as the real thing now it becomes clear that the concept lips is merely a linguistic construction one could just as easily bit the lips into underlip overlip supralip the cleft between nose and overlip and intralip where the two make contact how did it all get so complicated in the beginning there was face and then lo there was cleavage and in the th century there was ankle and as hemlines rose there came legs and there you had it your basic staples your meat and potatoes of male fantasy but since the s erogenous zones have been multiplying at a dizzying rate yes there was the odd lacuna of the late s in which if you moved in any kind of remotely leftwing circles all identifiably erotic female bodily zones were considered an expression of patriarchy and the male gaze and thus abolished but since then it has become hard for a man to keep up with the parts of the anatomy by which one is meant to be stimulated as s puritanism wore off it was madonna who almost singlehandedly reerogenised the female body first the midriff in her holiday phase then biceps as she mutated into a material girl the material in this instance apparently being granite and finally in her blonde ambition phase she rediscovered breasts with a remarkable flair for fetishistic corsetry after madonna redefined the female body as empowering rather than exploitative a whole raft of erogina not a real word but then neither is underboob arrived there was for instance the collagen bee sting or trout pout and the lower back suitably decorated by a slinky tattoo the socalled tramp stamp and most recently the upper pubis as revealed by lowslung jeans there was even a doomed attempt in the early s to make the toes erotic the risibly christened toe cleavage the emergence of these zones was facilitated by the fashion industry in the case of the pubis and lower back the dominance of the thong and lowslung jeans and in the case of toes sandal manufacturers recently sleeves being cropped to the elbow is the latest attempt to eroticise a nominal body zone although forearm and wrist as far as i am concerned are almost toelike in their inadaptability to this particular purpose does this mean it is all out of control will it become a freeforall where more and more flesh is exposed until only the interior of the labia is taboo no because taboo is necessary for the whole show to work the real erogenous zones those ones that you only get to see in the privacy of the bedroom or on your internet search engine will always remain out of view because without them all the other erogenous zones which to a greater or lesser extent point to imply or reflect the real naughty bits will simply vanish they depend on each other thus limits are established and maintained so in conclusion we need a return to basics i propose the launch of a campaign for real erotic zones rezones this would involve a kind of british standard kitemark that would attest to the authenticity of an erogenous zone legs and breasts would be shooins lips and hair we could talk about as for underboobs my instinct is that the judgment will go against them why because underboobs are an invention of the glamour industry desperate for new patches of flesh for women to reveal and excite gullible men thus the oncesimple world of a nicely turned ankle or an elegant shoulder is being turned into a nightmarish kaleidoscope of hot buttons

nearly twothirds of fathers of newborn children do not take their full entitlement of paternity leave an opinion poll reveals today most said they could not afford to lose income at a time of heavy pressure on the family budget but a significant proportion said their careers would suffer if employers got the impression that they were losing interest in their work the poll of more than fathers was carried out by yougov for the savings bank ing direct it found of new fathers took the full statutory entitlement of two weeks paternity leave but took less than a week the pollsters said money or a lack of it appears to be the key reason why dads turn down leave with citing financial considerations as a key motive for staying at work fathers have a legal entitlement to two weeks paternity leave during the first six weeks of the childs life but they may be paid as little as a week unless employers offer more generous terms this could mean that a father on average earnings would lose over the fortnight other reasons for not taking full paternity leave included lack of sympathy from employers with of fathers fearing their career would suffer if they took too much time off saying their employer was not parentfriendly and saying they were needed back at work urgently results varied across britain with in london taking the full entitlement compared with in scotland the results differed from findings by the equal opportunities commission suggesting that of fathers took at least two weeks leave around the birth of their child but the eoc said the results were not inconsistent most of these fathers in the eoc poll used part of their annual leave to secure the time off to avoid relying on low rates of paternity pay fathers in lowincome families are less likely to receive full pay from their employer to top up statutory paternity pay and fewer are taking two weeks leave said the commission targeted support from the government is needed so that all fathers can afford to

employees looking to become parents in the next year will find the law has changed in their favour from the beginning of october the work and families act officially replaces its predecessor the act is the culmination of months of consultation with various work groups and unions in an effort to properly recognise the importance of family commitments to the countrys economy probably the most significant part of the legislation is that maternity and adoption leave have been extended from six months statutory or ordinary maternity pay to nine months paid leave part of which can also be taken by the father rather than the mother ultimately the government aims to fund a full years paid leave for maternity and adoption although the regulations come into force now they will only affect mothers whose babies are due on or after april next year those whose babies arrive prematurely before that date will still qualify for nine months maternity pay while those whose due date is prior to april whose babies are born after will not qualify the same applies for set adoption dates who pays maternity pay is met by the employer and refunded by the government depending on the size of the organisation the department of work and pensions repays between and of the figure to the employer with smaller organisations getting greater compensation this means if youre employed by a very small company you need not feel overly concerned about the impact of your leave on budgets as your employer will be more than compensated your employer may also have its own provisions for maternity leave that are more generous than those outlined in the law so its worth checking those out when planning your finances the rules set out here are those in the new legislation and the minimum you can expect your firm to do amounts and dates for the first six weeks of leave you will receive of your current pay after this time you will receive a week or of your salary if this is lower previously these payments ended after six months but they have now been extended to nine months after this period you can take an additional three months off but your employer does not have to pay you during that period should a mother wish to return to employment after six months the childs father will be entitled to take paternity leave for the extra three months in fact although the first sixweek period is protected for women after that date either parent can take paid leave at the flat rate the same rights apply for samesex couples and adopters just as the legislation includes plans to increase paid leave to a year it is also looking to extend paternity leave entitlement to weeks although it does not set a date for these to come into force the new rules also mean your job is safeguarded for nine months if you opt to take a full year off work your company may be able to move you into a different role but it has to be similar to the one you already had job protection trade unions are concerned that such job protection doesnt last the full year were concerned because mothers are very vulnerable during this period says rebecca gill of the tuc it can mean that a lot of mums go back to inferior roles if they choose to take the full year the same applies to fathers who may choose not to take leave rather than risk going back to a job which is different to their old one the tuc is also concerned about another element of the act which gives employers the right to request flexible working what it means is that parents have the right to request flexible working and by rights employers have to listen to them and provide a proper written response within a certain time period says ms gill but you cant enshrine a right to ask in law and in practical terms you can only take it to tribunal on a technicality say if the employer hadnt responded in writing within the given period the new rules give parents the right to work occasional days without forfeiting an entire week of maternity pay parents are allowed up to keeping in touch days for which they will be paid the same rate as maternity pay as the tuc point out this is less than the minimum wage and employees might

i have been wondering in what context the issue of single parenthood might be raised at the labour party conference whenever lone parenthood is discussed it is always seen as a problem that society needs to fix but no magic wand can perform that trick single parenthood is here to stay and the work and pensions secretary john hutton achieved nothing by trying to break a socalled taboo by saying out loud in a speech that twoparent families are best talk about stating the obvious mr hutton also said that children raised in unemployed singleparent families are five times more likely to end up in poverty than the children of single parents with fulltime jobs but even if a single parent does work full time the chances are they wont earn much single parents are times less likely to be in the per week earnings bracket than two parents would be most working single parents earn a piffling to a week incredibly there is a backlash against giving more money to single parents in case it encourages us to go it alone a recent study from the european community household panel says there is a direct link between the welfare system and the number of loneparent families this is based on the fact that in the uk we lead europe with of our households headed by a single parent and we nearly top the charts with the amount of dosh we give too currently a year but thats still just a week the study concluded that for every a state offers in benefits to lone parents the incidence of single mothers rockets by but at the same time single parents in the uk are poorer than ever before and thats hardly an encouragement to start rearing children on ones own a handwringing of children living in poverty are from lone parent households yet in that figure stood at just the shocking truth is that lone parents have not participated in an improvement of living standards experienced by the majority of families over the past years or so on the whole we equate single mothers as bad feckless and manipulative and single dads as sacrificing heroes but its not fair to accuse mothers of knowing how to milk the system of whatever benefits are available from my experience there is definitely not a freeforall for single mums before i left our home for good my ex helpfully suggested i get myself on a council list right away and as i was not in a position to argue i did just that like everyone else in my situation i was given a housing application form to fill in and was honest about my lessthanbrilliant position no job no home no savings and a baby council homes are allocated on a points system you have to accrue around points in order to stand a hope in hell of getting somewhere i got around i called the housing officer for advice on how to boost my points depressingly she told me there was nothing i could do unless you become an asylum seeker she added aside from the a month in child benefit that is given to everyone rich or poor i am not eligible for anything from the government i havent received any tax credits for the past two years because i made the mistake of getting a fulltime job and suddenly it transpired i had been overpaid for the previous year and so was entitled to zilch and that is despite the fact that my childcare fees then started to rocket because i was out of the house all day earning at the same time a friend who has a oneyearold baby and a husband who earns a year as a professional poker player gets the full whack of around in child tax credits of course gambling proceeds are not taxed but despite telling the benefits office of the amount they earn they still get as much as a single parent would my friend even gets tokens for free milk thrown in which she has told the benefits office she doesnt need and they go straight in the bin because shes buys it herself makes sense doesnt it and now the government is hoping to get more single parents back into work currently single parents only have to work three hours a week before they are eligible for benefits compared to hours for those in a couple incredibly questions are being raised as to whether this is fair but surely having two parents makes looking after the children easier it stands to reason that single parents need more help than two because when there is only one parent then thats instantly half and usually much less the money coming into the household because when you are on your own its harder to organise or to afford childcare and because you simply need the extra cash apparently john huttons dad walked out on his mum when he was so when he said that for most parents lone parenthood brings powerful emotions of regret guilt and real hardship it may have been from the heart but aside from tax credits that not every single mother even gets what else is the government actually doing before the government starts trying to coax single parents back into work the ageold issues of affordable childcare and flexible working hours need to be tackled and thats aside from the discrimination some single parents find themselves suffering from if they admit to employers that they are on their own yes in an ideal world we should persuade couples to stay together yes its best for the kids but unless you turn back the clock to a time when women and men stayed together because they had to not because they wanted to when divorce was difficult and young single mums were sent to asylums then single parenthood is here to stay very few women that stagger out from a maternity ward with a new bundle in their arms believe they will end up alone why would anyone choose to be a single parent unless they had to you rarely hear the bare facts of how lonely financially difficult and at times almost annihilating life as a single parent can be the lone parent and yes more often than not it is the mother faces an endless barrage of finger pointing and blame and few have the time or energy to fight back we are too busy trying to keep the future generation fed clothed safe and happy,2006-09,wondering context issue single parenthood might raised labour party conference whenever lone parenthood discussed always seen problem society need fix

from all the talk of newage buggypushing waitingattheschoolgate fathers youd think kids would almost be sick of the sight of daddy so often do they see him youd think so but the reality is rather different far from taking time out for the family the majority of men continue to work the same hours after they have children and whats more new research suggests that most of them dont even want to work fewer hours amid the paternityleave fanfare its a surprising result even the author of the report bristol university sociologist dr esther dermott was taken aback by the findings i suppose i wasnt that surprised about professional and managerial men because ive found it time and time again in previous interviews but i was surprised to find it right across the board in other roles and occupations children in the uk see less of their dads than their counterparts elsewhere in europe where fathers tend to work more reasonable hours but its not just the kids who lose out the fact that new fathers dont reduce their working hours also means that the burden of childcare is much more likely to fall on the mother rather than being shared dermott says for families reliant on a dual income this can be exhausting for women not only do they have to go to work but theyre the ones expected to negotiate with their employers about working childfriendly hours and going home when childcare plans fall through when they finally get home they do most of the childrearing a recent allaboutyoucom poll found that of working mothers still have daytoday responsibility for raising children worse still a study from the economic and social research council this summer found that organisations rarely recognise these pressures that women are under juggling multiple roles at work and home the result is that mothers burn out with the study finding that many womens health is adversely affected even if youre a woman without kids you may find yourself indirectly affected by the fact that fathers dont ease up on their working hoursif it was just as acceptable for men to leave early because of caring responsibilities then youd finally change the whole culture around women in the workplace and how they are viewed in terms of career progression and pay compared with men i think thats an important implication of my research dermott explains in fact many men actually increase the time theyre at work when their offspring come along we did a longitudinal survey that found a significant proportion of men said they would decrease their hours when the baby came along but in fact most did more says diane houston professor of psychology at the university of kent fathers now work the longest hours of any group in british society largely to blame is the perception that to progress you have to be seen to be working fulltime and better still overtime she believes presenteeism is seen as proof of commitment in our society she explains since the majority of women reduce their hours when they have a baby the pressure on men to get promoted faster can be enormous because they need to make up the income loss women themselves may also be culpable she adds despite all the talk about the need to share childcare between mothers and fathers nine out of women are inclined to say theyd like to do it more than the men when it comes down to it more than half of the uks new fathers dont even take the full twoweeks paternity leave that theyre legally entitled to a yougov study carried out for savings firm ing direct found this summer fortyeight per cent said financial considerations were a key reason for staying at work unsympathetic bosses featured as another contributing factor and work responsibilities were also seen as a deterrent with one in saying they feared their career would suffer if they took too much time off one in eight said his employer was not parent friendly dinosaur dads the previous generation of corporate men supported by stayathome wives are generally the worst at encouraging this kind of office culture while bosses have finally woken up to the idea of employing mothers few seem to realise that this means they now employ a different kind of father rebecca clake adviser at the chartered institute of personnel and development adds that colleagues can take this kind of attitude too macho cultures are still common even in companies that have the best policies in the world its just that these policies get stuck in a handbook in a dusty drawer or on the internet with the consequence that men dont feel they can take them up some men who are genuinely keen to be more handson fathers even take to fathering by stealth they may use excuses such as offsite client meetings as cover for time spent looking after their children rather than risk appearing uncommitted or less masculine in front of colleagues braver chaps have taken to asking employers for flexible hours but they are still far more likely than women to have their requests turned down according to the tuc its latest figures show that employers look more favourably on requests from females the report concludes that employers reluctance to grant men more flexibility heaps pressure on mothers and reinforces the idea that only women should juggle childcare and work dermott agrees her study found that while men dont appear to want to work shorter hours many do like the idea of working more flexibly employeecontrolled forms of flexibility mean they can do things like leave early to go to school functions or parents meetings she says brian walsh management development manager for bts global services is a case in point i have no desire to work fewer hours but when i realised i hardly saw my two children i became more and more attracted to the idea of working flexibly says walsh who lives in tring hertfordshire but like many men walsh had to leave his previous job to achieve this now at bt he has more control over when he works and how often he works from home this morning i played chess with my son before coming into the office and often i can get home to pick them up from school and make up the hours in the evening sometimes i spend whole afternoons helping out at the school not only does it make him feel less guilty as a father but his wife angela also benefits if one of the children is ill its no longer me thats expected to drop everything we share daytoday parenting tasks a lot more brian was never around when our firstborn was young he was never able to see her in assemblies or dancing displays but thats all changed and i think we work much better as a family the government is also starting to recognise the scale of the problem the government plans from april next year to offer fathers the opportunity to choose to take up to weeks

the government should raise the minimum wage boost child benefit and introduce compulsory pay audits in all companies to allow women to raise the families they want the minister for justice harriet harman urged yesterday ms harman who confirmed that she is considering standing for labours deputy leadership said women were delaying motherhood and having fewer children than they wanted because of the pressures of work speaking at a unison meeting at the tuc conference in brighton she stressed that feeling torn between work and home was not the preserve of middle class career women this is a particular problem for women who are in low paid low status jobs if youre the boss or in senior management you have choices you dont if youre in a cleaning job or on a production line she said many women feel they have to put off having their first baby because they cant afford it and theyll lose out at work they worry because physically it doesnt get any easier to have your babies when youre older these women felt they could not afford to have larger families she said its all right if youre well off and can afford the time off work and the cost of more than one child in a nursery or afterschool club but many families just cant ms harman said the government should consider paying the same child benefit for subsequent children as for the first she also argued that closing the pay gap would be crucial allowing fathers to play a greater role in child rearing we should be looking at a target for ending unequal pay looking at the role the minimum wage can play in tackling unequal pay and compulsory pay audits in the private as well as public sector she told the meeting ms harmans deputy leadership campaign would almost certainly focus on her appeal to women mps unionists and party members but her proposals also reflect the wider battle for the support of women earlier this week ruth kelly communities secretary announced that she would implement almost all the recommendations of the women and work commission such as introducing union equality representatives in the workplace meanwhile david cameron again suggested that the conservatives might follow germany by introducing a transferable tax allowance enabling couples to earn over taxfree each year a woman who chose to stay at home could sign over her tax allowance to her partner but the tory leader

muslim girls are forging ahead at school but hit a brick wall of discrimination when they enter the workplace the equal opportunities commission says today in a report on its twoyear investigation of the experiences of women from ethnic minority communities across britain it found that girls of pakistani and bangladeshi origin of whom are muslim have overtaken white boys in performance at gcse with a higher proportion achieving five good passes at grade c or above despite lower family incomes they are also rapidly catching up with white girls black girls of africancaribbean origin are not far behind and already outperform boys from their own ethnic group the eoc said girls at from all the minority communities have higher aspirations than their white contemporaries to progress to skilled jobs requiring degrees or long periods of training nearly want to work fulltime after leaving education balancing employment with having a family but their ambitions are thwarted when they enter the labour market they get lower pay and fewer opportunities to reach managerial positions one in six young pakistani women is often asked at job interviews about plans for marriage and children or the attitude of a husband or partner towards her going to work one in eight young bangladeshi and black africancaribbean women face similar questions about their private lives compared with one in

no doubt fay weldon is right in her new book what makes women happy in urging women to delight their partners with phoney orgasms just fake she says happy generousminded women not too hung up about emotional honesty fake and her claim that the more highly educated you are the more likely you are to fake orgasm will only im sure have added to the number of brainy types who have already memorised her suggested postcoital compliment you are so clever presumably it can be customised in the event of congress with john prescott or similar one might exclaim you are a credit to the trade union movement for example or simply but effectively hurrah concerning chocolate however i find her manual less persuasive for being so much more conventional coming last in weldons list of the six things which she asserts make women happy chocolate gets a whole chapter to itself separately from food it features familiar chocolate factoids such as six women out of preferring chocolate to sex and the claim that chocolate is addictive addictive to women that is men for reasons that scientists have yet to uncover appear better equipped to resist unlike her innovative tips for sexual bliss weldons observations on chocolate hardly differ from the standard womens magazine premise that all women are slaves to it probably even more tiresomely chocoholics and for some reason convinced that their weakness is more endearing than shameful although it would be disconcerting to hear a woman boast about being enslaved by her insatiable appetite for scotch eggs say or for gobstoppers or proclaiming that she preferred bacon to sex an immoderate interest in chocolate has over the past few years become a defining female quality even among individuals who unlike dawn french have no need to convince themselves that the pleasures of excessive chocolate consumption outweigh the manifest disadvantages to health appearance and life expectancy of course as weldon demonstrates in her book with its other sections on food mostly pudding caramelised bananas and shopping shoes it is not unusual for women to advertise certain weaknesses presumably because they believe perhaps correctly that the relevant peccadillo extravagantly confirms their femininity hence those spreads in the daily mail where five women done up in jewels heels and shiny evening dresses chorus something like weve all spent on pants or were all greedy blond trollops though such confessions are not a mail monopoly one recalls an observer piece by kimberley fortier in her preblunkett era boasting about how she begged hubby for an handbag the dear scatty spendthrift but even now it is rare to hear the mails twittering shoppers confess to liking their bags bras or stilettoes more than sex or arguing that the serotonin hidden in the leather acted on their oestrogen to make them do it or volunteering their chronic spending habit as chocoholics bashfully admit to their habit as if it were a lovable tellingly vulnerable characteristic not so different from a propensity for tears or a reckless generosity towards beggars although the advertising industry can obviously take much of the credit for turning so many women consumers into outreach workers for cadbury and nestl it is indebted too to the hard work of many prominent independent chocolate proselytisers in particular to the humourists both male and female who have made such a rewarding theme out of womens relationship with this product and its supposed advantages over male company it is a convention among chocolates more vocal victims to insist on the helplessness of all women not just themselves in the face of its moodenhancing chemical compounds you gather that none but the most mannish unnaturally resolute of superwomen condi rice perhaps could defy the hypnotic power of a chocolate bar even william brown emptying every jar in the village sweetshop never argued that resistance was futile chocolate as most of us know by now contains many of the substances which keep us happy and tranquil the endorphins serotonin and so forth is how weldon puts it before honesty compels her to admit that youd have to take lbs of the stuff to get the effect of one marijuana reefer most of all as the majority of us also know chocolate contains a substance that is going to make us fat sugar in may australian researchers publishing in the journal of affective disorders found unsurprisingly that far from enhancing your mood offering redemption bringing comfort or providing an introduction to johnny depp chocolate is more likely to be associated with prolongation rather than cessation of a depressed mood and even those most determined to claim miraculous properties for their favourite sweet would probably admit that it is not really that much help when someone dies or the house is repossessed or you realise that gordon brown is going to be the next prime minister who cares chocolate comes under the heading of little treats of whatever gets you through the night weldon declares with a conviction that must banish for many readers any lingering reservations relating to dignity palm oil or the cadburys salmonella pipe more than that she says going further now than even dawn french spokesperson for the terrys chocolate orange in her wildest most chocolatefuddled tributes a taste for this confectionery amounts to delinquency a refusal to accept things as they are boredom with the status quo lets do it this way not that and so we end up with carts trains cars aircraft television space travel nuclear fission modern warfare wind farms and boxes of chocolate it follows somehow that unlike her sexual desire a womans craving for chocolate cannot be ignored resisted or satisfied with a selfdenying substitute for the real thing an apple for instance or even a wind farm eat weldon urges eat and be damned what can one say you are so clever this week catherine saw pirates of the caribbean who would have thought that those undead sailors

telling women not to expect orgasms but to fake them and to praise their partner lavishly afterwards is not advice normally associated with a woman who has been in the vanguard of feminism for four decades nevertheless fay weldon gives short shrift to the views for which feminists have fought so bitterly over the years in her latest book she not only warns highflying women that they should expect to end up single she also suggests that sexual pleasure may be incompatible with highpowered careers and that women should simply accept they are less capable of being happy than men eighty per cent of women only sometimes or never experience orgasm facts are facts and there we are deal with it she writes in what makes women happy to be published this month by fourth estate according to weldon sensible members of the sisterhood should therefore follow the example so graphically set by the actor meg ryan in the movie when harry met sally and fake orgasms whenever necessary if you are happy and generousminded you will fake it and then leap out of bed and pour him champagne telling him you are so clever or however you express enthusiasm she says faking is kind to male partners otherwise they too may become anxious and so less able to perform do yourself and him a favour sister fake it weldon who created the slogan go to work on an egg in her early years as an advertising copywriter is seen as one of the englands most serious protofeminists thanks to her novels which include the fat womans joke female friends and the life and loves of a shedevil but while the writer now insists she has never aspired either to seriousness or feminism her new book has been condemned by her peers for discouraging todays young women to demand equality in the world it is they warn a counsel of defeat rather than of realism fay likes to be provocative said kate figes the british feminist and author but this places the onus on women again rather than men if a man cant cope with having a relationship with a happy woman who is content in her career then maybe its he who should raise his game these are one womans thoughts and shes a woman who is not young any more she comes from a different generation when fay was young a woman couldnt have a mortgage in her own name my daughter has never heard of fay weldon what she says is neither here nor there for young women today in fact weldons views are surprisingly similar to those of michael noer the news editor of forbescom who caused his own furore last week by advising male readers to steer clear of ambitious women or face a lifetime of misery and discord marry pretty women or ugly ones short ones or tall ones blondes or brunettes just whatever you do dont marry a woman with a career he wrote in an article that sparked outrage on both sides of the atlantic weldon however goes even further that noer she does not restrict herself to comments on how women should conduct their sex and careers instead her book covers eating social life the family and shopping the latter receives high praise the urge to acquire is in your genes she writes dont beat yourself up about it just remember pairs of shoes is fine but pairs is pushing it overall very few things make women happy and even fewer of them suggests weldon are matters of substance ask a woman what makes her happy and she comes up with a list sex food friends family shopping chocolate love tends not to get a lookin being in love sometimes makes an appearance men seem to surface as a source of aggravation she writes we are all still creatures of the cave although we live in loft apartments nature is in conflict with nurture women are born to be mothers weldon has however received some praise for her trenchant views the american feminist camille paglia lauded the book and its author for its courage its an important point that the career woman may often end up alone she said that scenario needs to be put to younger women as they begin making their choices about life faking orgasms is not a good idea but what shes actually talking about is trying to be supportive of men whose psyches are delicate and need to be protected men have a tremendous drive and are victim to all sorts of selfdoubt and it may well be that its a wise woman who realises that others however fear the book could have a detrimental impact on stcentury feminism this could have a really bad effect on young people said the author and academic maureen freely it will exacerbate the deepest concerns of the brilliant young women who i teach who are extremely worried that sooner or later they are going to have to pay for their independence and intellectual vigour because men dont like it we need to talk honestly about where women currently are after such a rapid period of social change but its not helpful to go back to crude arguments like these we all make compromises in our lives but thats what we need to do as human beings regardless of our gender but if i had to tell my own daughter to put up with what fay is suggesting i would be asking her to put up with situations which are quite frankly abusive other feminists however have suggested weldons book reveals something more interesting than her views on other women this book isnt the savvy political work it purports to be its a prose poem full of selfloathing about one womans own deep ambivalence about being a woman said janet halley a professor at harvard law school and author of split decisions how and why to take a break from feminism she represents women as being a nasty morass of repressed instinct i dont recognise any of the men or women i know in her reductionist portraits but its interesting to see a woman embracing her own misogyny feminists who have rocked the boat in a patriarchal society all heterosexual intercourse is rape because women as a group are not strong enough to give meaningful consent attributed to catherine mackinnon feminist author people call me a feminist whenever i express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute rebecca west when a woman reaches orgasm with a man she is only collaborating with the patriarchal system

how can i tell my father i want to leave the family business for years my father has been grooming me to take over the family manufacturing firm ive been working there quite happily but in the past two years ive realised my real passion is for law and i want to train as a lawyer my father will be devastated if i leave especially as theres no one else to take over the company he founded im torn between telling him how i feel which will leave him heartbroken or ignoring my own dreams to follow in his footsteps there are two kinds of agonising dilemma there are those where its almost impossible to decide which of two options is the better or least worse and there are those where the better option is reasonably obvious but much more painful your dilemma falls firmly into the latter category do a bit of rolereversal in your head suppose you were the father proud governor of a manufacturing firm and it was your son who discovered a passion for law however much you might have planned and dreamed can you honestly see yourself denying your son the opportunity to devote his only life to the career he so passionately craves could you really condemn a child of yours to an entire life of inevitable regret and almost certain resentment to put it brutally your father has devoted his own life to his own allabsorbing interest and theres no shame in that but you must have the freedom to do the same the sooner you accept all this and make it known to your father the better but by the time you tell him have some plans in place so hes not left facing an empty future you will clearly need to recruit from outside so identify an appropriate executive search company and draft a job description encourage your father to get involved as soon as possible it must be his choice expect him to be extremely hard to please hell instinctively judge everyone against his own son and find them wanting but as the interview process progresses he should gradually become more engaged and more positive if the plan works well your father will sooner or later find an applicant who impresses him he may even begin to hint that this particular applicant will do a better job than you would have done excuse him this entirely human piece of pettiness its a small price to pay for your freedom and anyway its probably true the arrangements for my secondment dont seem to be fair ive been seconded to work on a project at a government department from the charity i work for the secondment should be for four to five months while i appreciate its a great personal development opportunity the charity will also get something valuable in return the new skills and knowledge ill bring to the organisation when i get back the charity is getting a day remuneration for me as well but is not covering my post while im away my salary at the charity is and ill get no extra pay during the secondment while there are agreements between the charity and the government department i havent signed any secondee agreements though the working week at the secondment is hours minimum it is obvious ill be expected to work more though it is right to expect me to work hard as im being paid for my services my contract with the charity is for a hour week the secondment will involve travel doing site visits and overnight stays which then will mean ill be working at least hour days i think its unfair that the charity is basically making a profit out of me being away there are substantive changes in my working conditionshours of work so i think i should be offered some sort of compensation for this either a bonus or some extra holiday next year ive emailed my charity boss outlining my thoughts but am not hopeful and have now probably branded myself as a troublemaker id be grateful for any advice or information you seem to have an excellent case but must be careful not to overstate it you say its unfair the charity should be making a profit out of you but i dont think it is and anyway thats not the real point at issue theyre quite entitled to make a profit out of you and as a charity probably feel obliged to do so youre clearly very pleased to have been offered this opportunity if your employer had only recognised from the beginning that your secondment would entail longer working hours than your contract stipulated and had then volunteered some form of compensation youd have been perfectly happy thats the real issue and will be all the more telling if you leave it as simple as that the moment you find yourself thinking and another thing youve begun to let resentment colour your case im sorry you raised all this by email its a sensitive matter and as youve already appreciated you run the entirely unjustified risk of being labelled a troublemaker as always the only certain way of avoiding this is through a facetoface conversation only that way can you observe immediately how your points are being received and move swiftly to correct any misapprehension you simply cant control how written communications are received and by the time you have an opportunity to set the record straight it may be too late so whatever the response to your email do ask for a proper conversation with your boss stress your pleasure at this opportunity then ask given that the minimum hours required are a bit more than your contract specifies whether theres a chance of a bonus say or some extra holiday the less strident you are and the more measured and reasonable the better your chances and you really dont want to embark on this interesting secondment all churned up inside at the perceived inequity of it all jeremy bullmore writes a column for management today in which some of these questions first appeared for jeremys advice on a work issue email

the pay gap between men and women has narrowed to the smallest on record official data showed yesterday as the rise in womens wages again outstripped that of men but while the pay gap between the sexes is narrowing womens hourly rate of pay is still below that of men down from in average weekly pay for men was in april up by on a year earlier while pay for women was up to across the board average salaries have risen by this year to but the gap between rich and poor is continuing to grow the office for national statistics ons annual survey showed the figures showed that women lose more than over their working lives because earnings are stacked in favour of men the equal opportunities commission said jenny watson the commissions chairwoman said the figures proved the yearold legislation against sex discrimination was not working fast enough we need a new generation of laws placing a more active responsibility on employers to deliver equality she said the data is based on calculations which do not take into account the very high salaries of a tiny minority of boardroom executives and top footballers who are predominantly men and whose astronomical salaries distort the picture the guardians executive pay survey released this month showed that average pay in british boardrooms had jumped by during the past year compared with just for most of the population statisticians stress that the figures are a good picture of what is happening to the vast majority of people the annual salary splits into for men and for women the selfemployed are not included in the ons survey of people the figures showed that womens pay had increased faster than mens across of the income scale only at the top did mens pay growth outstrip that of women again because of the preponderance of men in top jobs in the city the ons provided data back to showing that the gender pay gap has narrowed massively back then a male manual worker earned an average of a week against for a woman doing the same job its figures also revealed that there is virtually no gender pay gap for people in their s the difference widens to around for people in their s peaks at for those in their s before dropping to for people aged to and for those older than this may reflect the fact that women tend to have children in their late s the gender pay gap has narrowed in eight of regions in the uk in northern ireland where it fell to almost zero the ons also released estimates of low pay which said that the number of people being less than the minimum wage rose by to this spring compared with a

when i was i worked in a pub and one evening the landlord and his son tried to rape me somehow i managed to get away i didnt report the incident to the police because back in it was widely recognised that women who reported a sexual assault were usually seen as liars i imagined that the police would have grilled me on why i was upstairs with two men i was taking a sneaky break and sharing a cigarette with the son and why i had been drinking i had had half a pint of lager for years afterwards while campaigning against rape and other crimes as a founder of the group justice for women i bitterly regretted not reporting my attackers my overwhelming feeling was guilt what if they succeeded next time now that guilt has been replaced by anger while in the s and s police and public attitudes towards rape victims seemed to be improving they more recently appear to be ricocheting backwards so much so that a couple of years ago i made a pact with myself which i vowed never to reveal publicly at this juncture i feel i must though if i was raped now i do not think i would report it to the police those who report their attackers and see their cases either discontinued or the defendant acquitted as happens with almost of reported rapes are now faced with the risk of being identified vilified and even criminalised anonymity was granted for rape victims in the s but last week for the first time a woman was publicly named and shamed after reporting a sexual assault lord campbellsavours the labour peer used parliamentary privilege to identify the woman during a debate on rape legislation in the house of lords describing her as a serial and repeated liar after a man initially found guilty of a sex attack on her had his conviction overturned her identity was then published in the daily mail the woman denies lying and says the only other allegations she has made are of sexual abuse by her father who is now dead and an assault by a boyfriend she had as a teenager then there was the yearold lap dancer recently jailed for six months for perverting the course of justice various footballers accused of roasting women have been exonerated while the women who accused them of rape are vilified as prostitutes and golddiggers in the past seven years women have also been sued for defamation by men accused of raping them after their cases were discontinued by the police and given the current media fixation on women bringing false allegations it would be easy to assume our prisons were full of innocent men in fact the conviction rate for rape is at an alltime low in complaints of rape were made and one in four men convicted in complaints were made but only one in was convicted a story i heard recently only confirmed for me that if the situation does not drastically improve not only are conviction rates going to fall further but reports to police will too shabnam an yearold asian woman had been drinking in a pub with her friend simon before walking to a local park where she agreed to have sex with him afterwards simon rang a friend who arrived a short while later with another man in tow all three raped shabnam during which one of the men filmed some of the activity on his mobile phone when the men left shabnam called and reported that she had been raped when the police arrived at the park the first thing the officer said was ugh she stinks of alcohol says shabnam once i told them i had been raped before aged their attitude changed as if i was a loose woman shabnam decided to withdraw her allegation and said she had not been raped the reason i said that was because of their attitude towards me they were so unsympathetic i could not face pursuing it the police escorted her home where her mother was waiting they said me and mum were speaking to each other in our native language says shabnam which we never do it was as if they were accusing us of trying to concoct a story the officer then asked shabnams mother if her daughter was mentally unsound the next day covered in bruises from the attacks shabnam went to the accident and emergency department of her local hospital there she was advised to attend a sexual assault centre where staff encouraged her to return to the police and make a statement police noted that she was under the care of the adolescent mental health services and after consulting her counsellor recorded her statement by video a process reserved for children and vulnerable witnesses two of the men were arrested some days later the police didnt even bother pursuing the third man one produced footage on his mobile phone of shabnam masturbating and giving oral sex to one of the men not surprisingly the mens accounts differed significantly from hers four weeks after the rapes shabnam was contacted by a police officer from the much lauded sapphire team set up to provide a specialist service to victims of sexual assault who asked her to come to the station as there had been developments when shabnam arrived she was arrested for perverting the course of justice i screamed so loudly says shabnam that my mother could hear me in the station waiting area police had decided shabnam was lying on the strength of the evidence captured on the mobile phone the fact that shabnam gave inconsistent accounts and because she had laughed intermittently throughout the process in march the government proposed that juries should be able to hear expert evidence on the way people behave after a serious sexual assault for example it is not uncommon for rape complainants to giggle in the witness box due to nerves and trauma i am convinced that i was treated so appallingly by the police says shabnam because i complained about the way they had treated me on the night of the rape frightened and confused shabnam accepted a caution from police terrified that she would end up in court with no anonymity to protect her a few weeks later she tried to kill herself i now want to challenge the caution because i feel i was bullied into it she says in a flyonthewall documentary police a complaint of rape showed a rape complainant being interviewed by thames valley police the police officers were shown bullying a woman into discontinuing her complaint against three men with one saying to her this is the biggest load of bollocks ive ever heard it provoked anger at the system and swiftly led to a change in police procedures the documentary showed that police were trained to test such claims rigorously at the initial reporting stage in a way that left the complainant feeling humiliated frightened and intimidated as a result police were retrained to handle complainants with respect and with the presumption of belief despite improvements there remains a culture within the police that assumes that women who report rape are lying one study found that a third of police assumed that at least a quarter of all reports were false research actually suggests though that numbers of false allegations of rape are no higher than for any other crime assumptions of false allegations are plainly dangerous one case discontinued by police as a false allegation involved a man who turned out to be a serial sex attacker eight years later he was convicted of rapes a police officer i spoke to who asked not to be named said that officers dealing with rape have recently been told to be rigorous in their pursuit of false allegations and root them out early on dave gee vice chairman of the association of chief police officers acpo working group on rape denies that police have been given such a directive and believes that false allegations of rape are rare there is no research whatsoever which suggests its endemic he says either way there should be no prejudging of victims a report of rape should be treated as rape if more cases such as shabnams occur we may as well forget about the criminal justice system and train groups of vigilantes to exact revenge and hopefully deter attacks because if i were raped i would rather take my chances as a defendant in court than as a complainant in a system that seems bent on proving that rape is a figment of malicious

the following correction was printed in the guardians corrections and clarifications column tuesday november in the article below we stated a woman named in the house of lords as a serial and repeated liar claimed she had made three allegations of sexual and physical assault including one against a man who spent more than three years in jail before his conviction was quashed last month during the editing process we made it appear that this complaint had been initiated by the womans mother and not by her in fact this was the case with a different complaint against a boyfriend she had as a teenager a woman who was named in the house of lords as a serial and repeated liar after a man found guilty of raping her had his conviction overturned says being outed in parliament was a setback for all victims of sexual assault the woman who has asked not to be identified despite her name now being in the public domain says she had no idea that the labour peer lord campbellsavours had named her on thursday until she was told by a journalist following the disclosure of her identity in hansard repeated in yesterdays daily mail she has gone into hiding lord campbellsavours used parliamentary privilege to name the woman during a debate on rape legislation he suggested that women who make false allegations of rape should be named and prosecuted for perjury it is believed to be the first time that the identity of a woman who claims to be the victim of a sexual offence has been revealed in parliament warren blackwell from daventry northamptonshire spent more than three years in jail for a sex attack before his conviction was quashed by the court of appeal last month the court ruled that mr blackwells conviction was unsafe in the light of new evidence that the complainant had made strikingly similar allegations of other sex attacks and had the ability to lie some newspapers have reported that she made previous allegations of sexual and physical assault she told the guardian yesterday that including the case of mr blackwell there had been three such instances the first relates to claims that she was sexually abused by her father who is now dead the second to a boyfriend she had as a teenager she says the third complaint was initiated by her mother who contacted police i dont go around falsely accusing men of raping me she said although mr blackwells conviction has been overturned she retains her right to anonymity because she has not been convicted of perverting the course of justice which would have established that the sexual assault never took place she claims she was attacked outside a village club early on new years day i had had a couple of drinks and went outside to get some air because my eyes felt sore i was knocked to the ground and drifted in and out of consciousness the attack was so intense i felt as if i was going to die when i went to court i told the truth because i had no reason to lie i was devastated when the conviction was quashed last month and hid at home with the curtains drawn for two weeks it was a complete shock when i found out id been named in parliament my whole world fell apart why cant they leave me alone this man was convicted on evidence from witnesses in court not only on my evidence why did lord campbellsavours decide to name me he doesnt know me has he ever spoken to a rape victim what gives him the right to destroy me my anonymity is supposed to be protected in law she says she is concerned not only about the ramifications for herself but also for other women who might now be more reluctant to report rape im just an ordinary person with dreams which have been shattered by all this now that ive been named in parliament ive become a target a spokesman for the criminal cases review commission said our referral to the court of appeal in this case was a result of new evidence relating to the key witness in the case and the issue of whether this offence actually took place a key factor was also the nondisclosure of material to the defence lisa longstaff of women against rape said we are appalled that lord campbellsavours used parliamentary privilege in the house of lords to aggravate the character assassination of this woman who reported rape his naming her is extremely dangerous not only for her but also for all women faced with the decision of whether to report rape the conviction rate for rape is little over this is partly due to the low priority given to investigating rape and the enormous legal obstacles and sexism women face in court most victims dont report to the police at all whats happening now could push the conviction rate down to near zero were seeing a backlash against everything women have been fighting for for years the government and police are encouraging women to report but when we do we risk being put on trial ourselves and now being jailed or hounded in the house of lords,2006-10,following correction wa printed guardian correction clarification

the government is drawing up laws to make it easier to convict men of rape if they have sex with a woman who has drunk so much that she may not know what she is doing ministers confirmed that they are planning to amend rape legislation to clarify the legal position on the issue of consent a change first revealed in the observer last december at stake is the question of whether a jury should convict when large amounts of alcohol have been consumed by the victim of an alleged attack mike obrien the solicitorgeneral said last night that they wanted to see more men convicted of raping a woman in such circumstances but also wanted to avoid wrongful guilty verdicts the issue of consent becomes particularly difficult where there is alcohol involved what we have to do is find ways of ensuring that where a rape occurs the rapist is convicted but that we dont create miscarriages of justice he said currently women are judged as being able to consent to sex if they have been drinking as long as they have not lost consciousness through excessive consumption cases in which the victim has drunk heavily before the assault occurs often do not make it to court because the police or the crown prosecution service think she will stand little chance of having her account believed by a jury the changes would not affect the burden of proof which means that jurors would still have to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that a rape had taken place obrien said that while the most recent changes to rape laws in were a big step forward in clarifying the law in relation to rape some recent cases have suggested that we may need to ensure that juries get the opportunity to take a view where significant amounts of alcohol are involved government lawyers were uneasy when a judge at swansea crown court told a jury last year to bring in a not guilty verdict on a man accused of raping a university student who admitted that she had drunk so much that she could not recall what had happened drunken consent is still consent said the judge ministers are also considering letting juries see the initial interview a victim has given to the police describing the attack often soon after it has happened and allowing women to be helped through the ordeal of a trial by having a victims advocate to support her,2006-10,government drawing law make easier convict men rape sex woman ha drunk

forget the movies the salad dressings forget even the signature baby blues paul newman will always be sainted in female minds for one reason and one reason only when questioned about fidelity to his wife joanne woodward he famously said why should i go out for a burger when i can have steak at home ahhh swooned all women so entranced by his chivalry they opted to ignore the fact that newman had effectively done the most sexist thing imaginable divide all female humanity into pieces of meat dead cow at that by contrast men everywhere on hearing the burgersteak analogy have been known to become suspiciously agitated just how big were these burgers that spoiled film star bastard newman was so airily waving aside how juicy how lean how many if he really didnt want them could they have them instead and in the back of the male mind the omnipresent niggle yes steak was very nice but day after day night after night forever a guy could develop indigestion its an ageold quandary why do men like dogs stray the answer might be within the question only recently it was revealed that over half the men who visited sex workers already had wives or partners moreover the latest publishing sensation in america is esther perels thesis mating in captivity which basically seems to argue that marriage works very well except for people who like sex it seems that the very things that make marriage so desirable familiarity security having someone to fetch the jaffa cakes are the archenemies of erotic passion putting it in newmans terms if perel had her way steaks of both sexes would start acting more like burgers striving to rediscover the creativity and spontaneity of the early days of their relationships all very interesting however is this the same old story of no man being satisfied with only one woman so we all have to run around being split personalities to keep them interested indeed are women once again copping the blame for not being sexy interesting ingenious enough to satisfy their men longterm when really their only crime is not to be someone different a wife can be beautiful clever amusing hot but she can never be someone other and sometimes that seems to be all some men want its why wayne rooney visited brothels proving that prostitution might be the oldest profession in the world but in liverpool at least it is rarely the easiest by contrast jude law claimed he cheated on sienna millar with the nanny because she was so busy with work she neglected him the needy not greedy plea then there are those alpha males who dont even bother with excuses making it clear that the concept of fidelity is up there with brain surgery and nuclear physics nope sorry im stumped all of which leads us to the oldest most hoariest excuse of all that being the human males biological destiny as the rationale goes men would love to be faithful but unfortunately evolution has other ideas for their little swimmers a grand plan no less hopefully involving lots

that first of all respect to the male gender they have been shamelessly peddling this mangottagoahunting bs for absolute aeons now and for the most part getting away with it in fact it has probably had its day as the male sexual get out of jail free card think about it did you ever see a man turning off the television at a crucial point in a sporting tournament running out of the room and crying oh no i have an uncontrollable urge to pursue my biological destiny no you havent because men can control themselves when they want to a lot of them simply dont want to then again a lot of women dont want to either indeed whats ultimately so annoying is that women appear to have been cast as the designated victims in this unmerry dance of sexual boredom but its the st century time for women to make it clear one man is simply not enough in fact two might be the absolute minimum one for the fun stuff one to fetch the jaffa cakes barbaraellenobservercouk,2006-10,forget movie salad dressing

the following correction was printed in the guardians corrections and clarifications column saturday october the headline on the article below was incorrect what the first paragraph of the report said was that employers could not award higher salaries to some workers solely on the grounds of long service here is an explanatory note from our legal editor clare dyer the length of service must enable the man to do his job better this will be presumed in the usual case so the employer need not justify it on a casebycase basis but in a case like bernadette cadmans where there are serious doubts about whether the length of service enables the man to do his job better than the woman the woman may now challenge the extra pay and the employer must justify it employers cannot lawfully pay some workers much higher salaries than others solely on the ground of long service the european court of justice ruled yesterday in a judgment that will force thousands of employers to review their pay schemes the ruling from luxembourg sets a precedent and means employers in the uk if challenged will be obliged in many cases to give a valid reason for paying thousands of pounds extra to someone with more experience and will not be able to merely cite years of service the decision will have a potentially huge impact on public sector employers including the civil service where wide differentials based on length of service are more common than in the private sector however it will not have an effect on women taking maternity leave despite some reports last night that the ruling would leave women who took time off after having a baby with no right to claim the same pay as male colleagues the confederation of british industry warned last night that experience was a critical factor for companies when deciding how much staff are paid the european court said experience generally enabled workers to perform their duties better and therefore warranted more pay but there were cases which raised serious doubts whether this was so and in those cases employers would have to justify in detail paying the longerserving workers more lawyers said that while it would generally be justified to pay someone with five years experience more than someone with one year it would be hard to justify much greater rewards for a worker with years experience compared with a colleague with or even eight years the courts decision is a victory for bernadette cadman a principal health and safety executive inspector who took her case to an employment tribunal five years ago after discovering that male colleagues in the same grade were earning between and more her union prospect which supported her claim described the case as the most important on equal pay to be brought in the past years ms cadman who was backed by the equal opportunities commission argued that a difference for male colleagues based on length of service amounted to sex discrimination because women were more likely to have career breaks and shorter service lawyers said it probably also contravened age discrimination laws which came into force this week ms cadman had been promoted more quickly than male coworkers yet was paid substantially less they earned more because they had worked for longer with the inspectorate although in a junior grade the case will go back to the court of appeal and probably then back to the tribunal where ms cadman could win a salary rise and six years backdated pay prospects general secretary paul noon said the ruling would have enormous implications not just across the public service but for any employer whose pay or benefits system unreasonably rewards length of time in employment including enhanced leave to reward years in service he added the government and the treasury pay lipservice to calls to modernise pay systems but now they will need to remove their heads from the sand he said the union had been told by the treasury that no additional funding would be

women who read the times splash headline this morning mothers lose right to equal salaries will understandably be spitting nails women who take time out of the workplace for maternity leave have no automatic right to the same pay as male colleagues who are doing the same job but have not had time off says the story about a ruling yesterday from the european court of justice in luxembourg fortunately its not correct service accrues during maternity leave so it doesnt affect pay rights in any event but given the different spin by unions and employers on the cadman ruling what does it actually mean is it a victory for women or employers for private sector employers its true that the ruling will probably have little impact few have pay scales which give much larger rewards for very long service but for women in public sector jobs particularly the civil service the judgment is a major advance a ruling from the european court in an earlier case appeared to bar women from arguing that it was sex discrimination to pay extra for long service even though women with their longer career breaks tend to cluster at the bottom of pay scales the court held that it was legitimate to pay more for experience because experience enabled employees to do the job better in bernadette cadmans case however the court has now held that while employers need not justify on a casebycase basis paying more for longer service where a woman can raise serious doubts about whether this is appropriate in her particular case the onus is on the employer to justify paying the man more the employer must then show that the mans extra experience enables him to do the job better in ms cadmans case she was promoted more quickly than her male colleagues who had longer service in a junior grade in the health and safety inspectorate one was getting a year to her but did his longer junior experience make him a better senior inspector than she was is someone in a whitecollar job with years experience necessarily better at his job because of that than someone doing the job for only years ms cadman argued the pay scales discriminated against women because they are more likely to have career breaks or to have come more recently into a field that was traditionally maledominated lawyers say the scales are also vulnerable to a challenge under the new age discrimination law which came into force this week because they appear to disadvantage younger workers ms cadmans case is now heading back to the court of appeal which referred the case to europe the appeal court is expected to refer the case back to the employment tribunal for hse to try to justify paying the men more her union prospect says it has other cases throughout the civil service which it now plans to take

over the past few days ive heard a lot of whingeing by employers about the new maternity rights which come into effect today mothers will now be entitled to nine months of paid leave six weeks on per cent of their normal pay and the rest at the statutory rate of a week rising to months at the end of the year disastrous say employers who complain that having to hold jobs open for such long periods means considerable disruption as they have to recruit cover or redistribute responsibilities one coaching consultancy last week pointed out that the extended maternity leave could backfire on mothers too as women who take long periods out of work tend to lose confidence and find it hard to return many mums will have little choice however about taking the maximum maternity leave decent childcare is now so expensive that it makes the return to work pointless if not impossible this is a particular problem for mothers in middleincome jobs who are required to work outside ninetofive hours while those who work the traditional eighthour day can use cheaper childminders and nurseries that close at six oclock mothers whose shifts extend beyond this point are forced to employ nannies at a rate of about a week excluding tax which the parent is responsible for paying or au pairs who while much cheaper about a week are usually young and inexperienced would you want to leave your baby with a yearold with little knowledge of childcare and rudimentary english the government has introduced these changes to help families and give children a good start but the end result could be resentful

women are the main breadwinners in one in five relationships and the shift in earning power is leading to increased tension between couples research showed today some of women questioned by skipton building society said they earned more than their partner while said they had argued about financial imbalances many respondents said they begrudged their male partners lack of earning power with one in six saying they resented him for not making more money and one in saying they disliked shouldering the financial responsibility in contrast in couples where the man was the higher earner just one in said they resented their female partner for not earning more jennifer holloway a spokeswoman for skipton said increasing earning power meant women needed to learn more about making the most of their money for a long time earning and managing money was firmly a male concern but as more and more women become the main breadwinner theres a need to ensure theyre as financially savvy as possible she said christine northam from advice charity relate said money management was an important element of relationships deeply held beliefs about malefemale roles and financial responsibility which could be wholly outdated can cause anger and resentment this can often lead to rows couples should try different ways to manage their outgoings and with any luck theyll settle on one that suits both partners being open and honest about money from the beginning is a good place to start caroline barker who earns twice as much as her partner and has always been the higher earner of the two said the gulf in salaries was not an issue in their relationship barker said she doesnt resent the fact that while he tries to find work as an actor she is doing better financially hes very talented and im

the role played by women in the economy is strange to say the least women do better than men at all levels of the educational system from primary school to university and the government wants britain to be at the cutting edge of the knowledge economy in which brains rather than brawn are the secret of success so it should be simple put the people with the smarts in charge and we would all be better off yet the latest evidence suggests that the thicker of the two genders remains firmly in control women may be making their presence felt in some of the professions medicine and the law for example but men are still firmly in control of high finance big business and the economics profession a quarter of the companies in the ftse dont have a single woman director and only one in eight of the directors appointed last year was female nor is it only in the old economy sectors that men rule the roost research sponsored by the dti and published last week showed that the number of women employed in it had continued to decline and now stands at just even more worryingly many of the women in it are employed in the lower skilled and lower paid areas the explanation for the underrepresentation of women at senior levels in the economy from policymaking to the boardroom is not entirely clear it could be argued that men are only in control temporarily women have only recently started to play a role in economic life but will play an increasingly important role as the nature of the economy changes this is a neat theory but ignores the fact highlighted by two papers to this months economic history society that women have influenced the commercial life of britain for centuries a paper by clare rose of the university of brighton showed that working women in the s had many problems that are familiar today securing equal pay for equal work the glass ceiling and how to find affordable clothes that presented a professional image as seen in trollope the last years of the th century saw a big expansion of women employed in offices as the novels of trollope highlight in the middle of the century clerks were usually men this changed with the introduction of the typewriter after there were women office workers in england but by the figure had risen to fear of immorality meant that women had separate entrances and worked in different offices conveniently this prevented them from comparing their pay and work with that of men a male clerk would expect to take home a year a female clerk a year for doing the same job even so the women faced distrust and hostility from male supervisors and colleagues rose notes however that up until this time women had tended to be factory hands shop assistants and servants but that their arrival in white collar jobs opened up new business opportunities women she says needed to dress in a way that showed they were prepared to work respectable but still feminine the fact that they were all young and unmarried added to the stress on their appearance the problem of what to wear in the office was solved by the development of business suits for women these were made in factories in manchester and london advertised in national press campaigns and sold by mail order a large number of the designs for business clothes were by women ellen ashwell designed more than for the same manufacturer and annette claxton worked for different manufacturers and also for herself these women and others were clearly working as commercial artists although their contribution has not been recognised judith spicksley of cambridge university showed that women in the late th century may have helped provide the seedcorn capital that prompted the transition to an industrial society well captured by the film shakespeare in love this was a time when england was witnessing the rise of a new capitalist class that was starting to challenge the landed gentry for economic and political supremacy in the film a daughter of a nouveau riche merchant falls for the bard but is betrothed by her father to an impecunious aristocrat in need of ready cash to invest in a virginian plantation after a brief fling viola de lesseps does her duty her father ploughs a good part of his fortune into the new world in exchange for status its a rollicking good tale but ms spicksleys research suggests that young unmarried women were indeed canvassed by those looking to raise funds for entrepreneurial forays on the other side of the atlantic there were still laws against the practice of usury but these did not apply to young single women who were not seen as making a living out of the activity of lending indeed lending for interest was one way for young spinsters to increase the size of their fortune hence increasing their attractiveness as brides ms spicksleys delving into consistory court records reveals the growing importance of lending by young single women at a time when there was a limited amount of cash in circulation she argues the release of this capital was important for the business community unlike young single men whose capital was more likely to be tied up in property or trade the cash held by single women was available for use but it was not just that the volume of available funds for investment increased women also tended to lend on far more benign terms they set interest rates below the prevailing quasimaximum under the usury laws made no additional charges for late payments and were prepared to excuse interest payments in a variety of circumstances aggression beliefs about status and position in early modern society combined with the way individuals experienced the benefits of their lending to ensure that such lending was not merely accepted but encouraged today it would be seen as investment rather than lending so if women were there at the birth of industrialisation why are more of them not making it to the top im not sure what the explanation is although the evidence is that men will not be prepared to give up their seats on the board without a fight one woman in a highflying job told me last week that she thought it had something to do with aggression you could teach intelligent women to be assertive but with men it came naturally this may be true but its not exactly comforting a survey released last week by the hay group found that men were far more ambitious than women and more likely to be highly motivated at work the workplace is no longer the preserve of men but the legacy of the maledominated workforce may be affecting womens prospects said emmanuel gobillot of the hay group our research suggests that the job roles we create values we prize and training we provide still fail to motivate women to the same degree as men,2006-11,role played

its bad news for hopes that government might be persuaded to go further faster on familyfriendly working bosses are getting nervous about the new entitlements brought in by the work and families act that come into force next april according to a survey by the human resources umbrella organisation the chartered institute for personnel and development only one in of their members think the new law will help their business even though they liked flexible working and say it has done all the things it promised by building loyalty and helping retain key employees this new legislation extends the right to flexible working from mothers of undersixes to carers of adults and maternity and adoption leave from six to nine months those changes come in next year sometime in the next three years shared parental leave will be introduced where once one parent has returned to work the other can take up the remaining leave the survey suggests it is because employers fear its complexity business hates taking on new employment policies that are going to cause headaches or at least the people wholl get the headaches the human resources managers do there are also mutterings about a lack of clarity from the department of trade and industry far more preoccupied by the energy review than by making sure that its new work and families act is ready to roll it has already bowed to business pressure by delaying the implementation of shared parental leave to it backed off altogether from extending the right to request flexible working for parents of older children even though it is the inability to get to the school gate or the school play or fete or parents day that makes mothers in particular consider giving up work in the first place ironically the tendency to come back after the first child and leave altogether after the second is just what makes smaller employers groan about the pointlessness of accommodating maternity yet far more women would stay in fulltime work if it was easier to get time off for those key parenting moments meanwhile the dti is plainly not going to take up any new ideas about rethinking the whole contract between employers and employees along the lines that campaigners like harriet harman are working on shed like to see employers as responsible for enabling employees to be good parents as they are for health and safety a controversial idea itself in its time the government under attack for overregulating is light years from accepting such a radical proposal but if the first great advance was equal pay legislation this could be the second in the long slow battle to the ideal of equality and the practical ambition of making it possible for mothers as well as fathers to combine parenting with working equal pay took rather more

it is a lifestyle many busy couples will recognise shift parenting where children are passed between parents like a baton in a relay race rarely spending time all together the phenomenon familiar to dualincome couples who work antisocial hours and weekends is eroding family life the constitutional affairs minister harriet harman will claim today arguing that children want time with both parents together doing activities that bond them her intervention is the latest in a battle between labour and the conservatives over the family from welfare secretary john huttons argument that two parents are better than one to david camerons offer of tax relief for child care and john reids emphasis on parenting classes parents have rarely been so courted or at times so criticised harman who is standing for the deputy labour leadership said that with the tories now chasing working mothers votes labour must stay ahead by tackling new issues including shift parenting and the trend for late motherhood where women put off childbearing into their late thirties and forties because they fear losing out on career advancement in a lecture this week for thinktank the fawcett society she will argue for changes at work including making the right for parents to work shorter or varied hours part of all britons employment contracts the impact when work isnt flexible is on how the parents feel about themselves if they feel it has a bad effect on the children it affects the marriage or relationship and over and over again you hear these examples she said we need to have a debate about how we enable families to spend more time together its not just about the child having enough time with the mother or the father its about doing things as a family one woman who worked in manufacturing told her she and her husband had to exchange the baby in the car park as one was rushing into work and another leaving it another described a complex arrangement whereby her baby was looked after on alternate days by its grandmothers and collected by whichever parent was available the mother looked quite bleak and at the end of it she said shifting our baby from place to place has shifted our marriage from place to place said harman shift parenting was identified by the national centre for social research which found many mothers started early in the office and finished early while their husbands worked late that meant fathers supervising the childs mornings and mothers the evenings but parents rarely being with the child together in this weeks speech she will also call for a network of experienced mothers who could advise others about bringing up children to act as a substitute for the wisdom once swapped at school gates by nonworking mothers she will also promise to create a website for parents to debate issues they want politicians to notice it would be modelled on the success of mumsnet the website with topics range from nanny problems to breastfeeding

once upon a time there was a crime called rape in recent years the laws on rape have been repealed not on statute but by public opinion now there is something called real rape it is a hideous crime but different to what used to be rape research published today in which no link to the daterape drug rohypnol was found in cases but in which many of the women had been drinking just goes to show that the idea that men are ever responsible for rendering women unconscious is ludicrous indeed it is women who are getting themselves drunk and therefore are wholly responsible for getting themselves raped but not as in real rape so it does not count real rape can only be committed against women possessing at least three of the following traits virginal sober of impeccable character elderly horrifically injured unknown to the accused drugfree mothers of small children or vicars daughters the rapist is required to be mad masked have previous convictions for sexual and violent crimes and keen to confess when caught they also need to have recorded the entire attack with the woman screaming no stop i mean it this is not an sampm game just in case he changes his mind in court and the jury believes that she likes sex that way in the bad old days any old woman could cry rape and sometimes even get away with it first women who had actually had sex with the accused or other men in her life previously would then claim that this time she was forced this type of complainant was soon weeded out new legislation was brought in as a trick that gave these slags a false sense of security it became supposedly almost impossible to introduce evidence of her previous sexual history but then if it got to court and some actually did the defence would slip it in through the back door and bingo the accused was acquitted and she had been taught a lesson never to try that one on again then came the women who would as a type of leisure activity such as shopping on ebay make false accusations of rape against poor innocent men she was soon taught a lesson as police began to arrest and often charge them with perverting the course of justice some women are now in prison for this offence which makes it extremely unlikely that women will report rape at all now thereby freeing up the police to catch real criminals so rest assured everyone numbers of rapes committed in the uk have fallen

a wellknown business woman once gave beth a researcher some excellent advice in the workplace she said never ever make the tea she knew that as a young woman in a professional job beth would be undermining her own position if she allowed herself to be put into roles typically associated with women this is similar to advice that katherine rake director of the fawcett society which campaigns for equality between men and women was once given a teacher told me to learn to type but never let anyone know that you can so why the fuss both tips were designed to stop women being pushed into typically female roles something that regularly happens in the workplace anecdotal evidence shows its still very common when it comes to things to do with nurturing caring and admin to ask a woman rather than to ask a man says rebecca gill policy officer for womens equality at the tuc rake agrees stereotypes about appropriate behaviour for women and men are very strong in peoples minds and this kind of thing happens all the time one of the problems is that you often only realise this after the event when you stop and think why was it me who was asked this regularly happens to nicole who works for a charity and who finds that when the pa and team administrator both women are away she is the first person her boss turns to for help with administrative duties once when my boss couldnt get hold of his pa and needed his diary checking he called me on my mobile rather than one of the more junior men at the office i definitely felt that it was because im a woman nicole hasnt said anything because she is concerned about causing a fuss but esther a yearold editor who was recently asked to stand in for the secretary at a meeting decided to make herself clear the secretary was away and we needed someone to take the minutes they immediately asked me i felt that it was because i was the only young woman there it was assumed that i would take on the secretarial role when esther declined it led to trouble with her manager i was put on the spot and ended up looking stroppy and my manager felt that i made her look stupid so if you feel you are being assigned a role just because you are a young woman how can you refuse it without ruffling too many feathers the situation covering for secretarial and reception staff ellen works in public relations when the people in the front office are away im always asked to cover the reception never one of my male colleagues because most secretarial and receptionist roles are filled by women people assume it is women who will stand in when needed how to refuse this is a workload issue says rebecca gill the individual has to decide whether its appropriate there and then to say no or whether to do it and bring up the issue later try using humour or cheekiness to draw attention to the issue suggests angela baron an adviser at the chartered institute of personnel and development angela mansi senior lecturer in occupational psychology at westminster business school agrees cheekiness gets you out of some tight corners so try saying lightly are you asking me because im a woman the situation pouring the tea when im in a meeting i make a point of never pouring the tea says sarah a project manager it might be difficult when youre all sitting there thirsty but by pouring the tea you are reinforcing the idea that this is womens work how to refuse ronnie fox is an employment specialist at the city law firm fox its not my job to do that is a phrase i have outlawed in the office he says if someone is asked to pour the tea because they are nearest the teapot then they should pour the tea but organisations that gender stereotype create unhappy employees and then they lose out commercially because people dont want to work in that kind of environment of course its ok to say no to things and if you think things are unfair you should go to your boss and say so its up to women not to offer says gill make yourself tea before the start of a meeting and take it in with you so who pours the tea isnt your problem the situation organising the christmas party it always falls to me to organise the office

its a familiar scenario you have worked your way up to a senior position in your dream career you have two adorable children but you are itching to get back to work as soon as possible no problem just find a nearby nursery and alter your working hours this is the st century of course you can have it all right but returning to work after giving birth isnt all plain sailing as thousands of parents find out each year according to the daycare trust the national childcare campaign the cost of a fulltime nursery place in britain for a child under two is more than per year thats a rise over five years and nearly more than inflation nannies can cost anything from to a week depending on whether they live in or out and more than twothirds of parents believe there is a lack of affordable childcare in their area moreover travelling times public transport problems and housing shortages in some parts of the country mean that even where money is available time and location dont make organising childcare very easy it comes as no surprise that being a stayathome mum and losing an income often works out cheaper but it looks like britain might finally be catching up with its european counterparts many of whom have wellbalanced childcare systems and a good number of working mothers last month beverley hughes the children young people and families minister announced that the government was investing m into helping small and mediumsized businesses provide childcare for their employees the scheme is meant to make it easier for parents to secure childcare closer to the workplace thus achieving that allimportant and increasingly elusive worklife balance whether the cash will actually make it easier for mothers to return to work remains to be seen in the meantime women are managing to be inventive with their childcare solutions here three of them share their experience of juggling working life with kids kate hammer is head of client services at tannissan mae communications a marketing and pr agency based in notting hill she has a twoyearold daughter audrey in fulltime nursery care audrey has been in fulltime childcare since she was sixandahalf months old at first divided between a nursery and an athome nanny and moving to fulltime nursery from months when hammer gave birth to audrey she was keen to continue working and hadnt really contemplated not doing so having been a nanny during university i had a pretty good idea what to look for when assessing our choices i was lucky in that while i was pregnant a familyrun nursery was planning a new site right in our neighbourhood the nursery opened around the time audrey was born and its great hammer considers herself lucky but she says poor public transport makes combining parenting and work so much more stressful if my journey was shorter i could stretch out my workday sneak in some exercise or get audrey home for supper and bath earlier all of which would be good at the same time my journeys to and from the office are just about the only time i spend alone so as long as the journey is smooth i can use the time to read the papers text friends and sometimes just daydream but this freedom comes at a price at more than a month nursery fees are my largest monthly bill by some distance its even more expensive when your child is under two she says with increased prices and increased flexible working more parents are going down the workingfromhome route but as angela kallabis has discovered this also isnt always the most ideal option kallabis works as a project coordinator at a power plant development company in central london she has a oneyearold boy and a threeyearold girl kallabis works a fourday week including two at home with the children in brighton while she and her husband find the situation works for them kallabis admits its sometimes hard to maintain her work discipline because its so much nicer playing with the kids or attending to their needs than doing work towards the end of the day it also becomes harder and harder to keep the toddler out of my office because she gets tired and bored and my husband doesnt always manage to keep her downstairs when hes cooking she adds the governments new initiative will enable businesses of fewer than employees provide onsite creche accommodation or help subsidise nearby childcare many public sector organisations already have onsite childcare with the civil service offering holiday schemes and a some fe colleges integrating childcare courses with subsidised creches claire crumpton from darlington was prompted to set up her own business after she experienced problems in finding prenursery childcare crumpton whos a qualified geography teacher took a year off when her son william now twoandahalf was born but when she tried to go back she found it nearly impossible to secure care i was keen to make sure william had the best possible nursery education and soon came to realise that there was an extensive waiting list for good quality childcare places in darlington i guess i was the typical neurotic mum but when i did find somewhere good it was too far away and i was so unhappy i cried every day for weeks crumpton who has since had another child annabel now runs learning together a nursery for babies toddlers and children up to five years old as well as a before and afterschool club now i am my own manager and i get to see my children when i like she says i am using my teaching skills and have staff under me so i can spend quality time with my children away from the nursery crumptons nursery is a year old and employs more than staff in addition she is studying for a degree in early years education crumpton applauds the governments new initiative but warns that it needs regulating properly you have to be

a woman who falsely claimed that her exhusband had raped her was jailed for a year yesterday and branded a wicked liar by the judge sally henderson claimed richard cooke had repeatedly raped her

its a new trend which will stop women from coming forward and making rape complaints margaret gardener director of the false allegations support organisation said the worst thing about this case is it could put genuine rape victims off coming forward but she said men wrongly accused of rape struggled to cope many men who ring us are suicidal they have to try and get their lives back together they

appoint a woman to run a top business reflects the thcentury attitudes that still prevail in many of britains boardrooms most leading companies are run by a selfperpetuating elite of middleaged white men who recruit in their own image and find women not to mention ethnic minorities an exotic choice of colleague the underrepresentation of women and even more so ethnic minorities in the top ranks of business is shameful not just in britain but in much of the developed world before ms carrolls appointment the only two women in charge of ftse companies were dame marjorie scardino at pearson the publishing company and dorothy thompson at drax the power operator the situation is getting worse rather than better there are only female executive directors at ftse companies compared with last year there are women serving as nonexecutive directors but more than a quarter of ftse firms have no female directors while half of graduate recruits to the business world are women the proportion reaching senior levels falls to and to just in executive roles this is no reflection of womens unwillingness to put in the hours a report this week by the institute of directors looked at companies and found that female directors worked longer hours for less pay than their male colleagues yesterday the london business school launched the lehman brothers centre for women in business yet another initiative funded by the investment bank to find out why women are failing to break through the socalled glass ceiling professor lynda gratton who runs the centre says she wants to call on business leaders to help draw up industry standards for promoting women and creating a working environment that breaks away from the traditional maledominated model however we have been here before three years ago the higgs review of corporate governance launched an initiative to encourage a more diverse range of nonexecutive directors into the boardroom suggesting recruiters fish in a wider pool for independent board members this has however largely not happened part of the problem for women is that many networking and social opportunities to build the contacts that help them advance in an organisation are focused around predominantly male pursuits such as golf and drinking sessions women do not always push themselves forward either one leading chief executive told me recently that women do not posture and show off in meetings as men do believing that if they are competent and do their job well they will get on however that does not necessarily get them noticed in a competitive environment rivals will focus on any perceived weakness to get a leg up the corporate ladder and women can suffer from their lack of profile it is no accident that many top businesswomen in britain are americans who can be more aggressive in promoting themselves men often focus on womens family commitments as reasons for them bowing out of the race for the top but there is no shortage of ambitious women the business world is missing out on a lot of talent by not thinking more creatively about how to harness womens ambitions in the boardroom after all in many cases the vast majority of customers served by these companies are women and it is surely damaging to the business that they are not represented in the top ranks tesco for example britains biggest privatesector employer has a predominantly female workforce and customer base but not one female executive director it is the same at marks amp spencer the dearth of women in the corporate upper echelons means the business world is lagging a long way behind progress made by women in politics and the public sector so far there is no talk of legislation but that is what norway has done companies listed in oslo have another months to ensure that women hold of board positions or be threatened with closure what i cant understand is why investors do not put more pressure on boards to recruit more women since there is a hard business case to be made for it that could be because most of them are men as well the solution to getting more women into top business jobs is complex and requires more imaginative thinking than has been seen in the boardroom for some time but the problem has been discussed for far too long what we need is action businessmen are supposed to be risk takers it is about time they took some deborah hargreaves is the

while political pundits will pore over david blunketts recently published diaries for the inside story of new labour many readers will be more interested to find out what he has to say about his affair with kimberly quinn and very public court battle regarding contact with their child yet there is nothing new in blunketts professed desire to be a good father and part of this little lads life his story is just one in a stream of mens accounts of their pain as fathers denied access to their children we live in a time of heightened public media and political interest in the issue of the responsibilities and rights of all fathers this interest is maintained in part by the highprofile stunts of an increasingly vocal and wellorganised fathers rights movement most visibly represented in the uk by fathers justice such groups suggest that laws once favouring fathers have now swung too far in the opposite direction establishing men as the new victims protesters demand a redressing of the balance through reform of child support law changes to contact rights and a presumption that children will spend equal time at the home of each parent following separation why has the fathers rights movement gained such momentum now one explanation that has proved attractive to some parts of the media is the idea of backlash most famously discussed by the us author susan faludi who describes a powerful counterassault against the achievements of feminism as women gain more influence outside the household she suggests men lose their traditional role and authority both at home and in the workplace inevitably men fight back and gender wars result this is one of the claims examined in a new collection of essays by leading commentators on family law and policy in five countries it argues that the image of backlash fails to capture the complex realities of contemporary family life which cannot be reduced to a balance sheet in which men proportionately lose what women gain in power and rights a more accurate explanation of the current high profile of fathers rights might rather be found in a more complex mixture of factors specifically longterm upward trends in divorce rates and numbers of single parent families mean that fathers increasingly find themselves living apart from their children and their relationships with them may thus be more fragile the greater fragility of the paternal bond sits uneasily with changing social expectations of men as fathers today the good father is expected not merely to be a provider but also a handson caring parent who is able to connect emotionally with his children the findings of therapeutic psychological and sociological research suggest a qualitative shift in many mens emotional relationships with their children and commitments to family life society is demanding that men become more involved as fathers precisely at a time when in certain respects it is more difficult for them to do so the current struggles of the fathers rights movement can be understood as part of this complex and painful renegotiation of intimate relations against a backdrop of changing lifestyles and expectations while the social reality is complex the rhetoric of the fathers rights movement has a beguiling logic and simplicity what is needed they suggest is nothing more than justice for fathers and justice requires that men and women receive equal treatment before the law but is it really so easy should mothers and fathers be treated in exactly the same way and what would this mean symbolic recognition what tends to be systematically effaced in such arguments are questions about the consequences of applying genderneutral norms to what remain despite all assertions to the contrary highly gendered fields of practice in a context where mothers continue to shoulder the bulk of daytoday care of children before separation does a split of caring postseparation represent justice and how do children fare if residence is awarded equally across two households it may be that the fathers rights movements demand for equality should not be heard primarily as a call for practical change but rather as a demand for symbolic recognition the failure to accord fathers equal contact time with their children may cause psychological harm to mens sense of their worth as fathers being perceived as according to them secondary importance to their childrens mothers fathers rights movement websites are full of powerful and moving accounts of fathers pain at being allowed to see their children only at formally sanctioned narrowly prescribed times while mothers as resident parents retain seemingly unlimited access to them even for men whose long working hours had left little time to spend with their children in the context of intact families that a court should determine when contact should occur may understandably seem an intolerable breaking of the bond between father and child it is no wonder then that family law has become a particular target for the anger and frustration of fathers rights campaigners the research suggests that the fathers rights movement has enjoyed limited direct success in achieving its aims in the uk and elsewhere in the uk the goal of a presumption of shared equal parenting on separation has been unequivocally rejected by the government of which david blunkett was himself once part however while the movements campaigns may have failed in this sense it may have succeeded in less tangible ways most notably in influencing the contours of popular debate in the guardian as elsewhere concerns are now regularly expressed by politicians academics legal practitioners and a range of organisations about mens lack of involvement in their childrens lives that fathers deserve equality is often proclaimed with little interrogation of what this means in practice and it seems often to be assumed that legal reform is capable of solving these problems with no consideration of what might realistically be expected of law in this area it is perhaps not only the benefit of hindsight that lends such poignancy to the intervention of a rather younger david blunkett in a parliamentary debate on assisted reproduction in the early s arguing that reproductive technologies should not be available to single women blunkett claimed child bearing is not a right it is part of the unfathomable life force that is why man and woman together must take responsibility for the wellbeing and love of the child what remains unstated in this seductive vision of mutuality is what happens when relationships break down and how calls for equal rights for all parents can guide us through the messy bitter turmoil that all too often accompanies divorce or separation while it is right that the pain experienced by individual fathers and indeed of children and mothers should keep questions of parental rights and responsibilities high on political agendas there are no easy

a legal case involving the rape of a teenage girl has provided new and disturbing evidence of the difficulties in achieving convictions in rape trials the observer can reveal rebecca was in january when she claims she was raped by a man in his late twenties near her home in south london she had agreed to meet him but says she was tricked into going to his house where he attacked her now she says she did not want to report the rape for fear of reprisals and the ordeal of a court case but was persuaded to do so by her mother in the belief that the man who had attacked her would be punished but his trial at the inner london crown court earlier this year ended with his acquittal on charges of rape and witness intimidation rebecca whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity said you have this thing in your head that because you know you are telling the truth you think he will be punished then when he was found not guilty i cant describe it i just felt so let down and like the law couldnt protect me rebecca and her mother angela again not her real name blame the acquittal on a catalogue of failures by police officers who investigated the case the prosecuting barrister and the judge they have lodged a formal complaint about the way the case was handled i have always believed in our criminal justice system said angela when something like this happens what else can you do but go to the police and trust them to sort it out she wanted to drop the case and i said no this man cant get away with what he has done now i feel i have let my daughter down the failure of the police to arrest the suspect until three months after the report of rape the loss of vital evidence from the girls mobile phone and the failure to interview staff at a shop where a visibly distressed rebecca had gone after the attack are among the issues angela has raised with southwark police she has also criticised crown prosecution service counsel for their decision not to charge the defendant with sexual intercourse with a minor alongside the rape accusation i know that mistakes have been made mistakes that may have lost us the case angela writes in her letter of complaint and as much as the officers on the case were always respectful to us and we will always be grateful for that certain questions have to be answered so that everyone else who has to go through what we went through will get a fair and thorough investigation when reporting a serious lifechanging crime like rape southwark police accepted some of the failures at a meeting with the family and their mp simon hughes last week this was obviously a desperately sad and awful private tragedy for the girl and her family hughes said if the police had done their job properly and the cps had been more on the ball the chances of conviction seem to me to have been greater the police have owned up to their mistakes and locally seem determined to learn every lesson official figures show that only per cent of reported rapes end in a conviction ruth hall from women against rape said this is not an isolated case it is typical now because of the persistence of rebecca and angela this is a great opportunity for the police and the cps to clean up their act rebecca did not initially tell her parents about the rape only breaking down after seeing her alleged attacker a month later six months before the trial she saw him again he threatened to throw acid in my face if i took it to court nearly two years on from the rape she describes the court case as devastating but says the experience has made her stronger in the courtroom they suggested i was a liar that i wasnt raped that i asked for money she says to talk in that detail and tell the truth and bring up a memory you dont want to and for someone to tell you that you are lying is very difficult malcolm tillyer borough commander of southwark police admitted that mistakes were made and said he had ordered a fresh review of the case rape and the courts per

plans to allow men who beat their partners or former partners to escape custody by pleading remorse have been dropped in guidance for judges on sentencing for domestic violence the sentencing guidelines council had originally proposed that remorseful offenders could be punished with a community order or a suspended sentence but the final guidance published yesterday omits the suggestion after protests from the home office minister lady scotland and womens groups the council whose guidance will be relied on by judges in england and wales in passing sentence said it was pointed out that remorse is impossible to measure particularly in light of the recognised domestic violence cycle of violence followed by remorse and that reference to remorse should be deleted judges are now told to treat domestic violence as seriously as violence elsewhere and to sentence accordingly serious violence normally calls for a jail sentence it says however while remorse is no longer a factor judges may pass a noncustodial sentence if satisfied that both parties genuinely want to try to save their relationship and that the victim will not be put at risk of further violence judges are also told to bear in mind that a victim who pleads for mercy for her abuser may be acting under pressure from the offender the guidelines say domestic violence may be more serious than other violent crimes because of aggravating factors such as abuse of trust the impact on children or forcing the victim to leave home judges are told to consider the victims vulnerability when sentencing offenders including cultural religious language or financial factors a victim should be regarded as particularly vulnerable if she was pregnant at the time of the assault claims by abusers that they were provoked should be treated with great care the guidance says provocation is likely to have more of an effect as mitigation if it has taken place over a significant period of time,2006-12,plan allow

when amanda stepped off a boat in southampton earlier this year she had she says just escaped a police cell in west africa where she had been raped sexually assaulted and tortured by guards and fellow prisoners suffering from severe abdominal pain and the trauma of leaving her two young children behind she believed she had reached safe ground but days after her arrival in britain she was taken to a detention centre and locked up for a month during which time her asylum claim was rejected with no legal representation at her appeal amanda was forced to relive her ordeal before a judge she found hostile and who accused her of lying about the rape the appeal was turned down campaigners say such experiences are far from unusual although it is estimated that at least of women seeking asylum in the uk have experienced rape or sexual violence in their countries of origin a report published yesterday found that in two thirds of cases rape claims were dismissed as fabrications misjudging rape was commissioned by the black womens rape action project and women against rape to draw attention to the behaviour of immigration judges who serve on the asylum and immigration tribunal ait which decides appeals against rulings made by the home office as the home office refuses around of claims following initial asylum interviews the two londonbased groups argue that fair ait hearings are essential the report examined rulings by these immigration judges and found that rape claims were believed in only of cases the level of disbelief was often justified by the view that the woman had failed to mention the rape in the initial stages of the claim and must therefore be making it up cases where allegations were disbelieved included a yearold girl who said she was raped by ugandan government agents in front of her father an opposition politician having reached and had her asylum claim rejected she faces repatriation then there is the ethiopian muslim woman whose description of rape was rejected on the basis that she had not complained to family members this was described as making no sense at all only a third of women in the cases examined had access to an independent report by a doctor psychiatrist or specialist organisation to corroborate their rape claims at the hearing where adjournments were requested for the preparation of such reports immigration judges refused in more than of cases in our experience most judges are dismissing women and destroying their credibility says cristel amiss of the black womens rape action project all the evidence confirms our fears that women and girls are being used as a soft target to bring down the asylum figures amanda who is in her s finds it hard to talk about what happened after she was arrested for allowing antigovernment meetings to take place in the business she ran in her home country her hands shake and she cries as she speaks the guys in the cell pushed me one said i have to pay charges one of the guys forcibly had sex with me one asked me to suck his manhood i did it because i had no choice when the shift changed the guards were insulting me the officer came in and grabbed me by the hair and took me to the toilet he had sex with me the other ones were laughing amanda escaped with the help of a guard and a local pastor who arranged her passage from the station to the nearest fishing port from where she made her way to southampton several months ago she was taken to yarls wood immigration removal centre we entered a van with a cage inside and i remember reaching a place with a high gate i was thinking i would meet people who would help me but there was nobody to say what was happening i thought maybe they are going to behead me at yarls wood amanda was promised access to a lawyer but says she met one only five minutes before her initial home office interview giving no time to relate her experiences before the interview began her claim was rejected she fared no better at the appeal hearing before the ait a month later a lawyer had been appointed by legal aid but failed to appear and amanda says she was left to tell the court her story without legal advice amanda says the immigration judge refused requests both from her and from home office officials to adjourn the case allegedly saying the hearing could go ahead without her solicitor he then described her supporting documents as forgeries and dismissed her account of rape even after she showed him where the guard had ripped out her hair in his ruling the judge described rape as a terrible crime but said it was also terrible to make false allegations because genuine complaints were more likely to be disbelieved amiss says this judge has used exactly the same argument in several other rulings louise hooper a barrister who regularly represents women at ait hearings says she has worked in other areas of law but ive never seen a court so partisan in nature not all judges are bad but there is a cohort who do not believe anything that anyone claiming asylum ever says frankly they appear to see it as their role to keep people out it is widely accepted that women face an uphill struggle to prove their refugee status under the un convention on refugees which states that a person may be recognised as a refugee owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion this is partly because womens political activity often takes a different form to mens hiding people for example or like amanda cooking for political meetings which is harder to prove than membership of a party it is also because they are targeted in different ways the most obvious method being rape a common weapon of war and political oppression which unlike torture is not explicitly recognised by the convention to correct this imbalance the un has urged countries to adopt guidelines to ensure womens asylum claims are dealt with equitably to its credit the immigration appellate authority the forerunner to todays ait published such guidelines for adjudicators now immigration judges in to ensure that procedures do not prejudice women asylum seekers but the new report alleges that immigration judges routinely flout these guidelines dismissing womens political activity as low level and arguing as a result that rape cannot be considered as persecution under the convention womens failure to report rape during the early stages of their applications combined with a lack of corroborating medical evidence is often used to discredit claims revealing little understanding of the trauma and shame particular to rape despite all the gender guidelines judges often start from the position that a woman is lying says anver jeevanjee a former member of the ait who retired in they demand a much higher degree of proof from women the idea that they wouldnt tell their husbands or family members about a rape for example is regarded as absolutely implausible jeevanjee claims that during his year career with the tribunal he frequently heard racial slurs being used by judges in private and the attitude that there are already too many immigrants in britain was common a spokesman for the ait told this newspaper that the asylum gender guidelines produced by its predecessor are not binding now living in

your article noted that women do better than men at all levels of the education system women still have to fight for room at the top november our research shows that it doesnt stop there when you look at the behaviours needed for high performance leadership in the business world strategic thought relationshipbuilding influence power and communication women actually have a higher overall average capability than men so why arent the equally if not more capable people in society running the show the article presented several potential answers women will play an increasingly important role as the nature of the economy changes men will not be prepared to give up their seats on the board without a fight and the job roles we create values we prize and training we provide still fail to motivate women to the same degree as men while all these may be true to certain degrees i believe a recent insight on one of our diversity programmes gets to the nub of the issue a group of male managers at an investment bank were discussing the reasons they believed women werent joining them at the top the discussion turned to some of the organisations women just one or two rungs down the career ladder one woman was criticised for not being demanding enough of people who didnt deliver another was described as being hardassed and difficult interestingly one of your commentators thought the reason women werent making it to the top had something to do with aggression you could teach intelligent women to be assertive but with men it came naturally but when our discussion turned to what the investment bank could do to address the lack of women at the top several said they were not in favour of anything that turned the women into men what became increasingly evident to me from this session is that it appears there is a very narrow bandwidth of acceptable behaviour for many women in the workplace men have greater freedom to express their different personalities as long as they deliver the goods whereas women are heavily scrutinised and criticised if they stray outside the behaviour defined by their male bosses this is not an isolated case in my experience of boardrooms and senior teams the way you need to be to get on around here can directly prevent women from achieving senior positions all too often a visit to the top floor of a big finance house sees men dropping in on their colleagues and bosses to talk about their latest achievements this tends to come more naturally to men than women the actual achievements of the two groups differ little in fact the women often achieve more but the men are seen to be achieving my concern is that if women simply wait for the freedom to achieve results in their own way then we could be waiting a very long time our challenge is to help women understand and operate more effectively in this alien environment while affecting organisational change so that they have the freedom to express their personalities and deliver the goods to the same degree as their male colleagues julia payne is chief executive of the centre for high performance development juliapaynechpdcom if you wish to respond at greater length

ive been a journalist for years and i thought there was not too much about the human species potential to cause hideous damage to its own that i havent encountered i think of a murder trial transcript that i read as a young journalist in australia the details of which i still remember in detail a mark of its effect on me the victim was a woman whose husband had sacked one of her two attackers from a casual job she was tied to a tree and tortured for three days primarily with broken bottles before she died virtually all of the testimony was considered far too harrowing for print so while all the journalists knew the true horror of the story the public could not in recent years many of those cultural restrictions on reporting have fallen away and sometimes you cant but fear that horrible detail of individual crimes is being offered up for little more than the titillation of horror but sometimes with shocking stories as with shocking photos it is only by telling all of that horror that the truth of a situation particularly if it is a situation affecting millions can be told last week i read a story so shocking so harrowing that its taken me days to come to terms with it it has been told before but never in such shattering detail the story is here and you really shouldnt click on that link if you fear an account of sexual violence might do you harm a respected news organisation which has obviously done a lot of research has come up with a story that seems beyond the imagination of the wildest piece of babies on bayonetsstyle propaganda ive long known and in a very small way tried through donations to the wonderful fistula hospital in addis ababa about the problem of fistula usually caused by unassisted prolonged childbirth which causes internal damage that can leave women doubly incontinent and consequently outcasts from their community but in the congo as unbelievable as it sounds rapes often mass rapes are being accompanied by deliberate wounding sometimes with guns sometimes with blunt objects causing the same type of injury and this is not the odd case or even scores of cases this is systematic almost organised brutality on the scale of at least tens of thousands of attacks all the armed men rape says doctor mukwege when we see a lesion we can tell who the perpetrator is there are special methods of each group types of injuries theres a word in that quote on which ive been lingering men virtually all of the violence in the congo is being inflicted by men on women just as virtually all of the violence in the world whether it be done by individual or organised army is done by men and yes before you comment i know that women too can sometimes be violent hideously violent but it is a very small fraction of the violence in the world it is impossible not to ask two questions why and how can it be stopped as to the first well you could ask clerics psychologists sociologists and many more professionals and get many different answers but it seems from the testimony from the congo that whatever theory you wrap it up in the basic answer to this question is that this is a society entangled in a web of nonstop violence maybe the attackers themselves were attacked or saw family members attacked or even just fear being attacked so they lash out and they lash out at people they are pretty sure cant defend themselves cant hit back have even less power than do they and in most parts of the world perhaps in every part of the world that means the women im not talking about sheer brute muscle power here there the sexual difference are small the real differences are cultural women dont have the arms women dont have the resources but most of all women dont have the cultural respect the selfrespect the belief in themselves to stand up collectively and individually against the violence to claim power and influence against their attackers now im not blaming the victim here very much not the powerless arent in that state because they chose it they are there because that is where their societies and other societies have put them only by raising up the women will these easy targets be removed and while i dont think giving all the women aks would be the answer i cant help thinking that the british armys decision to recruit female gurkhas is one small step along the way but there is an even bigger than why what is the world doing about the congo theres a small and minimally equipped peacekeeping force that helps keep a president in power in kinshasa there are a few horribly stretched ngos helping as many individual women as they can in effect what the world is doing is nothing nothing at all and thats possibly even more depressing than the accounts of the violence postscript the guardian last week reported on a charity that is helping some of the victims of congo violence who escape to britain,2006-12,ive journalist year thought wa much human specie potential cause hideous damage havent encountered think
